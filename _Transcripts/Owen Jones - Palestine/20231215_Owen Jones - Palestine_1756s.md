Video Description: Ariel Bernstein is a former IDF combat soldier who fought in Gaza in 2014. Now he campaigns for peace and against the occupation. This is one of the most fascinating interviews I've done - he tells me about his experience in Gaza, about dehumanisation, Israel's wartime propaganda - and where this is all heading.

# This Israeli Soldier Fought In Gaza. Now He Speaks Out
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [December 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I)
*  Hello, hello, hello. I'm delighted today to be joined by Ariel Bernstein, who is a former IDF [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=0.0s)]
*  combat soldier who took part in the 2014 war in Gaza. He's now involved in campaigning, activism [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=5.84s)]
*  against the occupation and for peace, generally. Ariel, it's great to see you. How you doing? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=13.52s)]
*  I'm doing all right. You know, in relation to what's going on, it's kind of difficult to say, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=19.6s)]
*  but of course, today, thank you for inviting me, by the way. It's an honor. It's an honor. And I [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=26.24s)]
*  know these are difficult times and these are difficult things to talk about, but we will, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=31.68s)]
*  we will. Yeah, we'll give it a shot. And this is a very safe, comfortable space for you to speak. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=37.92s)]
*  Just tell me firstly about your experiences then. You were a soldier back in 2014 and it was a very [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=47.2s)]
*  different kind of war conflict. This is on a whole new level. No question about that. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=52.32s)]
*  But just tell me, just tell me, just tell me what's your kind of abiding [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=58.32s)]
*  memory from that experience? What was the key lessons you learned from that experience? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=63.44s)]
*  Yeah. So I served between 2012 and 2015 in a reconnaissance unit called Sayeret Nachal. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=68.32s)]
*  And I was, before entering, we had another operation that was quite large, but nobody [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=76.56s)]
*  remembers because what we call protective edge, Suketan, or the 2014 war kind of overshadowed [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=86.0s)]
*  the other operation that came before, which was called My Brother's Keeper, in which we searched [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=92.4s)]
*  in the West Bank for the bodies, what became known to be the bodies, but were kidnapped teenagers. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  And during those weeks of being in the West Bank, just to give you like kind of the mindset that I [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=106.48s)]
*  entered Gaza with, we were told we're searching for these teenagers, but we were also taking advantage [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=112.8s)]
*  of this moment where there is like public legitimacy to display power and more force in the West Bank. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=120.08s)]
*  So we were basically searching for them, but also demonstrating our presence, our power, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=128.96s)]
*  and also searching for any clue for anything suspicious, which is basically anything that you [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=135.04s)]
*  decide is suspicious. And so for weeks during this operation, I don't remember exactly how many days, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=142.24s)]
*  I was a commander and I was choosing homes to enter and to invade and to search, which basically [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  means to enter a house in the middle of the night of a family, flip all the furniture, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=156.64s)]
*  terrify the family, not find anything usually because you're just choosing homes randomly and [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=161.92s)]
*  move on. When the idea is kind of we will display our force and then they will regret ever like [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=168.0s)]
*  basically fucking with us. And doing these missions as a commander already started to [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=177.6s)]
*  really bother me and I started to question the whole mission that we were doing, but then [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=183.27999999999997s)]
*  Hamas started shooting rockets from Gaza and we are told that we're preparing for an invasion [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=189.44s)]
*  into Gaza. And I come with all these questions and a feeling that I'm not very motivated or [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=198.0s)]
*  not really believing in this kind of system that I'm serving. So entering Gaza was already something [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=203.68s)]
*  that was kind of complicated for me because I wasn't sure I believe in it, you know, and what [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=209.92s)]
*  we're doing. But I was so committed to my teammates or my unit mates, the guys that were [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=216.32s)]
*  serving with me, which are still good friends until today, even though I'm an anti-occupation [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  activist, I felt like I don't really have the option to not go in. So entering already was kind [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=228.64s)]
*  of a complicated moment for me. And every time there is a war in Gaza, we can speak more about [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=235.6s)]
*  what I saw and what I did and what I think about it, but every time there is an escalation, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=243.2s)]
*  it's not like there was 2014 and now the 7th of October, 23. Every year in Israel, we have what [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=247.44s)]
*  we call a round of violence, which is a normalized way of calling basically aggression, escalation, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=254.72s)]
*  war, violence. Every time this happens, which is quite often, it brings me back to that moment [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=261.68s)]
*  where we cross the fence into this place that we've never been into and we only heard scary [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=268.96s)]
*  things about where everybody inside are terrorists that want to kill you. So physically, just to [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=274.0s)]
*  answer your question simply, when I see these images, it really has an effect on every time [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=280.64s)]
*  there's an escalation. I'm interested in that point about civilians, I suppose, because you said, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=286.15999999999997s)]
*  you know, you were kind of what's driven into you, into your heads is that these are terrorists or [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=291.44s)]
*  extremists. And we've heard, I suppose, from senior Israeli politicians talking about things [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=296.96s)]
*  like human animals, that there were no innocents in Gaza, as the former Foreign Minister Avogor [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=302.56s)]
*  Libyden put it, for example. The Israeli president, I suppose, talking about collective guilt, that [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=310.64s)]
*  kind of stuff. I mean, you wrote in a Guardian article, really good, brilliant Guardian article, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=317.76s)]
*  you wrote, since the Israeli military had ordered civilians to leave the neighborhood, anyone who [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=322.96s)]
*  remained was, so we were told, a Hamas operative or supporter and therefore a legitimate target. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=326.0s)]
*  I'm just interested in that, because obviously, in terms of the rules of war, that isn't how the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=330.64s)]
*  rules of war work in terms of international law, Geneva Conventions. But so I'm interested kind of [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=335.2s)]
*  what, how that was expressed and how that actually played out on the ground. Yeah, well, first of [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=340.08s)]
*  all, I don't really know exactly what the laws of war, international laws of war are. So it's hard [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=346.24s)]
*  for me to tell, especially even now as an activist, but especially as a soldier, you have no idea [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=352.56s)]
*  about those things. Of course. Commander is probably. But there's a logic behind, the logic [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=356.88s)]
*  behind the way we fight in Gaza, the way I experienced it, and I don't think it changed [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=363.52s)]
*  ever since, is that you tell the residents of a certain neighborhood that you want to fight in [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=368.88s)]
*  or do you want to conquer, that you're coming in and they have to leave. They have an X amount [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=374.56s)]
*  of time to leave. So once you warn them, in your eyes, whoever stayed is either actively [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=380.24s)]
*  participating in the war as a Hamas member or collaborating because we told them to leave. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=387.04s)]
*  So once you warn the population, this area becomes a battleground. It's not a neighborhood [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=391.84000000000003s)]
*  anymore, at least in your eyes, a soldier, you did your part or you did what you needed to do [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=397.2s)]
*  to tell them to get away. So if they stay, it's their fault and you don't really stop to think [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=403.2s)]
*  about that too much. And most people don't also after they leave the army. And for many in Israel, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=410.64s)]
*  that's even considered something that's too humane. Like, why are we doing this when actually it's [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=416.96s)]
*  just a way of legitimizing the area to be a battleground. It's not actually, I don't think [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=421.76s)]
*  it's actually to help people save their lives. Now going into fighting in Gaza compared to what [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=427.04s)]
*  I've experienced in the West Bank is a completely different story. Because we do this kind of, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=436.16s)]
*  we treat neighborhoods as battlegrounds and we treat it as total war and we don't want to deal [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=444.48s)]
*  with civilian populations. We don't make a difference. Whoever stayed is a legitimate [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=451.6s)]
*  target. Then we enter with much like another level of engagement of firepower that I've ever [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=456.16s)]
*  seen. It's completely a different scale. There's this idea of we take zero risks on our own [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=464.08000000000004s)]
*  so the way you enter is with very, very heavy artillery and bombings from above, from the sky. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=472.72s)]
*  And this makes you feel much more confident as a soldier who's entering. And it leaves a level of [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=482.96000000000004s)]
*  destruction that I've never experienced before in anything I did in the West Bank. Another example [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=488.8s)]
*  for that could be the way we enter homes in Gaza. Before that in the West Bank you maybe invade a [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=495.84s)]
*  home. You're not really asking if you can enter or not. You maybe break the door. You maybe kick the [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=503.2s)]
*  door or do whatever you need to get in. But in Gaza you don't even go through the door because [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=508.47999999999996s)]
*  it might be trapped. So you fire a rocket from a shoulder rocket into the wall and you enter through [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=513.92s)]
*  the wall. So the way we're like engaging with this whole area is completely different. We were there [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=520.48s)]
*  for like two weeks, I'd say maybe three. And as you're there you start to see it becomes more [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=527.9200000000001s)]
*  difficult to treat the place as if it's just a battleground because you're actually staying [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=536.64s)]
*  in people's homes. At least that's the way it was for me. You start seeing family photos, signs of [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=540.96s)]
*  life, of people who live in this place, school books. We heard of a family that was that one of [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=546.88s)]
*  our units met in one of the homes and they let her die in the bombings from above, from fighter jets. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=555.76s)]
*  So this kind of idea that everybody who stayed is engaged in fighting and that we're in a [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=565.2s)]
*  battleground, it's hard to keep it when you actually see that you're in a neighborhood. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=572.8s)]
*  And to your point that has to do with the dehumanization, I think once you start to [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=579.04s)]
*  question that or to feel like that idea crack, then you have two options. Either you start [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=584.4799999999999s)]
*  questioning the whole thing that you're doing or you have to turn to dehumanization because [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=589.8399999999999s)]
*  then if you don't do that you're left with a lot of guilt I believe. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=598.64s)]
*  I mean, linked to that, do you think for IDF soldiers currently in Gaza have vengeance, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=603.4399999999999s)]
*  I suppose, in their heads and that vengeance has been maybe legitimized by, I suppose, those higher [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=608.9599999999999s)]
*  up in the army but also politicians and when they say vengeance it doesn't simply mean in their heads [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=616.9599999999999s)]
*  saying identifying Hamas members for example but the risk is any civilian in Gaza could be [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=624.88s)]
*  on the receiving end of that vengeance. What's your sense of kind of how many IDF soldiers maybe [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=632.8s)]
*  are currently thinking right now and how sanctioned that might be? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=636.7199999999999s)]
*  I think naturally after seeing what happened on the 7th of October people, not only soldiers, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=641.5999999999999s)]
*  everybody in Israel might have this feeling that they want revenge. Maybe it wore down by now but [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=646.64s)]
*  even I maybe felt it to a certain extent, you know. But what's sad and what's different these days [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=652.8s)]
*  is that this kind of feeling and this desire for revenge and this idea that we don't need to make [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=659.84s)]
*  a difference between Hamas operatives and civilians isn't just something that you feel inside and you [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=666.8000000000001s)]
*  kind of want to feel and you might feel ashamed of it. It's completely normalized by the highest [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=675.52s)]
*  ranks not only in government which is already really fucked up but they're, I guess, trying to [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=680.48s)]
*  be populist and to ride this wave of hate but also you can see this from within higher ranks [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=687.44s)]
*  in the army which is really frightening and I can definitely see how certain statements that used to [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=694.8800000000001s)]
*  be more considered kind of things that you're not supposed to say like we need to flatten out Gaza, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=703.9200000000001s)]
*  there shouldn't be anybody left there after we finish this war or it's about time we finish [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=710.4000000000001s)]
*  them once and for all. All kinds of statements like that have become something that are quite normal [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=716.48s)]
*  around me sadly and they become normalized because of our leaders first of all. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=723.52s)]
*  When you saw those images, as we've all seen, images, video footage of [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=730.08s)]
*  Palestinian men stripped and nearly naked down to their underpants and paraded in front of cameras, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=736.4s)]
*  I mean a former British soldier made the point that removing clothes of people isn't in itself [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=743.8399999999999s)]
*  something which you wouldn't see in a military operation, check for suicide belts, belts, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=750.4s)]
*  things like that, but doing mass arrests where people are stripped and then paraded in front of [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=753.92s)]
*  cameras obviously contravenes the Geneva Conventions, it's very clear that you can't [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=760.0s)]
*  do that according to international law. But what's your sense of when you saw those images and footage [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=764.4s)]
*  there are also allegations that were obviously taken away and allegations of torture that kind [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=769.6800000000001s)]
*  of thing. What's your sense of what's happening there, what's how it's been justified and what [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=773.36s)]
*  the purpose is? Yeah my sense is first of all there's no doubt that many people in Gaza are [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=778.16s)]
*  part of Hamas and they might even participate in what happened on the 7th of October. It's not like [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=786.08s)]
*  I know who is a terrorist and who isn't, I can't come here and tell you oh I know all of these [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=792.0s)]
*  people are innocent and none of them have done anything on the 7th, but I don't see any security, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=796.08s)]
*  military logic behind parading people nakedly in front of cameras, like naked people in front of [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=804.8000000000001s)]
*  cameras in such a humiliating way. One thing that it makes me think is that this can only help Hamas [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=813.2800000000001s)]
*  more gain power because they have maybe an ideology in which they say all Zionists, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=820.72s)]
*  all Israelis, all Jews are kind of monsters that it's impossible to speak with in any kind of [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=828.48s)]
*  dialogue and we must fight and because we have no other option so we have no one to speak with. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=834.48s)]
*  And images like that really serve I think that narrative on Hamas's side. But what I think they [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=841.36s)]
*  do and their purpose is actually it might be twofold. It might be one idea would be [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=846.8s)]
*  and I think this is kind of something you hear a lot and it's kind of like this, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=854.8s)]
*  it's a bit orientalist logic about the Middle East is that we need to talk to them in their [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=861.04s)]
*  language. We need to stop being so humane as if we're like the most humane nation in all of history [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=866.7199999999999s)]
*  and we need to start understanding that we're in the jungle and we need to play according to the [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=873.76s)]
*  jungle rules. So maybe something like that according to that logic is kind of showing them oh you mess [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=878.08s)]
*  with us, you really messed up this time which has been proven for years, for whenever I was alive at [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=884.0s)]
*  least, that this never caused any more safety or security only caused the opposite. It caused more [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=891.28s)]
*  escalation and more violence and more feeling that there's no safety. So I don't see how that logic [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=897.36s)]
*  worked so far if we're speaking security only from security eyes. But what I think the more, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=902.8s)]
*  the deeper and maybe the real reason for these images is to serve the Israeli society. I think [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=909.5999999999999s)]
*  Israeli society needs to feel like we got back at them, that we're causing them pain, that we're [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=915.4399999999999s)]
*  inflicting damage on them, that we're maybe even humiliating them. I'm not saying everybody but I [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=920.9599999999999s)]
*  think that these kinds of images serve that desire for sure and I think there is, to actually [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=927.28s)]
*  do what the army or the country's leaders say they're going to do, the goals are which is to [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=938.4s)]
*  destroy Hamas and eliminate them. It seems like quite, I don't know if impossible but it's quite [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=946.4s)]
*  a really difficult mission that will include maybe losing the legitimacy internationally which [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=956.4s)]
*  we already see and maybe losing a lot of lives and soldiers and maybe never really managing to [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=963.84s)]
*  completely fulfill that mission that seems kind of impossible maybe to a certain extent. So I think [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=970.88s)]
*  that our leaders and the leadership are searching for victory images and I think that actions like [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=977.9200000000001s)]
*  these like humiliating photos and destructions of huge structures like universities and mosques and [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=988.32s)]
*  these kinds of videos are there to serve that kind of desire for a victory image that an Israeli can [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=996.1600000000001s)]
*  sit in their home and watch TV or be on the internet and feel like this desire for a victory [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1003.2s)]
*  image has been fulfilled but I think that's fake. It's a fake victory. It's a very shallow victory [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1012.72s)]
*  because where is it leading us? I don't think it's leading us anywhere and I think it's also [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1022.96s)]
*  quite shameful that this is where we've gotten to, that we find joy and we find satisfaction [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1028.4s)]
*  in the humiliation of others and destruction of others. Just a couple of other things. This is [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1037.52s)]
*  really fascinating by the way. In terms of the death toll, I mean there's been attempts to [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1045.3600000000001s)]
*  muddy the waters in terms of what the actual death toll is and because their health ministries are [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1051.8400000000001s)]
*  run by Hamas but in previous conflicts the final death toll issued by the health ministries being [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1055.44s)]
*  validated by Israel and the United Nations and other aid agencies think it's correct. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1061.76s)]
*  When Biden questioned the death toll they released names, ages and also Israel approved ID's because [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1068.0800000000002s)]
*  the civil registry is still run by Israel. So we know it's accurate and in fact excludes people [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1073.8400000000001s)]
*  buried under the rubble so actually it's an underestimate. So it's about 20 000. I mean [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1081.1200000000001s)]
*  that's a credible estimate. It's about 1% of the population and you keep seeing, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1084.8000000000002s)]
*  I've never seen anything like it, you log on to Twitter and you read of a journalist, a UN [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1091.1200000000001s)]
*  aid worker and it just says they've been killed but then it says 23 members of their family have [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1095.44s)]
*  also been killed. I've never seen anything like that in my life. What does that tell us about the [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1101.3600000000001s)]
*  military operation? Like what is actually happening? How that, because it is it is an [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1108.0s)]
*  extremely rare, the Israeli newspaper did a study of this and you know there aren't really precedents [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1114.0s)]
*  for that kind of bombing campaign in a very small area of space obviously. What's your sense of [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1119.44s)]
*  what's happened to the dynamics of the military campaign? Well it's hard to say exactly what's [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1123.76s)]
*  going on in the highest rooms but I doubt that there's someone who's saying oh let's you know [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1129.36s)]
*  here's a bunch of civilians have done nothing so let's just kill them because if that would be the [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1136.16s)]
*  case we could have maybe killed more you know but that doesn't, that the fact that that isn't how it [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1141.0400000000002s)]
*  works doesn't mean that it's completely different. So I think the way from what I know and what I've [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1148.4s)]
*  studied and heard as a researcher in Breaking the Silence is that you have something called [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1157.52s)]
*  collateral damage which means you have a military aim target and then according to how important [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1165.84s)]
*  that target is then you allow yourself more collateral damage which means innocent people [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1173.9199999999998s)]
*  dying and maybe destruction of civilian infrastructure. And when we see so many [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1184.24s)]
*  civilians are uninvolved what we call the IDF called uninvolved that's I think it has to do with [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1192.0s)]
*  a growing tolerance towards collateral damage. So if you have so that means you have more targets [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1198.88s)]
*  the targets might be less important and your collateral damage that you allow around it which [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1211.44s)]
*  basically means innocent people dying becomes higher. Every war, every round of violence in Gaza [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1217.12s)]
*  this kind of equation changes in which the target we're more liberal I think with the way we [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1225.52s)]
*  allow collateral damage and then you have to think about what it means a military target. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1233.12s)]
*  If there is a Hamas member who was verified to be in a certain building I don't know exactly because [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1240.0s)]
*  I'm not the one choosing the targets but that might make the whole building become a target [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1245.84s)]
*  right. So we need to think about what that means from the Israeli side if we would think it would [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1251.1999999999998s)]
*  be justified let's say if a high-ranked Israeli officer or just an Israeli soldier walked into [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1256.72s)]
*  an apartment one time and had dinner or lived in a building does that mean that everybody around [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1262.8s)]
*  becomes a legitimate target and I think as we dominate Palestinians more especially in this [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1269.28s)]
*  way in which we do it in Gaza I think as a people we become as a society we become much more [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1276.96s)]
*  tolerant to deaths of civilians and it's coming to a point right now where we what we talked about [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1283.52s)]
*  before where people actually claim that there is no such thing as an innocent person in Gaza. This [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1290.24s)]
*  is a gradual process that's reaching a peak I hope because if this isn't the peak then I don't [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1297.04s)]
*  want to know what the peak is. Just finally kind of links to that and just people might know actually [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1303.28s)]
*  I interviewed Yuval Abraham he's a brilliant Israeli investigative journalist for the Israeli [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1308.48s)]
*  Palestinian publication plus 972 magazine who went through many of the themes you just very [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1312.32s)]
*  articulately spoke about. Just finally yeah dehumanization now I mean firstly look 7th [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1317.28s)]
*  of October is a huge trauma in Israeli society it's traumatized Israeli society quite understandably [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1321.68s)]
*  so obviously well we would agree there was much there's a there's a that this didn't begin on [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1327.28s)]
*  7th of October it goes back many many decades the context of occupation of siege and and so on [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1334.72s)]
*  and but the point I was just that point about dehumanization and what occupations do to [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1341.92s)]
*  occupiers and we were talking just before I put the video on about the experience of [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1348.32s)]
*  for example Britain and Ireland and the Irish were dehumanized in a in a way which I think lots [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1354.96s)]
*  of people who grew up in the 90s onwards don't actually often understand because Irish [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1361.44s)]
*  culturally became sexy you know Irish that kind of thing it's something kind of like that was [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1367.6s)]
*  not how Irish people were generally treated they were treated off they were portrayed as subhuman [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1373.1200000000001s)]
*  as innately brutish as as violent as uncivilized and that was a you know there was a famous [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1378.08s)]
*  wave of something this up in terms of even in the 1950s 60s of signs which would say no blacks no [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1386.4799999999998s)]
*  dogs no Irish and I'm just interested because there was nothing unique in that sense about this [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1392.8s)]
*  but I'm just interested in that dehumanization what how many Israeli citizens have come to see [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1398.8799999999999s)]
*  Palestinians and whether that can ever shift and and how because that level of dehumanization is [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1406.16s)]
*  required to sustain this level of oppression and occupation because if you as you said when you [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1413.76s)]
*  start seeing those family photos and you see people as human beings kids all the rest of it [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1420.5600000000002s)]
*  who have hopes and dreams and fears and who love and are loved it becomes a lot harder to do [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1425.3600000000001s)]
*  terrible things to them so I'm just wondering about that dehumanization and and how you [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1432.16s)]
*  shamed it that was a very long question I do apologize yeah yeah yeah yeah um you know when [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1436.48s)]
*  I was a soldier in the Jenin area guarding the fence we were patrolling the fence between the [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1441.0400000000002s)]
*  Jenin area and Israel and it's this like what we call a smart fence which when someone touches it [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1450.88s)]
*  then you get an indication and then you go there with your jeep and one time we had this and there [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1458.08s)]
*  were two kids who were got to be from my memory at least like maximum eight maybe seven eight-year-olds [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1464.72s)]
*  and they touched the fence I don't know what they were doing there but our commander our officer he [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1472.72s)]
*  had this idea that they were maybe sent to touch the fence in order to test how fast it takes us [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1477.84s)]
*  to get to that point and therefore in order to kind of ruin their idea or their scheme we will [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1485.04s)]
*  arrest these kids so they know not to try to think about doing anything funny you know so basically [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1494.8799999999999s)]
*  we had a reason why to arrest these kids for touching the fence and I was sent to arrest [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1501.6s)]
*  these two kids and put them in the military jeep and drive up to our base and put them in this little [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1507.12s)]
*  room and it made sense for a second and then I was holding these two kids brothers maybe or friends [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1512.8s)]
*  and closing the jeep and they were crying terrified holding each other and they were looking at me and [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1522.72s)]
*  they were terrified for me you know and I'm a good guy why would anybody be so terrified for me a [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1528.96s)]
*  seven-year-old and then I realized I'm kidnapping these kids you know there was some kind of military [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1534.6399999999999s)]
*  logic for a second there why and and and then you see what you're doing and then as you said [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1540.96s)]
*  when you're at that point when you're armed and you're arresting these little kids um and you [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1550.32s)]
*  you don't want to feel nobody wants to feel like you're doing something bad so dehumanization in [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1559.68s)]
*  that moment could be really helpful you know so generally speaking as you said I think that [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1564.72s)]
*  the more you need to to control other people and controlling them through intimidation [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1570.96s)]
*  through putting their heads down through humiliation yeah you need to also it's [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1578.24s)]
*  it's more difficult to do that if you see their humanity for sure and I think this war really [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1583.6000000000001s)]
*  crystallized something for me and I think it might be true for both both sides not that I can speak [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1590.96s)]
*  about the other side because I'm not Palestinian but I think that there's this people this narrative [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1595.84s)]
*  of there it's either us or them there's no space for both of us on this land [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1603.84s)]
*  and there are a lot of people who believe that between the river and the sea and it goes to our [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1609.36s)]
*  government and actually many of people in the opposition but it's also true to the Hamas and [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1615.6799999999998s)]
*  the kind of ideology they serve and once you believe that there's no space for both people [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1620.32s)]
*  to live peacefully in the land or at all then you're you have to turn to dehumanization [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1626.6399999999999s)]
*  because it either us or them means that one of us needs to be either exterminated or transferred [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1633.76s)]
*  out and to accept that idea I think it's quite difficult so I think again dehumanization is [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1641.4399999999998s)]
*  really helpful for holding on to that narrative which is probably the majority of Israelis [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1649.92s)]
*  I hope not I hope I'm wrong and I think this is also what has been crystallized for me in these [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1658.48s)]
*  days as an activist is that we have to crack that narrative it seems so simple and maybe even like [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1664.8000000000002s)]
*  kumbaya ish like oh there's place for both nations on this land but I believe that the the narrative [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1671.92s)]
*  is so important because it also serves Israeli violence and continuing the war because if there's [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1679.6s)]
*  really no space for both of us and it's it's either Palestinians who can live on this land [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1687.76s)]
*  or Israelis then this pushes Israelis to this corner where they feel more justified with their [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1693.28s)]
*  actions and obviously the opposite is true too so if you only believe that it's either us or them [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1699.6s)]
*  then war is the only option it's very it's very fertile land for war and dehumanization so I [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1712.6399999999999s)]
*  believe that that is kind of something that has been that we need to put our our focus on right now [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1719.52s)]
*  I think it was a very thought-provoking way to end it Ariel that was that was absolutely fascinating [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1725.92s)]
*  and full of insight but also humanity which I'm always a big fan of humane insights into the [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1731.2s)]
*  horrors in which we live in and if there were more of it we would not live in the world in which we [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1738.4s)]
*  live so please like and subscribe and do share this video but a special thanks to Ariel for his [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KKHIS9D7I&t=1744.48s)]
