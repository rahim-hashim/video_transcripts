# Outrage As Democrats BLOCK Palestinian Speakers - w. Tariq Habash
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [August 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C8OVV0eWv0)
*  So the Democratic National Convention is of course taking place in Chicago, months before
*  the presidential election, the nominee of course Kamala Harris. The Democrats at the moment are
*  refusing, at the time we're broadcasting or doing this interview, to put a Palestinian
*  speaker on the stage. Now this is something which is under growing pressure over. Now there's no
*  better person to speak to about this and just generally what's happening at the convention and
*  the Democrats on this issue than Tarek Habash, who was the first political appointee of the
*  Biden administration to resign over Israel's genocidal onslaught. And I should also mention
*  he is Palestinian-American, which is more than relevant given what we're talking about. Hey,
*  Tarek, how are you doing? Hey Owen, great to be here. Could you just explain, I mean, refusing
*  to have a Palestinian speaker. We had two parents of an Israeli hostage and their pain was on stage,
*  their suffering. And they mentioned in that, you know, the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza,
*  but no Palestinian on the stage to talk about that. What, just tell us about that and what that
*  actually represents. Yeah, I mean, it represents the Democratic Party and its continuation of
*  erasing the Palestinian identity from the moment, from the party, from American society. There are
*  so many Palestinian-Americans who have felt so much pain, indescribable pain, every single day
*  for the last 10 months. And I think likewise, there are many Israelis and American Jews and
*  really just Americans across the country who have felt pain for the Israeli families who have
*  suffered as well. And I don't think that anyone is upset that Israeli families who had an opportunity
*  to express that pain yesterday. I think it's just the reality that Palestinians continue to be the
*  ones that have to sacrifice, who continue to be dehumanized, who continue to be erased by this
*  political party, by this political infrastructure in the United States, whether Democrat or Republican
*  on one hand, you have a Republican nominee who calls Palestinians, uses the term Palestinian as
*  a slur. On the other hand, you have a Democratic Party that's supposed to be a big tent that's
*  supposed to represent every facet of America that continuously refuses to acknowledge the harm that
*  has befallen the Palestinian people because of American weapons, because of American tax dollars,
*  because of this administration's refusal to change course, to change policy, to enforce our own laws.
*  It's not a big ask. Let's enforce our own laws when it comes to the weapons that we are providing
*  to an ally. Let's make sure that these weapons are not used for war crimes. Let's make sure that
*  we're protecting civilian life. We're not even doing that. It's a bare minimum.
*  I mean, you resigned at the beginning of this year, and clearly Joe Biden's administration,
*  up to his neck, arming, supporting aid, political diplomatic support. Do you think there's been any
*  tangible progress now he's gone with Kamala Harris? What do you think when people say,
*  or do you think there's a bit of a, this is all a bit of a wing and a prayer, people just
*  hoping something might turn up under her presidency rather than something substantive?
*  I mean, listen, Joe Biden ideologically has a problem with being able to even show any empathy
*  toward Palestinians. So the fact that the candidate that's running for office is anyone other than Joe
*  Biden is a huge success. I don't want to discount that at all, but we're 10 months into a genocide,
*  10 months plus. We continue to send weapons unconditionally to an Israeli government that
*  has proven that they are not interested in returning Israeli or Palestinian hostages,
*  that they are interested in continuing the genocide, continuing the starvation of millions
*  of Palestinians, continuing the ethnic cleansing. And we are okay with that. And that's unfortunately,
*  it's not enough just to have a change in tone to be more humanizing of Palestinians, which I think
*  even just the events of the last week come call into question whether the democratic party is
*  actually humanizing Palestinians. But the reality is we need real substantive policy action. We need
*  to enforce our own laws. We need to actually take steps to protect Palestinian lives right now,
*  not in six months, not in three months right now. I mean, just be a bit brutal. I mean, it's easy for
*  me to say this, although the consequences of the US presidential election, we all suffer the
*  consequences. This is the last, it's the only hegemon on the planet. So we also have the
*  consequences. I understand the desperation to stop Trump, but do you think some US progressives who've
*  genuinely shown distress about the genocidal onslaught on Gaza have become, start to behave a
*  bit like this is all a bit of an inconvenience? Yeah, they're desperate to get rid of Trump.
*  That's become the overriding priority. And the issue of Gaza, of Palestine is just being relegated
*  by a lot of people. Yeah. And I think it's short-sighted. I think what we know is that
*  genocide is one of the worst things that could happen to any society. And I think when you
*  justify or you excuse it, even because there are other existential risks, you create the likelihood
*  and the possibility that that genocide could extend beyond the region that it is facing.
*  And you're essentially saying if it is okay to happen to Palestinians in Palestine and Gaza
*  right now, who's to say that it won't happen to some other community, maybe even here in
*  the United States? And that doesn't only become a risk if it's Donald Trump, that becomes a risk
*  when you normalize it. Just a couple of other things, because I know you're speaking. Do you
*  think, I mean, in terms of at the moment, there are certain states like Michigan and elsewhere,
*  where there are, we don't know, Trump has a good chance of winning. It depends actually on people
*  turning out in the Democratic coalition, including Palestinian Americans, including
*  Muslim Americans, including younger progressives and progressives in general who just don't like
*  genocide. Do you think, what do you think about the prospects, given where the Democrats are
*  currently at, of many of those simply just whatever being told, screamed, you've got to do this
*  because of Trump. It doesn't matter how much they get that yelled at, they just won't be able to
*  bring themselves to vote for the Democrats. What do you think? Where are we at with that?
*  I think it's a real risk. And I think one of the reasons why the uncommitted movement
*  is so important right now is because they're actually trying to do Democrats a favor. It's
*  not only that they are horrified by what's happening, but they also know that Democrats
*  can be better and should be better, particularly on human rights. It's consistent with the
*  Democratic Party's vision for America, consistent with the Democratic Party's vision for the world.
*  And there are people who would like to support Kamala Harris and a Democrat, but there are real
*  dangers if there is not an effort to actually show that Democrats are going to be any different
*  moving forward. And when it actually comes to policy, when it comes to substance, when it comes
*  to voters, we know based on data, the Institute for Middle East Understanding just came out with
*  new polls in battleground states, in Georgia, in Pennsylvania, in Wisconsin, other states.
*  It's not just Michigan. It's not just Arabs. It's not just Palestinian Americans.
*  It is multiracial. It's multiethnic. It's multigenerational. There is a coalition of
*  people who believe that this issue defines the future of America, not just foreign policy-wise,
*  not just on a global stage, but domestically as well. And there are a lot of people who would
*  very clearly have a much stronger ability to support a Democratic candidate like Kamala Harris
*  in November if policy changed, if we used American leverage to achieve a permanent and
*  lasting ceasefire. And that means, unfortunately, for Americans as hard as it might be enforcing
*  our laws and preventing the continuation of weapons to flow to an Israeli government that
*  continues to commit genocide. And just very finally, Gideon Levy, the very courageous
*  Israeli journalist I've interviewed him, he doesn't have much hope, I have to say,
*  for Israel at the moment. His hope, he thinks, is in the US with public opinion shifting.
*  It used to be the case that just criticizing Israel on American soil, he was pretty much
*  foreboding, very difficult. That's changed. Polling shows more Americans than not think
*  genocide has been committed. That's a huge shift. Most oppose the military onslaught,
*  which is one euphemistic way of putting it. Do you think public attitudes have now shifted
*  and are shifting to the extent where a permanent shift is plausible, that Israel won't be able to
*  just get loads of weapons, aid and support whilst it bears out wishes?
*  Yes, absolutely. And I actually think that American politicians are behind American public
*  opinion. They have not actually realized how much American public opinion has shifted.
*  We've seen it at the convention. Anytime someone mentions Gaza, mentions ceasefire, mentions
*  Palestinians, there are loud applause. Because even people in the Democratic base recognize the
*  importance of this issue, recognize the importance of Democrats to be right on this. It's not just the
*  ceasefire coalition, it's everyone. It's a big tent issue. We all have to be on the right side
*  of this. And I think that the political incentives need to also shift because our politicians are
*  moving too slowly and it's costing support. It's fragmenting the base. It's fragmenting American
*  society. It's been a massive honor. It's very difficult, I have to say. I can't imagine what
*  it's like to witness the genocide taking place whilst also having to be gaslit, the erasure,
*  just the complete open contempt for the value of Palestinian life expressed,
*  including by people who call themselves progressive, nauseating stuff. For those
*  watching, just like, subscribe, leave your comments as ever. But share, share this video,
*  get Tarek's voice out. But Tarek, honestly, what an honor. Lovely to speak to you.
*  Thanks so much, Owen.
