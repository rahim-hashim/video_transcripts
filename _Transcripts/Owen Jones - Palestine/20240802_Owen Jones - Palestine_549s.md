# Israeli Soldier BOASTS Of War Crimes - They Couldn't Be Prouder Of Genocide
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [August 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GdleRzXxFU)
*  One of the most striking features of Israel's ongoing genocide in Gaza is just how unsubtle
*  its perpetrators have been. They have not sought to cover up their intent, they have
*  loudly and proudly boasted to the world their intent, leaving no room for misinterpretation.
*  From the Prime Minister to his government, other politicians to army officers, media
*  outlets to journalists, to soldiers on the ground. Now a loud message has been broadcast
*  to the world, which we have heard that the Israeli state and much of society in the grip
*  of genocidal mania believes that Palestinians collectively are a problem as far as they're
*  concerned. Their very existence a problem. This mentality underpins Israel's military
*  onslaught against and indeed the siege of Gaza. Now here is one example I'm going
*  to just show you which you know I'd say I will say it should be shocking. It's really
*  important to always be shocked. You know all the way through this horror I try to say on
*  a daily basis never never stop being shocked. Never treat this as normal. Always feel that
*  horror that this is actually happening. Never let it go away. So this example an Israeli
*  soldier named Devir Luger he tweeted the following, brace yourself, we left Gaza after two months
*  of being in reserve. The heat was unbearable and the feeling is that we could have done
*  more. The destruction that exists in Gaza gives me a good feeling. Gaza is in a state of
*  destruction. Lots of buildings that no longer exist in the landscape. The machine of destruction
*  must continue to work so that it is clear that they have nowhere to return. Despair as a work
*  plan. Accompanying this tweet was a video of that total destruction of Gaza.
*  It's difficult isn't it to find the words. It's difficult. Such a sick twisted sick twisted
*  thing to write. Full of sadism relishing in cruelty relishing in human suffering.
*  Relishing in the horror being inflicted on other human beings. He doesn't see them as humans that's
*  the problem. What he wrote should be regarded as a confession of grave grave war crimes. The words
*  themselves are reminiscent of course of the sorts of words which have always accompanied the worst
*  atrocities committed in human history. He relishes the total destruction of Gaza and the suffering of
*  its people. He makes it clear that there is a deliberate mass destruction of civilian
*  infrastructure and that this mass destruction should continue so that the Palestinian people
*  can no longer live in Gaza. Despair as a work plan as he puts it. The words are indicative of
*  the total dehumanization of the Palestinian people. There is no pretense there that he
*  considers Palestinians to be humans with lives of any worth. Indeed here is an example of
*  genocidal mentality which believes that the civilian population the Palestinian people
*  must either leave or be killed. Now to be clear this guy is not some random Israeli soldier. It's
*  really important to just make that very clear. He's the former editor at Israel's channel 14 news
*  channel which is extremely close to the government and a spokesperson of Avi Haiburan an Israeli
*  politician who belongs to the ruling Likud party of which of course Benjamin Netanyahu is leader
*  and prime minister. As one brilliant Israeli activist Nadav Finbuk put it, thanks for posting
*  the video. Take into account that we have documented you with your full name. Everything is
*  published and will reach the hands of the international law authorities. If I were you
*  I would start dreading getting on a flight. Indeed please do circulate the name of Devir Luger.
*  Don't forget it. Let's make an example. Let's get that name out there. Let's make sure that if
*  he ever touches the ground of whatever country you're in he is arrested. We brought this example to
*  the attention of Tayyab Ali, a solicitor belonging to the International Centre of Justice for
*  Palestinians who is leading legal attempts to prosecute politicians but also for example
*  soldiers who commit war crimes. Now there are so many examples I realize of these soldiers. Indeed
*  IDF soldiers who have variously used TikTok and Twitter to boast about and publicise their war
*  crimes. This is because of impunity and not irrational belief that the Israeli state can
*  do exactly what it wants with no consequences. Well I firmly believe that impunity is falling
*  apart in real time. There was another response however from a purported Israeli peace activist,
*  I won't name and shame him but it depressed me almost as much as the original tweet. He wrote
*  in response to the sickening diatribe, desperation is the most dangerous weapon that Hamas has.
*  I mean my response is are you serious? Is this really an appropriate response to confessions of
*  war crimes, of genocidal mentality, of relishing and suffering, mass destruction, death, that your
*  chosen criteria about whether this is good or bad is whether or not it will bolster the hated enemy.
*  Let's be clear, there is no question Hamas committed war crimes on the 7th of October,
*  I've always been clear about that. Let me also be clear, the war crimes of Israel are much much
*  much worse, much graver, much more obscene. I mean anyone who denies that is an atrocity denier.
*  You are denying the mass slaughter of tens of thousands of people and the heinous crimes
*  committed against Palestinians every single day. Arguing from a position of moral superiority after
*  all of that, what do you even say? Is that really the hill you're going to die on?
*  But there's no acceptance, there's no acceptance of the humanity of the Palestinian people.
*  From this, a supposed Israeli progressive, none at all, that's what's depressing. When I said it
*  wasn't appropriate to him, he responded it's not what's appropriate, inappropriate, it's about where
*  that has the potential to be effective. Doesn't all of your strategies work very well mate, does it?
*  If accepting dehumanisation as a premise is your strategy, doesn't seem to have worked.
*  Your fellow citizens are currently rioting in the streets in support of rape. That's where
*  we're currently at. The biggest unrest we've seen by Israeli citizens since this began is not against
*  genocide, it's against an attempt to stop, as I'll mention further, soldiers raping Palestinians.
*  I mean if even opponents of this onslaught are willing to go along with ensuring there's no
*  discussion of the humanity of those being butchered by the tens of thousands, what is the point?
*  Now it's notable, as I've said, there were riots this week after a Palestinian detainee was gang
*  raped and there was an attempt to arrest the soldiers responsible, even though there has been
*  mass torture and abuse and rape of Palestinians for months and months and months, indeed long
*  predating 7th October. So citizens rioted, including government ministers, in support of
*  the right to rape Palestinian detainees. Why the sudden attempt at an arrest? Now it is notable
*  that one of the soldiers suspected of this torture said his interrogation by the military police was
*  a sham. He said, you feel they want to thank you, there were days when they applauded us.
*  Yeah, good independent judiciary there. A good clue was offered by an Israeli doctor who treated
*  the tortured Palestinian detainee which sparked all of this. He said firstly, if the state and
*  Knesset members think there's no limit to how much you can abuse prisoners, they should kill
*  themselves like the Nazis did. Oof, punchy. But he also said, if they maintain a hospital only for
*  the sake of defending ourselves at the International Criminal Court of The Hague, that's no good.
*  That's important. That is important. What's he saying there? Well the point here is the
*  ICC's mandate is based on what's called complementarity, that it will only intervene and
*  issue arrest warrants if it believes the judicial system of the country in question won't have its
*  own credible investigations. So the Israeli state is engaged in this absurd sham to stop further
*  requests for charges being issued by the ICC. They haven't issued charges yet related to torture,
*  but they should do. And these war crimes and the boasting of these war crimes by IDF soldiers is
*  endless. It's a really important point. Here's a video of the IDF blowing up the water reservoir
*  serving Rafa with the music attached by them as they posted it to social media.
*  Now the 1948 Genocide Convention includes in its definition of genocide deliberately
*  inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole
*  or in part. Blowing up water supplies to civilians, well I think that more than qualifies. Some of the
*  worst atrocities it's possible to be committed against human beings, that's what we're witnessing.
*  Backed and legitimised by governments. It's a really important point. This has all been
*  directly facilitated by these people, by our governments, our rulers. Never let them off the
*  hook. The blood is on their hands as well as those of Israel's rulers. Never forget that.
