# Israel Is COVERING UP These Crimes. Here Is The Hideous Truth.
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2gFdIZTNi4)
*  Look at what they've done. As I speak and as you listen, the Israeli state is perpetrating some of
*  the worst atrocities of the 21st century, in an onslaught against Gaza, being tried as an alleged
*  genocide at the International Court of Justice, which has ruled it to be a plausible genocide,
*  and issued several provisional orders for Israel to follow in order to prevent genocide,
*  all of which have been brazenly flouted by Israel. Some of these atrocities, many of these atrocities,
*  are simply hidden. We are relying on the incredible work of the surviving Palestinian
*  journalist of Gaza, the lions of the world press pack, but Israel is responsible for the biggest
*  killing of journalists ever recorded in any conflict, and the remaining courageous journalists
*  have to battle near impossible conditions to report what they can. Foreign journalists have
*  been banned from entering Gaza for a straightforward reason, as the Sky News special correspondent
*  Alex Crawford put it in December, international journalists have been deliberately blocked from
*  entering Gaza by primarily Israel, who doesn't want them seeing the war crimes. As a foreign
*  press association said in a statement this week, the barring of independent press access to a war
*  zone for this long is unprecedented for Israel. It raises questions about what Israel does not
*  want international journalists to see. Well, indeed. Now, so-called Israel defence forces
*  have withdrawn from Karnouness, a city with a pre-war population of around 400,000. It has
*  been devastated, destroyed. Maher Hosseini, an award-winning journalist and human rights activist
*  based in Gaza who has won the prestigious Martin Adler Prize for her work, visited Karnouness after
*  the withdrawal of Israeli forces, and the footage she took shows total and utter devastation, which
*  is beyond description. She writes, not a single home is in bomb, not one building is in scorch,
*  walking through the neighbourhoods you cannot help but sense Israel's palpable desire for revenge
*  against an entire population. Let's listen now to Hind Kowdhury, an immensely courageous
*  Palestinian journalist based in Gaza, as she reports for Al Jazeera.
*  Now, Israeli leaders and officials and media outlets made extremely clear from the start that
*  they intended to impose collective punishment on the Palestinian people and to make Gaza
*  uninhabitable, that Palestinians would be forced to leave or they would die. They've stuck to their
*  word. What Israel has unleashed against Karnouness is indicative of a genocidal campaign, the level
*  of destruction unleashed against a civilian population, civilian infrastructure has few
*  precedents. Let's listen now to Hany Mahmoud for Al Jazeera.
*  This is particularly for remaining family members who were displaced in Rafah city and the central
*  area, rushed to Karnouness city to inspect on their residential homes and residential blocks,
*  and to check on remaining family members that they were trapped inside the city of Karnouness
*  as the Israeli military was operating so aggressively. We're looking at more than 90%
*  of the city have been destroyed completely, utter devastation of not only the residential homes,
*  also the public facilities, the infrastructure, the roads, entire areas have been destroyed
*  beyond recognition. We were told by some people who are residents of the eastern part of Karnouness
*  that they could not recognize the streets to their residential homes. They could not recognize the
*  areas that they have lived in for the past years of their life. The entire city of Karnouness have
*  turned into a maze of rubbles and we're talking about systematic destruction and controlled
*  demolition of homes mainly in the eastern area, but more of it of the public facilities,
*  the infrastructure in central Karnouness at the vicinity of Nasr hospital, all the way to
*  the western part near the evacuations on people. 90% of the city destroyed, as he says, as well as
*  public facilities, infrastructure, roads. Note that the mass destruction of roads, by the way,
*  is one of the many reasons people are starving to death in Gaza because clearly that imposes
*  formidable obstacles, quite literally, to getting aid to those who so desperately need it.
*  Now let's listen to the former head of Israel's Ministry of Strategic Affairs explaining Israel
*  is prepared to accept a ceasefire but then will attack Ratha where most of Gaza's population
*  currently shelters. If there is going to be a possible ceasefire, as you say, if you say that
*  Israel is willing to engage in that and those talks continue, is that offensive on Ratha still
*  planned? We've heard from Mr Netanyahu that it's still going to go ahead despite concerns from
*  allies like the US. Yes, of course, we say this is a ceasefire, this is not the end of the war.
*  Hamas wants to impose on us the end of the war so that they will be able to rule Gaza in the future
*  and carry out more October 7 massacres in the future. We say we can have a ceasefire but we
*  shouldn't finish the job of taking over Gaza and eliminating Hamas over there. That's the
*  difference, that's what keeps the agreement about the deal from happening and we have the commitment
*  to make sure that Hamas doesn't pose any threat in the future to Israel from Gaza. That's what we are
*  committed to and for that to happen we have to take over Ratha to make sure that Hamas cannot
*  bring in weapons from Egypt, to make sure that Hamas cannot regroup. There are a lot of
*  concerns though that this assault on Ratha could destabilize the situation even further
*  and there's real concern about civilians in that area. No, we have prepared, we have prepared and
*  we are preparing more space for civilians to find safer places north of Ratha. We left Hanunas so
*  that people can come back to Hanunas and we are not going to enter Ratha before we take care of
*  the civilian population and make sure they are in safer places. So firstly we can be assured that
*  Ratha will face the sort of total destruction that Khan Yunus has already endured and while I speak
*  we'll show aerial footage from the city of Beit Hunan in northern Gaza Strip to just underline how
*  comprehensively they've destroyed Gaza throughout. Now listen to what he just said, he said that the
*  1.3 million or so people in Ratha, around half of whom are kids, can simply go to Khan Yunus. Well
*  you've just seen what happened to Khan Yunus, 90% of it destroyed, just a load of rubble. What
*  on earth are 1.3 million people going to do there? Do you know what's even more absurd? According to
*  the Israeli media outlet Ynet, after spending months wiping Khan Yunus out, slaughtering so
*  many innocent civilians, as soon as the IDF withdrew, Hamas regained control. Because they cannot
*  defeat Hamas by military means. You cannot defeat an idea. If you unleash barbarism of the
*  unimaginable sort that Israel has unleashed, then you will constantly replenish the ranks of Hamas
*  and indeed other groups. You can wipe thousands of Hamas militants out. But then, just all of us,
*  look at some of those images of dads weeping uncontrollably over the bloodied remains of their
*  children, or those sons sobbing over their slaughtered parents and you are looking in some
*  cases at the next wave of recruits for Hamas. Obviously. The truth is we are only aware of a
*  fraction of the horrors that Israel has unleashed. Now the official death toll is an underestimate,
*  not inflated as apologists for Israel claim. As I'll keep saying, the official figures have been
*  validated in previous Israeli onslaughts by both Israel and the United Nations. In the current
*  horror, international agencies confirm the veracity of the figures. The likes of the Medical
*  Journal Lancet have made it clear these figures are entirely credible and indeed likely conservative.
*  While US officials have done the same, privately we know from leaks, so have Israeli officials as
*  well. For example, to the brilliant Israeli-Palestinian magazine, Plus 972 magazine.
*  Now there's a few reasons why it's an underestimate. Bear in mind that the level of
*  destruction is such that not all killings are reported. For example, when entire groups of
*  people or families are wiped out together and there's no one there to report their deaths.
*  Indeed, the health system in Gaza has been obliterated, which makes reporting deaths
*  extremely difficult. We've seen atrocities, cyber crimes committed by Israel, when you see
*  unarmed civilians being killed and then buried. Those figures, those bodies, not reported,
*  those lives not reported. Crucially, those buried under the rubble are excluded from the official
*  statistics. This is important. The latest estimate of the Civil Defence Service in Gaza is that there
*  were 20,000 Palestinians, 20,000 buried under rubble, 20,000. That may well prove to be an
*  underestimate itself based on what we know, for example, from terrible earthquakes. That brings
*  the violent death toll to approaching 55,000 Palestinians from a pre-war population around
*  2.2 million. We're not including there, for example, those dying of health conditions
*  because of the destruction of the healthcare system in Gaza, which is essentially destroyed.
*  This is the context. The British Foreign Secretary, David Cameron, says that Britain will continue
*  selling arms to Israel while suppressing legal advice to the government, which a senior Tory MP
*  has said makes clear Israel is violating international humanitarian law. Some of the
*  worst crimes of our time. We can't become numb to them. We can't normalise them. We can't just move
*  on. We have to keep talking about this as loud as we can because otherwise Israel will be allowed
*  to get away with one of the most obscene crimes of our time, the Genocidal War against Gaza.
