# Official Gaza Death Toll COMPLETELY WRONG Devastating New Study
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [January 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8)
*  The official death toll in Gaza is wrong, specifically those figures you always hear about from Gaza's Ministry of Health. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=0.0s)]
*  Now, you may have heard this being said quite a lot. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=7.0s)]
*  Those who have justified one of the worst crimes of our age, Israel's genocide or rampage, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=10.0s)]
*  have relentlessly tried to undermine faith in the official death statistics by claiming they're exaggerated, they're inflated, they're invented. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=16.0s)]
*  This atrocity denial is used to sow doubt and confusion, to reduce pressure on Western governments to cease their complicity, to stop arming Israel. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=22.0s)]
*  But it's long been clear that the official figure, now standing at more than 46,000, as hideous as that is, is indeed wrong. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=32.0s)]
*  It is in fact a drastic underestimate. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=40.0s)]
*  That is, the scale of violent deaths caused by Israeli weapons supplied by your governments is much greater than you're actually being told. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=43.0s)]
*  Now, a new peer-reviewed study has been published by The Lancet. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=52.0s)]
*  That is the world's most prestigious medical journal. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=56.0s)]
*  Now, the academics behind it work at world-leading institutions. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=59.0s)]
*  Think Cambridge, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Yale. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=63.0s)]
*  Their method was called three-list capture. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=67.0s)]
*  That is, they cross-reference the official data with the Ministry of Health online survey and social media obituaries. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=69.0s)]
*  What did they find? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=77.0s)]
*  64,260 violent deaths with a 95% confidence interval. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=78.0s)]
*  That is 41% higher than the official statistics. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=84.0s)]
*  And crucially, that was only between the 7th of October 2023 and the 30th of June 2024, nine months. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=89.0s)]
*  So that excludes nearly 200 days worth of death statistics since then. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=97.0s)]
*  And every single day, the Israeli military slaughters large numbers of Palestinians. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=103.0s)]
*  And of deaths with age and sex data available, they found 59% were women, children and the elderly. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=108.0s)]
*  It gets worse. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=118.0s)]
*  This is still likely a drastic underestimate, not just because it's out of date. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=119.0s)]
*  These figures only refer to deaths from traumatic injuries, that is, violent deaths. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=124.0s)]
*  As the researchers say, our findings underestimate the full impact of the military operation in Gaza, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=130.0s)]
*  as they do not account for non-trauma related deaths resulting from health service disruption, food insecurity and inadequate water and sanitation. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=137.0s)]
*  It's worth just absorbing that point for a minute. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=147.0s)]
*  Take the destruction of the hospital system alone. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=149.0s)]
*  As the United Nations report found in October 2024, Israel has perpetrated a concerted policy to destroy Gaza's health care system [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=152.0s)]
*  as part of a broader assault on Gaza, committing war crimes and the crime against humanity of extermination. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=160.0s)]
*  Well, over a thousand health workers have been killed since the genocide began, many others detained, often without charge, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=168.0s)]
*  their loved ones not notified, kidnapped in common parlance. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=174.0s)]
*  All 36 hospitals in Gaza have been attacked. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=178.0s)]
*  Most of them are no longer functional. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=181.0s)]
*  Those remaining only semi-operational, deprived of medicines, water, energy, of course, staff and so on. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=185.0s)]
*  The destruction of a territory's entire health care system, that alone, if that was the only thing happening, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=193.0s)]
*  that is without considering all of the other horrors inflicted on Gaza, that alone imposes a death sentence on countless civilians. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=199.0s)]
*  Think of thousands of cancer patients. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=207.0s)]
*  Think diabetes, think asthma, think heart conditions, think kidney disease. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=209.0s)]
*  Think of the 150,000, 155,000 pregnant women and new mothers of the 130 babies born every day. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=214.0s)]
*  Think of how the destruction of a health care system interacts with depriving a population of their most basic fundamental needs. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=223.0s)]
*  Enough clean water, nutritious food, shelter with protection from the elements, not least in winter. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=231.0s)]
*  Think of how it interacts with overcrowding, with lack of hygiene, with open sewage. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=237.0s)]
*  Think of how it interacts with the deterioration in physical health driven by the acute stress [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=243.0s)]
*  and collapsing mental well-being of having to live under apocalyptic circumstances every single day. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=249.0s)]
*  Consider how these catastrophic circumstances are unimaginable in practice to any of us who does not have to endure them. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=256.0s)]
*  That has now prevailed for 66 weeks, getting worse every day. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=264.0s)]
*  Consider that as well. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=269.0s)]
*  This is why the most accurate measurement of the death toll is excess deaths. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=270.0s)]
*  It is a horrible clinical term. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=276.0s)]
*  That is, you would have to compare the death rate since the 7th of October 2023 with what prevailed before. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=278.0s)]
*  That was already, by the way, profoundly adverse circumstances of Gaza suffering the longest siege of our time. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=284.0s)]
*  But we can look at precedent here. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=292.0s)]
*  From 2015 onwards, Yemen collapsed into brutal civil war, which included western-backed Saudi-led military intervention, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=294.0s)]
*  which was responsible for the violent killings of countless and not counted civilians. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=300.0s)]
*  According to UN estimates in 2020, over the space of five years, that war caused 233,000 deaths. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=306.0s)]
*  But the UN noted that 131,000 of those deaths were from indirect causes, like lack of food, health services and infrastructure. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=313.0s)]
*  In other words, most deaths in Yemen's war were not caused by violence, not directly. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=322.0s)]
*  They were indirectly caused by the damage inflicted on the means of survival. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=327.0s)]
*  Indeed, the horrors in Yemen offer us some brutal context for the scale of catastrophe imposed on the people of Gaza. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=333.0s)]
*  You often get, and these people, I'm just going to say it, they're very sick. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=340.0s)]
*  They make me nauseous. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=344.0s)]
*  Apologists for Israel's genocide play a truly disgusting game, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=345.0s)]
*  where they discover the horrors of Yemen for one reason and one reason alone to undermine caring about the slaughter of Palestinians. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=349.0s)]
*  They just point to the suffering of the people of Yemen, not because they care. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=356.0s)]
*  They absolutely do not. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=361.0s)]
*  They think the suffering suffered, the misery that Yemenis have gone through, the death, the maiming. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=362.0s)]
*  The hardship that can be used to undermine the suffering of the Palestinians. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=369.0s)]
*  They say, why are you talking about Yemen? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=377.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, look, personally, I've written column after column after column. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=379.0s)]
*  I even recorded a documentary about it in a Yemeni refugee camp. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=383.0s)]
*  Hey, it's OK. It's OK. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=390.0s)]
*  It's OK. It's OK. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=392.0s)]
*  Yemen is right there. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=394.0s)]
*  Even if I go to the end of the world, I won't be able to return to Yemen. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=398.0s)]
*  I want to be destroyed like the people of Saudi Arabia, Iran. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=402.0s)]
*  Let's stop. Let's stop. Let's stop. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=409.0s)]
*  I can't even begin to imagine what someone that, you know, for someone that age to go through that amount of cruelty is just pretty difficult to understand and appreciate. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=411.0s)]
*  So I'm certainly not someone who would ever belittle the horrors of Yemen. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=431.0s)]
*  I remember I went to this refugee camp and I met little kids and they drew pictures like kids often do. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=435.0s)]
*  But the pictures they were drawing were not of cute animals and kids playing on swings. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=440.0s)]
*  They were of buildings on fire and corpses, bodies, lying in their own blood. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=445.0s)]
*  I know the horrors of Yemen are shocking in their own right. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=453.0s)]
*  And it is not to belittle what Yemen has gone through to point out that Gaza's fate has been much, much worse. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=456.0s)]
*  It's simply to state the gravity of what Gaza has gone through. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=461.0s)]
*  In Yemen, which was the world's worst humanitarian crisis, those 233 deaths were over the course of half a decade. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=465.0s)]
*  To compare like and like, the violent deaths were an estimated 102,000 over five years. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=472.0s)]
*  The estimated violent deaths in Gaza are 62,260 violent deaths over the space of nine months. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=479.0s)]
*  The absolute, the absolute numbers there in terms of an annual rate is much worse in Gaza. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=487.0s)]
*  But it gets so much more disturbing. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=493.0s)]
*  The pre-war population of Yemen was about 30 million. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=495.0s)]
*  The pre-war population of Gaza between 2.2 million and 2.3 million, much, much lower. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=498.0s)]
*  Way under 10% of the population. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=505.0s)]
*  So just going on the direct violent deaths, the rate of killing in Gaza is so much higher. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=508.0s)]
*  If you went by the official death toll of Gaza, which is clearly a dramatic underestimate as violent deaths, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=514.0s)]
*  that means around 2% of Gaza or one in 50 Palestinians have suffered violent deaths since the 7th of October 2023. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=520.0s)]
*  If you go by the more accurate figures of the Lancet study, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=527.0s)]
*  around 3% of Gaza's population suffered violent deaths in the first nine months, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=531.0s)]
*  which is around one in every 34 people living in Gaza being violently killed in the time it takes to conceive and deliver a baby. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=536.0s)]
*  That's without having any idea, any proper, accurate idea about the number of indirect deaths, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=544.0s)]
*  which we know from Yemen were significantly higher than the direct deaths. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=551.0s)]
*  And Yemen as a whole did not suffer the total level of destruction that Gaza is. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=556.0s)]
*  Sort of a terrible destruction. I'm going to deny that. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=561.0s)]
*  Whole levels of destruction. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=563.0s)]
*  But not apocalyptic like Gaza. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=565.0s)]
*  And it should be noted that there were multiple parties guilty of the killings in Yemen. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=568.0s)]
*  The Saudi led coalition, obviously a very big contributor, but not the only one. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=573.0s)]
*  And in Gaza, it's the Israeli state responsible for the mass slaughter. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=578.0s)]
*  That's why a study by Israeli newspaper, Haaretz, all the way back in August, found that Gaza was Gaza's so-called conflict. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=582.0s)]
*  And I say so-called conflict because it's too asymmetrical to call a conflict. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=591.0s)]
*  But for want of a better term, they found it was one of the bloodiest the 21st century. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=595.0s)]
*  No, they use the official death toll. That is the underestimate. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=600.0s)]
*  And they found that, for example, 405,000 were killed in Syria's civil war over the course of 13 years, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=603.0s)]
*  around 2% of the population. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=610.0s)]
*  They noted that was the same proportion as Gaza in the space of 10 months. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=612.0s)]
*  They note, looking at Ukraine, hideous numbers. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=616.0s)]
*  But they know a much smaller proportion over a longer time period. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=619.0s)]
*  And indeed, despite Putin's undeniable war crimes, a large majority of those killed there are soldiers [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=622.0s)]
*  who are what is a meat grinder. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=628.0s)]
*  The Israeli state will clearly go to great lengths to prevent the world from ever knowing what it has done properly, that is, to Gaza. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=629.0s)]
*  We rely on the work of the lions of the world's press pack, the journalists of Gaza, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=636.0s)]
*  who have suffered the biggest slaughter of media workers in human history, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=641.0s)]
*  as they desperately try every day to show the world the scale of the depravity, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=646.0s)]
*  with no idea what the total death toll is in practice, the actual accurate death toll, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=650.0s)]
*  the direct and indirect deaths, but three other health experts back in July last year estimated 186,000 deaths back then in a letter to the Lancet. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=656.0s)]
*  What we do know is this is the worst rate of killing since the Rwandan genocide of 1994. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=666.0s)]
*  We also know there's no end in sight. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=671.0s)]
*  How long is this going to go on for? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=673.0s)]
*  Even if this slaughter ended like that, ended now, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=675.0s)]
*  the borders of Gaza were completely open to humanitarian aid, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=678.0s)]
*  and there was a massive reconstruction effort that began immediately. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=681.0s)]
*  Even if that happened, a large number of people would still go on to die as a consequence of Israel's onslaught, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=685.0s)]
*  and there was no prospect of any of those things happening. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=691.0s)]
*  There may be some unknowns, but the overall picture is clear. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=695.0s)]
*  There is no excuse for not knowing that a crime of biblical proportions is being facilitated by Western powers. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=699.0s)]
*  No one can claim in all honesty they did not know, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=705.0s)]
*  which is why this evidence is crucial, not just to hold to account Israel's leaders and the Western leaders who aided and abetted them, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=708.0s)]
*  but everyone with power and influence who legitimised this abomination, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=715.0s)]
*  or who did and said little of any worth when they had the opportunity. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=719.0s)]
*  Just finally, you will see a marked increase and improvement in the content being put out. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=724.0s)]
*  That's because I've hired a brilliant video and social media person. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=733.0s)]
*  So these videos, and I've also hired someone, as you can see, to start professionalising the output, make it slicker, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=738.0s)]
*  but to expand on to TikTok, on to Instagram, Facebook, X, to reach more audiences. That's the point. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=745.0s)]
*  And why am I doing that? Because, I'm just going to be brutal, we are heading for fascism. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=753.0s)]
*  And one of the reasons for that is we're losing war on the internet. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=760.0s)]
*  And unless we do something about that, we're in a lot of trouble. Well, we are in trouble. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=764.0s)]
*  I'm going to be honest, we're in more trouble than I think we realise. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=768.0s)]
*  And that's not to disempower people, we've got to do something about it. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=772.0s)]
*  Now, one of the things I want is to try and, which I'll be talking about a lot more, is to try and push the idea of a social media unit, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=775.0s)]
*  which works with other people on the left, other voices that need to be heard to a mass audience, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=781.0s)]
*  which is the reach, particularly people who at the moment are just getting barged constantly with far-right propaganda on social media. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=787.0s)]
*  And that's politicising and radicalising people in the wrong way. We've got to be there. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=792.0s)]
*  But what I'm doing on this channel is now I'm going to start a massive expansion of the content I'm doing on all different channels. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=796.0s)]
*  And I can only do that, of course, because I've hired actual professionals to do it, and I've hired those professionals because of you. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=802.0s)]
*  Because you allow that to happen. So you're going to see a marked improvement and increase in content. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=809.0s)]
*  And that's thanks to your support, which has been on patreon.com. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=815.0s)]
*  If you want to help expand this operation, you're going to see a lot of stuff. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=818.0s)]
*  And yeah, that's that that'll be exciting. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=822.0s)]
*  And then what I'm trying to do is to encourage that across the board with other people, including people who reach people I'm not reaching. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=826.0s)]
*  So we'll come on to that. Otherwise, please press like, leave comments, good for the algorithm, more people watch the video. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=833.0s)]

*  I'll speak to you in a bit. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJgpU77OF8&t=846.0s)]
