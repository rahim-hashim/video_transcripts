# SHOT DEAD In Front Of His Eyes - Devastating Account of Gaza Horror w. James Elder
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [June 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFn_yAb5ac0)
*  Now, I've been speaking to James Elder, the brilliant James Elder from UNICEF, who is
*  in Gaza right now. And obviously, every time I've spoken to him, it's been, well, educational
*  in every sense of the word. It's one of the best communicators we have in terms of someone
*  in Gaza telling the world exactly what's going on, the humanitarian catastrophe that has
*  enveloped the Palestinian people in Gaza. James, it's such a, always a pleasure to speak
*  to you. You're obviously in Ratha. I can hear a drone above you. Can you just explain,
*  just so everyone's aware, what's going on there?
*  The drones haven't stopped. And I mean, I'm very conscious. This is 250 days of this for
*  people. So my last two nights have been sleepless. The first night was a very, very heavy
*  bombardment. I thought I knew what that sounded like. This was someone banging pots next to
*  your head. Last night was a drone. It's pillows over your head. Everything you try. It's a
*  lawnmower right next to you. People here have had 250 days, days of that. The psychological
*  trauma that people have been pushed into, like enforced chaos. So yeah, in the last
*  half hour, Apache helicopters firing, many, many explosions. And then these drones, which
*  are armed drones, but also surveillance and some kind of psychological torture. And again,
*  eight months of this for people. It's, as many people have told me on, it's too much.
*  I have now had these heartbreaking moments of sitting with young people, many of whom
*  have lost loved ones, have lost a brother or sister and have said to me, enough, enough.
*  I want a missile. These are quote unquote, I want a missile to hit me tonight to end
*  this, to end this, to have people forced into this, into these positions. I mean, this is
*  a bleak, bleak spot on humanity. And of course, anyone who pretends to have any power of this,
*  and clearly those who do have power on this have no concept or no caring of the suffering
*  that these people are enduring.
*  Can you tell me, since you've got there, since you've returned, you've been obviously in
*  and out of Gaza, but can you tell me what you've seen that people really, really need
*  to hear what you've been seeing with your own eyes?
*  I think Tuesday was a very telling day for me because I was at Al-Aqsa Hospital. Again,
*  your viewers know we have seen the systematic devastation of a healthcare system. We've
*  also seen the devastation of agriculture, of an education system. I think it's 95 professors
*  now being killed. We've seen the devastation of housing and homes, devastation of an economy.
*  But a healthcare system. So we've got a handful of hospitals out of 36 that were fully functioning,
*  a handful. Al-Aqsa Hospital was packed, was overcrowded before Sunday's operation, rescue,
*  massacre. Call it what you will. So when I went there on Tuesday, 48 hours later, Owen,
*  of course it's a war zone, but I'm walking with doctors over children with the wounds
*  of war, children missing parts of their limbs, children with horrendous burns, children with
*  those, a bomb blast picks up everything, right? So it picks up tiles and bricks and obviously
*  shrapnel and still these children there. And again, as the doctor said to me, what other
*  evidence does the world possibly need? So I'm there, I'm sitting with a doctor, a bigger partner,
*  father, who's 11 year old daughter. He had not left her side. He said he hadn't stopped crying.
*  And she came to, she became conscious and this spark came across his face. Owen,
*  and then the doctors explained they doubted they would operate. They believed the shrapnel was too
*  close to her brain. These things are everywhere. This is day 250 for these people. I walk outside
*  and a woman is in, I mean, the way in which people have had their, been deprived of everything,
*  including dignity, they hold on. There's a human spirit here that we must talk of, but here's the
*  woman whose home has been bombed, her husband has been killed. She's got two young children. She's
*  in tears asking for a tent. She's asking for a tent. So she put it up on rubble. The idea of the
*  denials of this whilst, I don't think we've seen a moment where there's been such an outcry around
*  the world, but it's matched by this impunity. So I'm struck, Owen, by the level of hardship being
*  forced upon people. But yes, I'm still struck on going to NASA hospital that's somehow been rebuilt.
*  It was a shell six weeks ago. It's a fully functioning hospital. That human spirit, that resolve,
*  that determination is immense. My goodness, there are efforts 24 hours a day to destroy it.
*  I mean, just in terms of that medical system, because we've seen hospitals, medical facilities
*  attacked. We've seen doctors, nurses killed, arrested patients, obviously killed as well. I mean,
*  how is that medical system functioning, coping, not least with the enormous need? I mean, that's
*  including people who had needs, people with cancer beforehand, and now just constant new injuries,
*  children with severe injuries. How is it coping? That's a great question. I guess when I'm at these
*  places, obviously I'm struck by these incredible healthcare workers who are running, who are doing
*  24 hour shifts at the same time their families aren't safe, at the same time they're trying to
*  think that night, how do I get water and wood for my family? This is a trained seven year doctor,
*  how do I get wood for my family tonight? So for me, I'm watching this incredible human
*  acts and I think it's coping. Obviously it's not. You cannot have this level of devastation. I asked
*  the doctor, what supplies do they need? This is part of what UNICEF does. And he simply said,
*  there is no hospital in the world that could have enough supplies to deal with what we are dealing
*  with. So they don't cope. Anyone who has standard illnesses, as you say, diabetes, cancer, the number
*  of people dying with these things, they don't go to these hospitals. It's not safe to get there.
*  If they do, they know highly likely they can't get the treatment. Al-Shifa was a world-class
*  hospital. It has been decimated. So they're not coping. They are being held together by
*  a resolve and a spirit of these people and these medical staff, many of whom have not been paid
*  for many, many months. But to think that they are coping, it's like the humanitarian response.
*  Everyone is doing their best. Aid workers have been killed in numbers we've not seen since the
*  adverse advent of the UN. But to say the aid response was anything other than a bandaid on
*  bloodshed would be untrue. I can hear it. We can just hear the explosions there. I think it must
*  be much louder, obviously, where you're standing. But just so we're commenting on what we can hear
*  there. I mean, in terms of that operation on the military operation, which huge numbers of Palestinians
*  were killed and maimed and injured. I mean, can you just say that because many politicians didn't
*  mention that at all? And many media outlets didn't focus enough on that. I mean, what was
*  that human impact? I mean, you discussed it slightly already, but just so people are aware
*  of what the consequences are of that kind of attack. Yeah, it's a great one. The consequences
*  are that a Palestinian mother like a Palestinian mother like a mum from Australia or from South
*  Africa or from the UK has every bit the same love and desire to protect her child. And that's being
*  ripped away from them. So these people who literally they saw the skylight up, they saw hell
*  in front of them. And this from every single corner it came from the sky, from the land,
*  from the sea, and hundreds of people reportedly killed. And the idea that that can be overlooked
*  somehow defy is the normalization of horror. We cannot possibly normalize the scores and scores
*  of people being killed. We can't normalize, oh, and this idea that people live in a constant
*  sense of fear, much less that there is nowhere safe. So what happened over the weekend,
*  we've said many times, you've said anyone, everyone who is decent has said, of course,
*  the hostages should be home. This is abhorrent that they are somewhere here and that they've
*  been killed and that they were taken in the first place. But a child's life is a child's life. And
*  to see so many people to go to Aluxa, I will go to Aluxa again tomorrow. And I know,
*  man, I know I will see beds emptied or at least the children who were there are no longer there
*  because they have been killed. So what we saw on Sunday, what we saw last night is again,
*  an utter disregard for civilians. Whatever the military aims are of both sides, it's been clear
*  to UNICEF and they said it many months ago, this is a war on children. We don't say that for a
*  headline. We say that based on evidence, based on numbers, based on the idea that when we look
*  at Syria and Afghanistan and horrendous conflicts that hit children, the numbers of children killed
*  and injured here eclipsed those in ways we've never seen before. Yes, this is a densely populated area,
*  but it also speaks to the indiscriminate natures of the attacks. And Sundays was a prime example
*  of that. Can you just explain exactly what as well you've seen with your own eyes, civilians
*  being killed as a consequence of military action? Well, most recently on Wednesday,
*  an aid delivery, a very important aid delivery. UNICEF, we were taking a truck of medical supplies
*  and nutritional supplies for 10,000 children to the north to Gaza City. There is a very laborious
*  process to go through to get those approvals. Those approvals are given by Israel as the occupying
*  power. They have a legal responsibility to facilitate the delivery of aid. We know it's
*  a war of words. It's on record. It's very clear. There have been many, many obstructions,
*  denials and restrictions. In May, we got half as many trucks in as April. OK, it's an important
*  truck. 10,000 children will benefit. Oh, and it's about a 25, 30 mile round trip for this aid
*  delivery. It took us 13 hours. We spent about eight hours at checkpoints or near checkpoints being
*  held. In the end, this truck for 10,000 children was denied despite every piece of paperwork being
*  done. It had to go back. We will try again, but those children and families right now won't get
*  those medical supplies and nutrition. And as we waited, we took the coastal road. I spent a lot
*  of time just watching fishermen Owen, because I've been talking to a colleague, you talk to anyone
*  here and the reality is so much more intense than fiction. And he was explaining to me that his
*  father-in-law over 30 years had built fishing boats. He built five of them when they were bombed,
*  fishing boats, of course, wooden and fuel. He had photos and they just burnt his 30 years of work
*  burnt. His father-in-law had a stroke at that moment. So I'm sitting there watching. I'm thinking
*  about, again, the devastation of economy, devastation of agriculture. And I'm watching about
*  eight fishermen, men, they're probably university professors and engineers up to their knees, each
*  one with a net fishing. I was there for hours, as I'm saying, because we were being denied access.
*  And I'm watching and then suddenly a tank is coming down the road. We get back in our vehicles
*  and the fishermen flee and a little bit further up on the beach, two fishermen are shot as they
*  run. One is shot in the back. One is shot in the neck. I know that because we saw them up close,
*  because I was also with World Health Organization and a paramedic. They radioed to the officials to
*  ask permission to try and give life saving aid, not knowing the situation that was denied. It was
*  denied that we get out and give that. And so these fishermen who were trying to get some food for
*  their family, eventually body bags were given by the United Nations to their fishermen, their friends,
*  their family. I don't know. They went to the beach. They gathered them up. One of these
*  fishermen still had a fishing net trapped around his leg and they brought them up. And that's where
*  I saw where these two men had been shot. I mean, I know you're not there to be in the politics and
*  legality of it, but so we're clear, I can say it. That's a war crime and a very, very straightforward
*  and horrific war crime for each of witness. I mean, just on the medical aid, what was the denial?
*  What was the basis for the denial? No reason given. No reason given. As best as I know,
*  I was listening to radios. Now that radio call, I was on the transmitter, but that radio, the person
*  who made that call was on a different channel. So I didn't hear, but generally you would not get a
*  reason. Certainly, for example, in the same mission, our truck, you're not given reasons.
*  So smoke and mirrors, I simply don't know if a reason was given or not given. Certainly,
*  I wouldn't know what reason would be given to shoot two unarmed fishermen who are fishing that day.
*  And that has knock-on effects as well, doesn't it, for the humanitarian situation, because that
*  deters people from going out and fishing. Although I know people in such a desperate situation,
*  people will try anyway. But in terms of just the aid, I just want to ask you about it. Again,
*  you're not there to be in politics a bit, but Israel keeps saying that they are allowing
*  unlimited aid into Gaza, I'd say in gross denial of the actual reality. But when you hear that,
*  if I say unlimited aid is allowed to get into Gaza, what's the response based on what you see?
*  My first response is to calm my brain and get into a diplomatic language, because I'm so exhausted by
*  the words being used and the war of words versus the reality on the ground. And then to segue
*  into the evidence that, yes, in May, half as many trucks got in as in April, half as many in April
*  was not enough. We're already on that sense of inhuman and famine. So May, it was many less.
*  Why did that happen in May? If we keep looking at language, that happened in May because of a
*  limited offensive in Ra'aqa. That limited offensive in Ra'aqa is the same one that led to a million
*  people who had already been pushed out of their homes, probably had their homes destroyed, a
*  million people being pushed away again. So I'm very conscious of the language being used. And
*  as you know well, there are also very clear statements made where we do have on record
*  what's happening. But it's unfortunate that we get into this war of words because no, the reality
*  is despite the United Nations best efforts and aid workers here in trepidatious times, and we know
*  that more aid workers have been killed here than any time since the UN, and we have very brave
*  partners. It gets denied, it gets blocked. And other times it's just dames though. And there is
*  an awareness that we can't deliberate at night. So we'll be held for X number of hours, knowing
*  then that now that the sun is setting, so now approval is given, we have to go back. So my
*  example on Wednesday was that supplies, medical and nutritional supplies, we already shut
*  stabilization centers for the most critical. Well, they were shut when the military offensive
*  happened for thousands of critically injured, critically unwell children malnourished.
*  So these supplies are life-saving. That truck didn't get there. That happens time and again
*  and again for eight months. I just, I want to put, just put something by you. I'm sorry,
*  I have to rate his name, Ilon Levy. He was the former spokesperson of the Israeli government.
*  And he was responding to a journalist who I've corresponded with in northern Gaza.
*  He was speaking about the famine in northern Gaza. And he responded, the whole Gaza, this is Ilon
*  Levy, the whole Gaza strip is 25 miles long. If there are food shortages in the north, you can walk
*  20 minutes. The 20 minutes, then just let's disregard that. 25 minutes, 20 minutes, 25 miles,
*  25 minutes. I didn't know what he was talking about. But when you hear that, just walk. That's
*  what he said. Just walk from northern Gaza and get some food. Yeah. Yeah. There are several problems
*  with that. One, of course, if you try and come south, there is definitely more food, food in the
*  south. People don't have money. A lot of people don't have money. I meet people every single day
*  in tents with heartbreaking stories. They're okay. They're intense and it's brutally hot. People
*  would might say, oh, they're used to the heat. Well, they're used to the heat in their home.
*  They're not used to the heat. Their home is being destroyed. So there is more food here. People don't
*  have the money. You can't walk from the south, the north to the south because there is a military
*  checkpoint and you absolutely cannot do that. In the north, we've seen the systematic devastation
*  of greenhouses, of agriculture. So there is no food production there of agriculture for chickens
*  and so on. It's been smashed. UNRWA, the backbone of the aid response here has been unable, I think,
*  for many months now to take food to the north. So again, the evidence is sadly, the evidence is
*  sadly very stark because the evidence also speaks to a nutrition crisis among children.
*  You've got parents doing their best. One of the saddest things I think I've seen, Owen, is that
*  parents now know that they can't protect their kids and children also, they look in their parents'
*  eyes and they know that they can't protect them. For a parent to realize that as a parent, if you
*  know you can't, the level of fury that must bring, but then the resignation and that's the
*  bombs from the skies. Then we're talking about night after night, your child only getting one
*  meal. I think it's nine out of 10 children on the Gaza Strip are missing meals. I mean, one of the
*  most shocking, it just stayed with me, in the South Africa submission to the International Court of
*  Justice was discussing how parents couldn't hide from their children that they'd lost control.
*  I just found that a really shocking statement. Yeah, same and I've seen that and I've heard that,
*  particularly children who are a little bit older, a 12-year-old has said that realization when she
*  saw her dad, her dad, right, her father who was just that mountain, a physical so, but also he
*  was a community leader and so that's a hero for her. When she just suddenly realized after the
*  family home had been destroyed and I think they were displaced three times, she suddenly realized,
*  yeah, my father, my rock in this world can no longer protect me. That realization, I don't know
*  what that does to a child psychologically, physically, of course, it's meaning that the
*  child's right, that your dad can actually no longer protect you from the armed drones or from the
*  disease on the ground because we deny the ability to fix sanitation and give water for people to
*  drink. James, we often hear about so-called safe zones where civilians go, they're safe for military
*  operations. What's the reality there? Yeah, from November when this term was first used,
*  it was very dangerous because we knew on the ground people were being killed in designated
*  safe zones. So it had to, the idea of unilaterally declaring a safe zone as well is illogical.
*  Beyond that, there is a legal aspect to a safe zone. It's got to have food, water, medicine.
*  None of these things were provided on. Yeah, the RAF are offensive. It was warned about for so long,
*  we knew what was going to happen. There were months, months to prepare sanitation and toilets
*  and water for people. None of that was done whatsoever. So no such thing, but in the most
*  stark sense beyond no water and food is when people are in safe zones and bombed. When I got
*  back this time talking to a friend I'd made, a very dear friend Omar, and I'd met his whole family,
*  we'd been to the north, his family's down, I'd met them, his mum, his two brothers, really just
*  salt of the earth people. And I hadn't been aware and I asked him how his family was and he,
*  James, you're not, you don't know. I'm like, no, Omar, what do you mean? They were in a safe zone
*  in the family home that he has built. He, as he said, I had a better job. That's what you do.
*  I put my life savings into it. You know, and my mum and my brothers are there. He got a phone call
*  from his brother saying, I think mum is dead. And he said, what do you mean? He said, well,
*  I'm under the rubble now and I can't hear her. So his mother died. His brother was killed in that.
*  His other brother, as they are really two days later, went back to the family home,
*  which had been destroyed, but hey, it's a home. There are things there. Maybe there's photos,
*  maybe there's clothes. He went back to the home, his other brother, when he went back to the home,
*  it was struck again and it killed his other brother. That's a safe zone.
*  The English language really isn't equipped to even describe the horror of this, really, is it?
*  Just a couple of final questions. I mean, you mentioned in terms of, you know, for a long time
*  was this focus on, is the red line for the US, will there be a major operation against RAF and
*  so on and so forth? Can you just expect, because most of Gaza's population in RAF, and now they
*  were displaced again, what's the impact of that? And also that point you made is actually what's
*  really not on people's radar is the collapse in aid distribution since that RAF offensive.
*  Yes, so people have moved. Derebala is called the middle area of Gaza's in three parts of
*  south, Rafa Derebala, the north Gaza city in Jabalia. Derebala is heaving. Derebala has
*  raw sewage down the streets. You've got, you know, middle-class families now living in a tent with
*  sewage, sewage running through. Al Mawassi was the only area in Gaza that I at least knew of that
*  was just sand. It's a very packed place. It was sand for a reason. Nothing, nothing grows there.
*  People are forced there. It's 45 degrees in a tent. I know that. I've tried with a thermometer.
*  So people will think, oh, they've moved. They've moved again. Yeah, but they've moved again to a
*  place that's not safe. They've moved again. Their coping capacity has been smashed that little bit
*  more. Their psychological safety net has faded that additional bit. So ever more important for
*  us to get aid. But the Rafa crossing, that southern point, was the lifeline for humanitarian aid.
*  And that's been closed. So that has dealt another lethal blow. And I hear myself talking,
*  feeling I just can't, I can't convey what those families are going to see in tents today. And
*  there's a, there's a pride, prideness and humility to people. Oh, and but, but they're, they're on a
*  precipice, a physical and a psychological precipice. And somehow we have to imagine that despite the
*  outrage around the world, this thing is continuing. Now, it doesn't mean people should stop. I think
*  they should double down. But, but for those people here in tents, yes, some hold on to hope.
*  Others are starting to hope for the, for the worst.
*  Just a very final question. The dehumanization of the Palestinians takes many forms. And one,
*  I don't think is discussed enough. And that is, I think people basically start thinking of
*  Palestinians as almost, they can, you know, they, they're used to this, that, you know,
*  this kind of level of horror and misery is just part of life in a way it isn't for us. And
*  therefore they can cope in different ways and ways that we wouldn't be able to imagine.
*  And I just, in terms of like you say at the beginning, circle back, a child is a child
*  and a Palestinian child really is no different. It's no different from any other child in the most
*  unbelievable, hideous, apocalyptic nightmare, which has gone on now since the 7th of October.
*  And we're now on the 14th of June. The impact, these are just kids and that's your focus.
*  Just tell us, what is that impact? I just, I mean, how can we best describe to the world
*  what that impact on those kids is? Yeah, unprecedented. We don't know. We're
*  in uncharted territory. There are those children who I speak to who want it to all be over.
*  There are those children who may not recover. The only way to get out of this is for this to end
*  tomorrow and the most immediate recovery. This is Gaza is not a place for children right now.
*  It is hell on earth. Sometimes it's burning hell on earth, but it is their home. Oh, and so, no,
*  we are in an area in terms of the mental health of children. It's not just mental health. It's a
*  mental health crisis around the world. I understand people might say, well, we've got that crisis here
*  and then we do and we should address that. But what we are seeing here is also a population,
*  they cannot leave. They cannot leave. They're seeing attacks like they've never seen before.
*  They're seeing denials of food. They're seeing, as we said earlier, their parents be totally
*  unable to protect them. So when it comes to a young child population, this has long lasting impacts.
*  If we get into the objective territory of what a demographer or an economist will tell you,
*  the ability of this young population, if we get it right, give them the right skills, the right
*  training, my goodness, it's a hard working population. Yeah, that is the resolve they've
*  got. I would crumble here. They don't. But you need to get those skills in that market,
*  that job market opportunities. This is the exact opposite of that. This is the antithesis of that.
*  So an economist will tell you this young population can be a demographic dream,
*  a demographic dividend. The flip side of that is the disaster. And we are knowingly,
*  humanity is knowingly heading, indeed pushing these children further and further into that chaos.
*  Will Barron We're so lucky both in terms of the Shambhala,
*  more generally to have you there in Gaza, in terms of being able to just communicate the horror.
*  I said the English language isn't equipped, but you do manage to use the English language to
*  the best possible ability to just convey the horror that we see. And it's so important the
*  world hears this. The world needs to hear this. It's important people don't move on from this.
*  It's important we don't normalize this. That's always been something we've spoken about a lot
*  on this channel. This can never, ever, ever, ever be normalized. UNICEF do amazing work. I'll include
*  the link to UNICEF so people can donate and support. Please spread this video, share it
*  everywhere, post it to families and friends. Make sure everyone still is talking about Gaza
*  and the impact this is having. Like, comment. But James, honestly, really, really appreciate
*  your work. We're incredibly fortunate to have you. But I know the expression is stay as safe as you
*  can, which is what everyone is supposed to say to people in Gaza. James Corden Yeah, thank you,
*  mate. Thanks for everything, Alan. Thanks for your audience as well.
