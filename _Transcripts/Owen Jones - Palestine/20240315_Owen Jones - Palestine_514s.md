# History Will Damn Israel's Apologists
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [March 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B_ApOQlRGs)
*  Who spoke out against the slaughter of Gaza, one of the great crimes of our time, and who didn't?
*  When we're talking about what one UN official described as the worst rate of killing since the
*  Rwandan genocide, that matters. Our recent history tells us that those who oppose what are these
*  calamitous and murderous foreign wars are the ones who are hounded, attacked and demonised,
*  and so this gruesome iron law re-emerges in the killing fields of Gaza. I'll talk more about that
*  shortly but firstly I was on BBC Scotland's debate night this week, that's their version of
*  Question Time, which I used to appear on about once a year, till I wrote a column over four years
*  ago criticising their handling of racism, I seem to have been blacklisted ever since. Now I was
*  asked about Scotland's First Minister, Humza Yousaf. Unlike the leaderships of the Westminster
*  parties, he's taken a courageous stance over Gaza, demanding the violence ends and condemning
*  Israel for collective punishment very early on. Now he's come under attack from the right-wing
*  media because at the beginning of this nightmare, his relatives were trapped in Gaza. The media,
*  for some reason, then linked this to Humza Yousaf's decision to give money to UNRWA,
*  the main humanitarian agency in Gaza, rather than UNICEF, the children's agency.
*  As I explained in the video, that's completely irrelevant, there is no link.
*  And the onslaught against UNRWA is in my view a genocidal act, contradicting as it does the
*  International Court of Justice's provisional orders demanding access to humanitarian aid
*  in Gaza. So here I am first of all. Owen Jones, was it right the First Minister had to explain
*  himself on this? No, it's a disgrace and I have to say the Scottish people should be proud they
*  had a government which actually stood by the Palestinian people in their darkest hour and the
*  people... the people... the people he should be ashamed of are those who have supported one of the great
*  crimes of our age and tried to strangle the main humanitarian agency in Gaza when we're already
*  having the worst collapse in nutrition in recorded history, 40,000 including those buried under the
*  rubble who were dead, over 14,000 of them children, toddlers, babies, teenagers. Now in terms of this
*  smear campaign against Humza Yousaf, I have to say, is diabolical. First of all, it has nothing to
*  do with his relatives whatsoever. UNRWA, the agency we're talking about, did not rescue his
*  or bring them out. It was the Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office at the Westminster
*  level so it's completely and utterly irrelevant. In terms of UNRWA itself, I have to take you up on
*  that. I have to say what you said there because it is actually... I'm disturbed partly by what you said.
*  Now UNRWA is the main humanitarian agency. There is a humanitarian catastrophe which is not caused
*  by a hurricane or an earthquake or a flood. It's caused by western backed Israeli bombs raining down
*  on innocent people. Gaza now looks a different colour and texture when looked at from space
*  because 70% of its civilian infrastructure has been severely damaged or destroyed. Its medical
*  system has been taken to pieces. In terms of UNRWA itself, that is the main humanitarian agency.
*  There's been a smear campaign against it, I would note, by the Israeli state. The claim, even if you
*  take it on its own merits, is that 12 out of 30,000 employees are associated with the indefensible
*  atrocities committed by Hamas on the 7th of October. Even if that were true, that would be like pulling
*  the plug on the English National Health Service because of Harold Shipman and Lucy Letby.
*  The suggestion was, Owen, that civil servants had said give the money to UNICEF.
*  Well, UNRWA is an agency which is funded and has been funded by the Westminster government,
*  the United States and others. They pulled the plug on the agency based on claims by the Israeli
*  state which they didn't even provide evidence for and they still haven't provided evidence for.
*  And I would note the International Court of Justice, the highest court on earth,
*  issued provisional orders to prevent genocide and one of the main orders was to ensure access
*  of humanitarian aid. That is impossible if you strangle financially the main humanitarian agency.
*  All I would say on that is what the Scottish Government have did and they took a lot of flak.
*  I know that Hanzo Yousuf took a lot of flak and I think he's taken a load of Islamophobic and
*  anti-Muslim bigotry for what he's done. Where from? Well, from much of the media and the right-wing
*  press. And what I'd say on that is, look, again, many of us, I'm sure, have looked through history,
*  looked at terrible atrocities that have happened and I have, I'm sure you have, looked back and
*  thought how was that possible? How did so many people go along with it? How did so many people
*  remain silent? And history can be a savage judge. And what history will ask us in this moment,
*  with one detailed academic study suggesting that one in every 19 Palestinians in Gaza will be killed
*  by August, which is one of the biggest killing sprees of our time, is did people stand against
*  this mass slaughter? Did you stand against that? Did you do something, even though you knew there
*  might be a cost? Or did you facilitate it? And I'll tell you what, history is going to be on the
*  side of Hanzo Yousuf and it's going to damn everyone who went along with this absolute
*  atrocity and obscenity and shame in all of them it did. Okay. Now I just want to make some other
*  points. Let me ask you a question. Why is it the opponents of these horrors who are the ones with
*  questions to answer rather than those who supported the mass slaughter of tens of thousands of people,
*  including so many thousands of kids, the mass destruction of Gaza's civilian infrastructure,
*  as well as the inevitable famine, war crimes? Well, we really could go on. In the 21st century,
*  we've seen multiple Western backed onslaughts and each and every time the architects of these
*  disasters have been proven wrong, not slightly wrong, not mostly wrong, but completely and
*  utterly wrong. And those who warned each time of disaster were not actually proven completely
*  correct, but we were vindicated in the worst possible way, because actually it turned out
*  even worse than many of us predicted. And yet what did we have to show for it? Just a lot of
*  dead people. And I mean, a lot of dead people. According to a study by the prestigious US Brown
*  University, around four and a half million people perished in the post 9-11 wars. If we look
*  specifically at Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, disaster, disaster, disaster, that's quite the understatement
*  in each case. Yet the architects of these disasters march from crime scene to crime scene,
*  completely flustered, their confidence not even slightly battered or bruised, their reputation
*  certainly intact, and yet splattered with more blood each time, and yet still demanding more
*  and more and more blood. It's those who oppose these slaughters who remain treated as at best
*  controversial, but always marginalised and demonised and treated as extremists, while those who
*  supported these slaughters and indeed played pivotal roles in making them happen are treated
*  as statesmen and respectable people and moderates. It's the world turned upside down. Remember Iraq?
*  The only politicians who resigned were those who opposed the war, not the ones responsible for
*  hideous bloodbath which took the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. In the media, the only
*  people expected to take responsibility for quote unquote mistakes were those perceived as critics,
*  whether that be the entire BBC top brass over claims about how the government spammed the case
*  for war or dare I say it, Piers Morgan at the Mirror who published that newspaper at the time,
*  turned out to be fake photographs of soldiers torturing Iraqis when in actual fact we know the
*  evidence for soldiers having committed hideous human rights abuses in Iraq was actually overwhelming.
*  Now the point is again that those who had deemed opponents of the horrors were those who paid the
*  price, not those responsible for total catastrophe. Well we can't keep letting that happen because if
*  you want to know why these hideous massacres keep happening, that's why. No one's held to account,
*  except well of course us, the opponents. As you can see that in the smear campaign against
*  Hamza Youssef because he dared to oppose the terrible crime and the silencing and harassing
*  and sacking and demonising of opponents across the western world as well as the overall smear
*  campaign of course against peace protesters as a bunch of dangerous hateful extremists,
*  unlike of course the conservative government. The world turned on its head indeed but that only
*  happens if we let it. There are a lot of us. So not this time. The crime's too great, too extreme,
*  too unapologetic. We cannot let them get away with it this time. We must hold them responsible
*  and to account otherwise I'm afraid to say many many many more will be killed for many years to come.
