# This Israeli Peace Activist Must Be Heard - w Dana Mills
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [January 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EejBVsaPo80)
*  Hello, ever since this horror began, I've been trying to use this space as best I can to elevate
*  voices we need to hear and that is of course must involve Palestinians and it has to involve
*  courageous Israeli peace activists who I'm constantly in awe of. It's not easy at the
*  moment to be fighting for peace and for justice in Israeli society but there is a very inspiring
*  tradition which I keep going on about. The left as we exist would not exist without the great
*  humanist tradition which is so interwoven with the Jewish tradition and that has shaped the left
*  since its foundation really. So with that in mind it's a huge honour to be joined by Dana Mills
*  who is the biographer of Rosa Luxemburg so when I'm a big admirer of, my twin sister named her
*  and she's also a dance writer and also a fighter for social justice. We've got two big things in common I would say.
*  Half Welsh. Are you half Welsh? I am half Welsh indeed, yeah. My dad is born and raised in Cardiff.
*  You're more Welsh than me. There is I'm afraid a division now opening up which we're going to
*  have to get over which is my dad's family from North Wales, the Chlidyn Peninsula. So we're off
*  to a terrible start, the North South Welsh. That's it, we're done now. The other is a love of cats
*  both every exchange we've had is but I didn't keep my side of the bargain I should have sent
*  pictures of my cats but I'm unfortunately in Paris at the moment I'm not with my cats so I'm a bit
*  cat sick but you've helped by sending me pictures of your cats so I'm less catsick than I was.
*  Let's just not by talking about you if that's all right because I mentioned you're half Welsh so
*  just tell me about because you're half Welsh and you're half Israeli so just tell me about your
*  I guess your background and I guess you know because I want to talk about the Israeli peace
*  movement and you know the current context in that history but just often you know the person is
*  political obviously so just tell me about your history. Okay so first of all thank you so much
*  for having me and the honour is in my entire mind. So I was actually born in Britain but my parents
*  went here when I was just over a year old so I was raised here and when I was in high school
*  that was the era of the Oslo Accords and kind of a big shift in this course around
*  the occupation Palestine. I was 13 when Rabin was murdered, Rabin was the Prime Minister then and
*  the man who tried to push them for peace and I just remember it as a very kind of traumatic moment
*  and I wasn't that clued in in politics. I was a young teenager but I was remember just being
*  shocked at the moment and I had a friend who had been going to peace now youth meetings which were
*  kind of dialogues between Palestinian and Israeli youth and I decided to join along just because I
*  kind of felt I needed to do something and whereas me today looks back at the Oslo paradigm and I
*  hope we can get to that data because I think it's important and I realised that a lot of the things
*  if we were rooting then for then do not hold or did not even hold then and there was a moment of
*  hope and transition in the air. So I spent most of my high school years in kind of activism around
*  the occupation protesting illegal outposts meeting with Palestinian youth and I remember we didn't
*  have the language of apartheid yet and I mean even now some people it is controversial but I
*  remember just being very struck by the everyday experience of going to meet youth of my age and me
*  sort of traveling very easily to meet them and then being held in checkpoints and being always late
*  and always sort of talking about harassment of the army and the army being you know my friends and
*  relatives and then later myself so it was kind of very clear to me that the relationship was very
*  complex and it wasn't just we can sit in a room and we can talk about our differences and then
*  peace will come to the middle east which was kind of the hope behind these gatherings but it was a
*  kind of a early entrance into what we're seeing unfolding right now. So went through my life,
*  pursued a couple of degrees, went to do a PhD at Oxford and spent 13 years in the UK
*  where I wrote my books and got involved in activism locally and in 2021 I felt that the
*  changes around me both I have to say in the discourse around Israel Palestine abroad and
*  what I was seeing at home was too vast were too vast and I felt that it was time to go back
*  to go back and I left academia and I went to work in civil society full-time in various positions
*  first I went back to peace now the movement that educated me and worked in various positions then
*  including the director for a bit and then several other organizations and now I work in an organization
*  called 972 that does incredible work local called 972 in independent journalism and I think for me
*  there was a moment when I realized that I always knew that I was privileged and lucky and I define
*  myself as coming from the wrong side of history I mean I don't see what I'm doing as a choice
*  I see it as a necessity because this is where I am and this is what raised me and made me the
*  person that I am but I also think there was a moment when I realized that as much as I love
*  writing and reading and I could have spent a long time and there are many other academic books that
*  I could have written something pulled me back and I realized that I can't really go on and sort of
*  engage things that aren't working directly on the ground and whereas it's obviously been challenging
*  and hard again I kind of think the challenge is not mine because I have to do it but it's
*  it's not a fun job to be very clear it still feels very necessary and it feels like something
*  that I couldn't get up in the morning and sort of face the questions that I was facing without
*  making this change and I think you know we can we can circle back to Rosa later but I think
*  working on radical Jewish women and writing about women who paid a very heavy price for dissenting
*  and looking at questions of human rights and social justice it felt kind of very fake to be
*  doing that in a library and not sort of challenging apartheid on the ground when my
*  country is enacting it so that's a short drift about me. So you came back in 2021 which is already
*  a very challenging time for some of your politics in these kinds of things but that was before
*  two years before 7th of October and I just think it's an important you know I always talk about moral
*  clarity since this horror began this particular round of horror which is absolutely correct that
*  we shouldn't say that history began on 7th of October the attempt to make the clock begin on
*  7th of October but equally 7th of October was a trauma a huge trauma and there were real atrocities
*  committed and that was always going to have a consequence so as much as people like myself go
*  well actually history didn't begin then but equally you know that was a huge trauma which has inevitably
*  going to have a political consequence so I'm just wondering about that your thoughts on that and the
*  atmosphere just the general atmosphere now for someone who like yourself advocates for
*  Palestinian rights but also makes the argument about the history which is airbrushed out of
*  existence. Yeah so I want to say a few things about the 7th of October and the significant
*  especially human rights camp and then I'll sort of talk about your questions more broadly.
*  A lot of us and I count myself I have family who was displaced has been internally displaced and
*  hasn't been home since the 7th of October I have friends who spent days in shelters I know people
*  who were kidnapped I know people who were killed I have a friend who both met parents were murdered
*  and all these people I mentioned are all kind of activists in my circles so when you say the 7th
*  of October it was traumatic it was especially traumatic for us in the peace camp and on the
*  left broadly I would say and there's something not coincidental about it a lot of people who
*  went to live around Gaza which was this connects to the second part of your question knew that this
*  is key that the connection between Gaza and the rest of the territory between the river and the
*  sea is something that is crucial for any political resolution for any kind of coexistence that has
*  any kind of value and indeed a lot of the people living there were kind of involved in various
*  solidarity actions whether it's I mean my cousin used to drive patients from the checkpoint from
*  the border crossing in Gaza to hospitals in Israel and in other parts of Palestine
*  I think there was this kind of idea that you have to be there and you have to engage and not to let
*  the siege a 17 year old siege it has to be said over Gaza go unnoticed so for us it was a trauma
*  I'm now talking it's kind of my community the human rights and peace community on a two-fold
*  level for our people like these were people who I knew personally and were like me and also there
*  was this kind of hope that government would enable some kind of transition and you know the kind of
*  very basic things that we could do in in the face of this human and cruel siege
*  would make some kind of a difference so it took us some time to recover I have to say honestly when I
*  back on of the timeline it took us several weeks and also to just understand what had happened
*  quite a lot of time to gather information and to understand who was kidnapped who was killed as you
*  know for instance Vivian Silva was a huge inspiration for me personally and it's kind of a really big
*  figure in the peace camp here we only learned she was murdered a couple of weeks after we thought
*  she was kidnapped so you know for weeks we went as I said bring her home so there was all this going
*  on on the other hand and I'm going to say very frankly all of us who chose to engage this directly
*  and I think you know it's very easy to not look at it because the Israeli media and authorities
*  really try to silence any critique of apartheid any kind of any some kind of questions within
*  Israeli public those of us who chose to engage it it's very hard not to see the context and I
*  think there's a very big distinction between understanding context and justifying or condoning
*  you can sort of see where things come from and you can see where desperation and anxiety and
*  sort of long oppression even beyond you know the 17 years of closure we're talking about not even
*  67 we need to start looking back from 48 really and that's you know one of the great trends
*  the left in Israel is having to go through all of this feeds into what unfolded since the 7th of
*  October and I think whereas obviously we're all horrified by the Hamas actions on the first day
*  I kind of said I am petrified and I cannot imagine what Israel would now do in Gaza now since Israel
*  has disengaged when I say disengaged I mean removing its boots from on the ground and
*  settlements from Gaza in 2005 Israel has engaged in something that is colloquially known and used
*  very openly in media as mowing the lawn mowing the lawn is a seasonal attack on Gaza that is
*  kind of there to deter Hamas or scare Gazans or kind of use some kind of perform the the power
*  disparities really and this has been normalized you know this this has been done by all governments
*  including the so-called progressive government that was sitting before Netanyahu's government so
*  it's not something that is unusual and it's kind of again it's normalized within Israeli society
*  this happens even without anything occurring you know this sometimes happens without any kind of
*  not even a provocation it's just the army goes it it devastates houses it makes sure that you know
*  the pain is felt and then the idea is that Hamas will know who they're dealing with so when I saw
*  news coming out on the 7th of October I was kind of thinking I have no idea which way this will go
*  now we we know that Netanyahu's one of Netanyahu's biggest missions and has been and sadly he has
*  been successful in it is to work against any kind of Palestinians of her entity against any kind of
*  connection between various Palestinian communities be it Gaza the West Bank and Palestinians within
*  1948 Israel and East Jerusalem so this is a very opportune moment to just really go with full force
*  and make sure that there will be no connection that there will be no political consciousness
*  and that Palestinians understand that they have no chance in sort of forming any kind of sovereign
*  body and now I'm kind of not even talking about which solution this could look like although we
*  can obviously chat about that also so it felt like this was the perfect storm for him to just go
*  and do something that we knew he had wanted to do which is to create a huge amount of misery
*  and devastation and suffering and ensure that there will never be an independent Palestine of any kind
*  not two state not one state not no state so I think for me that kind of worry together with
*  knowing what the Israeli army is capable of and has been capable of over the years kind of made me
*  kind of concerned from the get-go while of course sort of trying to figure out what's happening with
*  my family and friends etc so so we've been holding all of this and sort of trying to navigate this
*  well also again remembering the 7th of October was horrific and we're still we'll hold it for a
*  while but we're talking about something between ethnic cleansing and genocide that is being done
*  in our name and with our money so for me it's been you know really important to shift and sort of not
*  deny and not you know take lightly the pain of the 7th of October and especially again considering
*  these are my people and we see how the community has been sort of affected by it by it but also to
*  say we have to now focus on what is happening while the world is largely silent I mean firstly
*  just my love and solidarity I mean it's a huge huge trauma to go through and it's so important to
*  talk about that and engage with that of course you know we're talking as you say about the horrors of
*  Gaza at the moment and what with of course the ICJ case and yeah the incredible unbelievable
*  horror they're being released but that doesn't erase of course the trauma that people like
*  yourself felt in atrocities and war crimes which committed on the 7th of October and it's important
*  that we talk about that even if we talk about how that has been used to commit terrible terrible
*  atrocities in the name of I mean that's the point I suppose how you know I mean there are some
*  Israelis who didn't go through maybe I mean I know lots of Israelis did know someone who
*  kidnapped but you know for them there is you know there is an Israeli society and you know what
*  makes you so courageous is and this you know this has happened many times in lots of different
*  societies nothing specific to what's happened to Israel and which is you know I mean the
*  polling is is pretty bleak and more Israelis than not think not enough firepower has been used in
*  Gaza yeah I mean what's your sense then about you know how it's possible for a message like
*  yours to be heard in that context and and what the atmosphere has been like I mean in terms of
*  the way the state has not just used that horror obviously against people Gaza but also to suppress
*  voices for peace within Israel so first of all we need to sort of make a distinction between
*  Palestinian citizens of Israel Palestinians broadly but Palestinians and Israelis because again
*  under apartheid I am still I'm always one of the lucky ones kind of lucky I say in these
*  categories but like we deal with various things that I'll talk about but there has been a very
*  heavy-handed and cruel persecution of Palestinians who dared to show any kind of solidarity with
*  Gaza so or even just kind of any kind of engagement so a doctor was fired for blocking a Jewish
*  colleague a Palestinian doctor was fired after she blocked a Jewish colleague on on Facebook
*  various students were expelled from universities if they liked posts that had a Palestinian flag in
*  them and there's been huge amount of silencing and persecution against Palestinian Palestinians
*  under the kind of guise of this attack so so this has been going on in full force
*  since the seventh and really early on before there was anything that we could kind of discuss in a
*  substantial way and we can sort of say where things were actually going and the Jewish side
*  is always small you know I'm part of a small community and as you say the polling is never
*  good for us but I think for us it's been harder and harder to dissent and I mean just as we speak
*  now there's been two demonstrations cancelled this weekend both anti-war one and both cancelled by
*  the police I should say one actually under the heading only peace will bring security that has
*  been deemed too dangerous for the police to secure which you know shows you how low we've
*  sunk really in terms of allowing any kind of dissent so what I feel is that there has been kind of
*  a very concentrated attempt to silence and to sort of not allow us any kind of space to
*  to not even grieve you know a lot of these gatherings and demonstrations are just to see
*  the community and sort of in the first few weeks it was really to see my comrades and talk about
*  have you heard from such-and-such and have you heard anything because you also don't want to
*  like it's this very awkward situation do you text the person whose parents were kidnapped and ask
*  them what what is happening no it's easier to go to an administration and chat with your comrades
*  so it felt like really kind of clamping down on some of the space that was really important to us
*  but yeah I mean we continue I'm pretty sure there'll be demonstrations tomorrow
*  there have been every Saturday since the very beginning of the war there were a few that were
*  authorized by the police but there are a few of the way we just go out to a specific place and
*  it's pretty undercover and we just protest again I think for us we're we're always not as much
*  targeted as our Palestinian comrades I think there's also this duty of if I go out the worst I can get
*  is to you know get into some brawl with a police person or whatever fine I will probably not lose
*  my job and I'll probably not have to face a lot of sort of personal attacks that my Palestinian
*  comrades are facing so I think there's that kind of element within our community that is very much
*  felt right now but yeah I mean talking about peace during a war is really really hard but it's also
*  I think the most urgent message at the moment so you know you mentioned the ICJ case we're talking
*  the day in which Israel has had his hearing I have to say I didn't listen I was kind of like
*  I wasn't able to bear it instead I ran Hannah Arendt on civil disobedience I felt that was a
*  better way forward with my day but I think we're at a crossroads where we need to decide whether
*  we're supporting international law and human rights as painful as it might be you know for
*  a Jewish woman to hear accusations of genocide is a very difficult thing to face it's you know all
*  our families came from similar sort of backgrounds but it actually makes it more important for us to
*  face and to sort of really hold on to international law and to face the evidence that has been
*  incredibly hard to hear and I did listen to the entire South African submission and to look at
*  the evidence as we see it and I mean Haaretz which is a newspaper published it's like it's
*  cover story on it's we can read around the famine in Gaza so we can talk about the bombings we can
*  talk about the sort of army attacks we can also talk about the fact that close to a quarter of
*  a million people are hungry and this is an hour drive for me and this is done again in my name
*  so we need to sort of face up to all of that and hold on to international law and human rights
*  and peace when when everyone wants us to distract from that and to talk about revenge and to talk
*  about sort of righteous anger this is really the moment when we need to hold on to these
*  universalistic values that sort of sit in the basis of what I see as justice I mean on that one part
*  bother I guess within this atmosphere is the question of the Israeli settled settler movement
*  and what is already the deadliest year of the west bank falls of the October around 240
*  Palestinians died this year before October 7th dozens of children and we've seen a massive
*  increase in that horrendous violence ethnic cleansing basically going on also just settle tax
*  mass incarceration including of children so what and there's also you know that I mean
*  just in terms of Gaza because again you know the date not danger but it's just in terms of how
*  accurate we talk about things here because it's easy for us just see every extreme possible
*  sentiment being expressed and then think that's obviously what's going to happen that's not
*  necessarily the case of course and within this even within Israeli society even you know would
*  would there actually be a huge appetite to resell to start the gars of that kind of thing but there
*  are calls for it so I'm just wondering what you think about those kind of you know the question
*  of the colonization the illegal west bank their expansion and those calls for Gaza
*  combined with calls for ethnic cleansing which are obviously rampant yeah yeah so the west bank
*  and Gaza have been separated intentionally by the Israeli government through what it it says openly
*  is the separation policy and sort of again sort of sometimes it's even you know cutting families
*  from each other communities etc and part of the way that Israel has suppressed Palestinian
*  resistance is to oppress different communities in different ways so if you look at how apartheid
*  sustains itself it's you know you silence Palestinians within Israel in that way and
*  you attack Palestinians in the west bank in that way and then you attack them in Gaza in a different
*  way and then it's harder to garner solidarity and to have some kind of resistance through those
*  policies now what has been happening in the west bank and I should say when I was director of peace
*  now in my years in the movement that was kind of my bread and butter and monitoring settlement
*  expansion and sort of looking at the colonization on the ground we've been talking about annexation
*  for years so when Trump was in power there was the the peace plan which was basically an annexation
*  plan and it was a very big campaign across the board in Israeli progressive circles against
*  annexation and since then we've been using the term sort of creeping annexation although I would
*  say in my observation especially in the last second I'll talk more frankly about the last
*  three years because that's when I was more involved you can't talk about anything that is
*  not annexation in full force because the amount of land grabs and sort of illegal settlement
*  expansion and also legal so you know obviously all settlements are illegal by international law
*  and yet Israel has found a way to sort of legalize certain settlement processes
*  still the data is really astounding now talking about settler violence and settlements I think
*  it's really important to understand that settler violence and settlements and the military force
*  enacted in the west bank all happen together and it's not like you know the Israeli government
*  not so much this one but previous ones like to say oh there are a few bad apples there's these kind
*  of frank if fanatic settlers they do their thing it's hard to control them sometimes they'll arrest
*  one or two and have a performance usually not even that but in effect what we see on the ground more
*  and more and there's some great organizations such as the HDN and B'Tselem we've been monitoring this
*  for years is that very often you will see settler violence and you'll see sort of the army either
*  standing aside or sometimes even joining so Palestinians have kind of zero protection and
*  up against two forces at the same time and the important element about that is to say that
*  settle settler violence is another way to colonize it's another way to scare people
*  off their land it's another way to scare people off their agricultural land when the war when
*  attacks broke out we were in the beginning of harvest season now harvest have become so
*  difficult and so dangerous for Palestinians that they weren't even able to access their lands and
*  what certain Israelis have been doing including myself and comrades is just to go there as
*  protective measure and just to stand there and sometimes settlers will attack less if they see
*  a Jewish person standing or you know being kind of a human shield but even that was impossible
*  so the escalation of settler violence has to be read together with escalation of colonization and
*  of military violence now what we are also hearing now is that with a large part of the military
*  transferred into the west bank we see more and more kind of unhinged settlers putting on
*  uniforms and acting as militias so for years we've been seeing this kind of joining forces of the
*  military and of the settler movement and sort of gaining more and more force on the ground and
*  leaving Palestinians zero ability to protect themselves because what do you do if you have
*  like an army that is funded by some of the richest countries in the world together with settlers who
*  want to steal your land and that's your day-to-day life since the 7th of October 16 communities have
*  been displaced in the west bank and I think it's important to see this again as the counter image
*  of what's happening in Gaza and the intent is the same the intent is to stop any kind of possibility
*  of sub-parasites of variety any kind of connection to the land to displace people to reenact trauma
*  but the tactic is different so whereas I think it's really important all eyes are on Gaza for
*  very obvious reasons but what's happening in the west bank is alarming in different ways and has
*  to be monitored and again I kind of there's there's a lot of work being done really on the ground just
*  to sort of literally count outposts and to see to sort of monitor settler violence to see what the
*  effects are on day-to-day life there and I think it's really important to just sort of keep an eye
*  and you know again if we believe in international law and justice one day all these things will be
*  brought just as much as we saw the evidence being brought around Gaza so my hope is that one day all
*  these protocols will be brought and sort of used for persecution as well. Before I ask my final
*  question just in terms of what happens next and you know it's interesting because I spoke to Gideon
*  Levy who's a brilliant journalist very courageous journalist yeah quite a pessimistic guy if I'm
*  honest and his view things have just got to the point where it will do nothing will change without
*  external pressure and therefore what you know looking at the United States which obviously
*  the US the way Israel behaves is so dependent on the US a younger generation is shifting their
*  attitudes not least a younger generation of Jewish Americans I would say which is quite exciting
*  and what do you think I mean is it just I mean that that would be quite a pessimistic case for
*  your movement at the moment and you know also on that what we can do outside to help because I
*  think you know one of the things that's always for me very striking when I speak to Jewish
*  communists in Britain let alone in Israel is you've got sometimes felt this nightmare so
*  nightmare where you on the one hand you have apologists for the these the apartheid and so on
*  calling yourself hating Jew and then you have others on the left you don't take anti-Semitism
*  seriously and so I'm just wondering what we so I guess there's two points can the Israeli peace
*  movement build itself from what is a very marginal position at the moment very very weak position
*  how is that possible and how can how can we help from a broader point I think things are really
*  bad actually horrific to be more accurate I wouldn't be advocating for this if I didn't
*  believe that at some point and I don't know if my in my lifetime I hope it happens sooner rather
*  than later because the cost in human life is one that we cannot bear you know dwindling on this
*  and sort of letting things slide we're talking about tens of thousands of people being killed
*  in just over three months which is not I don't think you know someone who comes from our tradition
*  as a Jewish person who knows you know when you look around when you see the evidence when you
*  sort of hear reporting we know what this means we I'm not a legal scholar but when I see evidence
*  from Gaza it's pretty genocidal you know it's hard to avoid that so I think for me and for
*  people around me we have to keep advocating because that's our only choice and we can't
*  despair we don't have the privilege to despair I think it's really important to be focused on
*  what we're advocating for and again sort of hold on to those things that actually you know an
*  interesting way the genocide convention and the state of Israel are all kind of children of the
*  second world war and we're talking about a moment where the world recognized that we need some kind
*  of bar that we need to judge actions according to so for me holding on to that and keeping
*  the advocacy focused on that and talking about solutions and talking about what we need to think
*  about when we talk about solutions if I may share a small story from my own life that is kind of
*  relevant to that so in 2022 I was the director of peace now and I went to demonstrate in Sheikh
*  Jarrah where there's expedited ethnic cleansing going on has been for years by settlers displacing
*  Palestinians and on that day an attack on Gaza started when we were there we were standing with
*  Palestinian families in risk of being displaced from their homes and suddenly we heard the news
*  that an attack on Gaza started and I was standing next to my friend and comrade
*  Ori Noy who's the chair of B'Talem a very very courageous and inspirational woman to me
*  and suddenly we heard that the four-year-old girl was killed by Israeli bombings a right-wing
*  journalist comes up to us and says aren't you ashamed to stand here with Palestinian flags and
*  with these people and sort of you know gestures that the Palestinians were standing with when
*  your army is fighting and Ori said on the record I'm ashamed of what my army is doing
*  and I just felt this kind of crystallized where we are right now in terms of resistance and also
*  in a way it's also connecting me to sort of thinking about solutions and what we're advocating for
*  because Gaza is so important for and has been for Palestinian resistance because it harks back to
*  1948 and it harks back to talking about the Nakba opening which is really hard for Israelis
*  but is necessary and talking about how all of us Palestinians and Israelis can somehow find a way
*  to live here because none of us are going anywhere I think that's the kind of crucial thing to say
*  we need to stop the violence we need to stop the genocide there are two peoples here we need to
*  figure out a way to live together so I think that moment for me and sort of just hearing
*  Ori say that and then just having that also this very strong feeling like when a four-year-old girl
*  was killed in your name there's only one thing that you can say and that is kind of thinking
*  about the grander sort of cause we're motivating we're advocating for and that motivates us really
*  I should say in in parentheses and this is where the story also takes a turn towards talking about
*  solutions that when I got home that evening I was really really upset obviously we didn't even know
*  if we would get back from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv where I'm based I got a phone call from one of
*  my board members at Peace Now who told me off for being this sort of being disrespectful to the army
*  and you can't talk about the army during a war so I think when we look at the outlook for the
*  peace movement we need to really support and encourage those of us who are willing to sort of
*  speak up and to also realize that the silencing here again it's much much harder against
*  Palestinians but even against us and I was kind of very small party to that but I still felt like
*  you know of all the things you can tell me of that day that board member found it right to just say
*  why are you talking about Gaza and why are you talking about the army you shouldn't you shouldn't
*  engage with that like you do as you told kind of thing so for me that was a really sort of turning
*  point where I realized that I cannot but think and talk about really foundational principles of
*  justice and what brought us here and as you said nothing started the 7th of October things started
*  way way before you can start 48 you can start at 29 you can start even you know 1882 but we need to
*  sort of really think about the context and again this doesn't mean that I'm a self-hating Jew this
*  is my home I came back here volitionally this is my community I don't see myself ever living
*  anywhere else but I also realize that I need to find a just way to live with people around me
*  so that's kind of something around the peace movement and where we're heading and what I
*  I don't feel I have the privilege not to be an optimist because I don't think it's for me to
*  to sort of give up on hope it's for other people maybe. I think there's a beautiful way of putting
*  it just finally it would be a miss not to ask given you the biography of Rosa Luxemburg
*  for those who don't know much about Rosa Luxemburg she was a Polish German Jewish revolutionary
*  and when World War 1 began much of the European left just lined up behind their governments as
*  their governments sent huge numbers of working-class men to their deaths in a orgy of mass slaughter
*  which then defined essentially everything that's happened since 14 and she stood against that war
*  of course very courageously and again for those who don't know she was murdered exactly almost
*  now 115 oh is that right 105 so 105 years ago along with Karl Liebnick another leading
*  revolutionary at the time killed by the Freikorps far right paramilitary nations hired by the
*  German social democrats to wipe out the revolutionary left I just want to make what would she's she's
*  interesting I'm fascinated because she's quite an interesting good national self-determination
*  which I'm not quite sure what she can take but what of course what can we learn just quickly
*  yes from Rosa what could we learn from Rosa um first of all I should say that writing a biography
*  is something that kind of immerses you in the life of a person and she kind of becomes part of you and
*  then she kind of carries on with you whether you like it or not um I think when I was writing the
*  book it took me about five years all in all and I was really kind of overwhelmed by it it wasn't
*  even courage she just like she couldn't do anything differently and sometimes when you're kind of in
*  this intimate relationship you're kind of like don't do that that's a really bad idea like don't
*  write that pamphlet that will not work well and then she wrote the pamphlet and like you know
*  without fail it did not go well um so I but there was something really non-compromising about her
*  and I think there was her gut her gut instincts are very strong and whether she was right or
*  wrong she followed them and very often she was right especially on the on questions of morality
*  and politics and I think it's very easy to conflate law and morality and politics but they're very
*  often distinct and on morality I think she she really did kind of work on her gut instinct and
*  she was right and I mean what would she have made of the situation right now first of all I should
*  say that there's a great um fun that goes positive looks about Stiefelung that is doing that kind of
*  work of bringing her legacy on and that kind of um try to to make question and I kind of
*  engage with them in thinking about that together I think one thing that really stays with me and
*  has been has kind of stayed with me since the seventh is an emphasis on humanity and on um
*  kind of non-compromising humanity and I mean one of her most famous letters um that she wrote
*  in prison she was actually in prison for anti-war campaigning she talks about um
*  buffaloes carrying um blood-soaked um shirts coming from from the battle and how she feels
*  so horribly for the buffaloes and that kind of all the the wrong of the war is crystallized in
*  that moment and I think there's something also when she writes about the war she's angry at the war
*  she's angry at leaders who enact the war but there's this kind of feeling that everyone loses in wars
*  and you know I've been going out most weeks since every week since the photo started actually
*  and I've always kind of written online no one wins in wars I think there's this really important
*  sense of like violence just begets more violence and revenge begets more revenge etc and especially
*  kind of power dynamics and she she was then operating in Germany which was by far the
*  strongest in the international left sorry Britain um but she kind of said we're doing we're on the
*  wrong side of history that was like a very strong sense her analysis of colonialism and imperialism
*  in relationship to the war was kind of really kind of she was the first person to write about
*  Morocco versus Germany in that context so I think all of these subtleties but together and holding
*  on to this humanity and this other letter that she writes and she says see that you stay human
*  and I think for me that was a calling that you cannot look at what's happening in Gaza you cannot
*  look at it and be silent and still be human you will lose your humanity I am not a self-hating
*  Jew I'm not even a self-hating Israeli I am who I am I was born into this situation and I believe
*  oppression basically makes all of us lesser people we're all less humans if we're party to oppression
*  anyone who is now silent on Gaza anyone and this is also going back to another question you asked
*  anyone who is silent and not amplifying dissent and not talking about what's happening in Gaza
*  is losing in their humanity and we all we will all use as a world this is not to say that the
*  prices are the same you know the Palestinians in Gaza who are under a genocidal attack
*  and are starving and are suffering diseases I can't even say it you know it's happening
*  an hour for me and it's this kind of heart to stomach that this is actually happening
*  they deserve our solidarity as human beings I think we don't need to go into the whole
*  pro-president pro-israeli pro anti-president anti-israeli we need to be pro-human and we need
*  to speak up for humanity for justice for international law and for peace so I think for
*  me Roza is kind of always a reminder that I can do better as a human being because she always
*  kind of pushed her friends and she was a really extraordinary human being and to try and remain
*  human and it's very hard right now to remain human there's so much going that between again
*  the effects of the seventh and holding that grief and then sort of just being party to all of this
*  and seeing all of that unfold but having that benchmark I think is something that we can
*  definitely learn from her amen I think you're right it's a war on humanity in two ways isn't
*  it the war on human beings but it's not more on our sense of humanity and we have to fight that
*  everything that we've got and Dan that was such an honor honestly you spoke so beautifully and
*  again you spoke with huge humanity I think Roza looks a little bit very proud but you do give us
*  hope and however marginalized you may be now I know I mean I often say you know when we say history
*  will be on the side history will vindicate you know I know that sometimes feels overly optimistic
*  and simplistic but it seems the horror is so absolute that how can it not the road ahead for
*  the human species is completely bleak how not be that voices let your own will not end up
*  vindicated and if they're not we're doomed anyway so on that note it was a huge honor
