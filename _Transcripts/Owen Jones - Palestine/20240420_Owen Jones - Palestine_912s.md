# This Obscene Israeli Lie Taken Apart - And The Damning Truth It Tells Us
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4mU4uaKU0c)
*  As I've noted several times, Israel's modus operandi goes a bit like this. Commit a terrible
*  atrocity that unlike most atrocities committed by Israel and Gaza, receives significant media
*  attention. Then deploy denial, deceit, deflection, muddy the waters, try to make the public think
*  it's all a matter of he says, she says, wait for attention to move elsewhere. So it just becomes
*  another murky incident in the fog of war. Who really knows what happens? Maybe we never will.
*  That kind of thing. Now the Israeli state exploits the fact that we rely on
*  unbelievably courageous Palestinian journalists who've suffered the biggest massacre of journalists
*  ever recorded in any conflict ever, whose work is not treated with the due respect
*  by the Western media that they deserve. They exploit the fact, the Israeli state,
*  that they've refused entry to foreign journalists and independent observers who
*  conceive themselves the hideous war crimes being committed by Israel on a daily basis.
*  That with Gaza being thoroughly destroyed, much of it is hard to access in any case for surviving
*  journalists who are in a constant battle for the survival of both themselves and their own families,
*  not least because of starvation. As for aid workers also who bear witness, they suffered
*  the biggest slaughter of their profession in such a short space of time ever recorded.
*  Now the Israeli state also benefits from the fact, of course, above all else, that Western
*  media coverage is decisively biased in its favour. All of this has allowed the Israeli state to get
*  away with murder on a mass scale, slaughtering tens of thousands of Palestinians, including those
*  buried under the rubble whose deaths are not included in the official statistics, mostly,
*  overall, women and children. Yeah, children. The mass butchery of kids has been one of the
*  most sadistic facets of this hideous genocidal onslaught, and one striking example, just
*  one example, but a horrific one which resonated with people, was that of five-year-old Hind
*  Rajab and her family. Not only were they all slaughtered by the Israeli military, but so too
*  were two paramedics who were sent to rescue little Hind as she spent her last terrified moments,
*  the last terrified hours of her life, in a car crammed with the dead bodies of her relatives,
*  telling a responder how she was scared of the dark, begging to be rescued.
*  This one atrocity alone, if it had been committed by a state hostile to the West,
*  would have been front page news at the top of the bulletins. Frankly, it's a sort of atrocity which
*  would be used to justify a military intervention against such a hostile state. If this atrocity
*  had been committed on the 7th of October by Hamas, or indeed other such armed groups,
*  with Israeli kids and their relatives being butchered in the exact same way, and the ambulance
*  sent also being blown apart with two paramedics murdered, that would have become known as one of
*  the most noted atrocities committed that day, with wall to wall coverage about how that showed the
*  utter depravity and barbarism of Hamas and it would have been used accordingly to justify the
*  all out onslaught against Gaza. You know it's true what I'm saying here, don't you? You know it's
*  true. This one case study, and bear in mind when you include those buried under the rubble, the
*  credible estimates are of around 20,000 Palestinian kids who suffered violent deaths at the hands of
*  the Israeli state. This one case study is indicative of the absolutely unashamed, loud and proud racism
*  which defines coverage of this obscenity, in which there has been zero, no, that Palestinian life
*  has equal worth to that of an Israeli life, or frankly even the tiniest fraction of worth.
*  Now the Israeli authorities played their usual game here, as I say, in the case of the massacre
*  of Hind, her family and the paramedics who were sent to rescue her. They tried to suggest it
*  could not have been them because their forces were not in the area. This claim should always
*  have been treated with total contempt from the very outset, but it wasn't, allowing the western
*  media not to pin this decisively on the Israeli state as an atrocity which they unequivocally
*  clearly committed, leaving it pigeonholed completely absurdly as yet another horrible
*  but murky incident in which we simply can't clearly say who did what. Now the Washington
*  Post have done a detailed investigation which has destroyed Israeli claims. Now some of you might
*  go, hold on a minute there, the Washington Post, isn't that an example of the western media you
*  keep savaging over Gaza? There's no question there has been hugely commendable, crucial journalism
*  published in the western media on the bloodbath of Gaza, no questions whatsoever, and I've referred
*  several times to examples. In fact the Washington Post did another really important study which I
*  also referred to which taught the pieces Israeli lies about the first all-out onslaught against
*  El Shifa hospital last November, which was, until its destruction, of course the biggest hospital
*  in Gaza. The problem is you get a few of these brilliant pieces of investigative journalism
*  looking at a tiny proportion of the actual atrocities committed by the Israeli state
*  long after the actual atrocity has happened and overwhelmingly attention has moved on from that
*  particular atrocity. Now some might say, completely legitimately, well look, investigative journalism
*  it takes time, it takes resources, and as noted foreign journalists have been barred from entering
*  Gaza which makes it all the more difficult to establish the facts on the ground, except all of
*  this. The problem is none of this compensates for the overall framing of western coverage, whether
*  that be the failure to frame coverage around the numerous genocidal statements of Israeli leaders
*  and officials and generals and soldiers from the beginning which all clearly demonstrate the intent
*  behind the onslaught against Gaza, and the case studies such as this do not then feed into that
*  overall coverage of definitively concluding that a. Israel is committing and has committed
*  hideous war crimes on an industrial scale and that defines the onslaught against Gaza,
*  and b. That the Israeli state routinely and obsessively lies about its atrocities and
*  therefore western media outlets should treat Israeli claims accordingly as they would very
*  correctly about similar such claims from official Russian sources. So we end up with the overall
*  coverage being, well, let's debate whether Israel's so-called military response is proportionate or
*  not, or how disproportionate is it, rather than being a case of, well clearly the Israeli state
*  has made its genocidal intent very very clear and we can see based on the utter ruinous destruction
*  it has unleashed as well as an entirely manufactured famine that it has made good on
*  its genocidal promises and that Israeli denials are simply not credible whatsoever. We shouldn't
*  have to cling onto these pieces of investigative journalism as life rafts full of gratitude about
*  war crimes being exposed because they're not being used to frame overall coverage and frankly what
*  proportion of people are even going to be aware of these very commendable pieces weeks after the
*  atrocity in question happened. Now as I keep saying overall Gaza, the Israeli onslaught against
*  Gaza is the greatest journalistic scandal of our time. Now let's look at this Washington post piece
*  with that context in mind. Now it details what happened that horrific day. Five-year-old Hind
*  Rajab and her family and the paramedics, so altogether 10 civilians, were killed on the 29th
*  of January. They were fleeing the family, their neighborhood, in western Gaza city after 9.30am
*  or so that morning, the IDF issued a call in Arabic on Twitter asking civilians in that area
*  to evacuate, in other words, forcible displacement with a threat of violence. Now Hind's uncle and
*  aunt packed Hind and her four cousins into the car with a plan driving north out of the zone covered
*  by the evacuation order to the family home in northern Gaza city. They did not get far. By 1pm,
*  Hind's 15-year-old cousin, Lein, called another uncle to say that they were surrounded and that
*  the Israeli army had opened fire on their car and that everyone in the vehicle except the lion and
*  Hind were dead. Now Lein then rang the Palestine Red Crescent and said, they are firing at us,
*  the tank is next to us, the tank, very important that. You then hear rapid gunfire and Lein screaming,
*  that's the moment she was also killed. Now the acoustics expert hired by the Washington post say
*  there were 62 gunshots in six seconds, that it was faster than an automated AK patterned rifle of the
*  sort used by Hamas fighters and the rate was more akin to weapons commonly issued to Israeli forces.
*  A satellite image around an hour later, the Washington post notes, found at least four
*  Israeli armoured vehicles around 300 metres away from the car with more than a dozen other Israeli
*  armoured vehicles visible within a quarter mile of the car. Now experts who looked at the images
*  found the turret-like structures consistent with the appearance of Israeli armoured vehicles and
*  the gunshots heard are consistent with machine guns used by those said Israeli vehicles,
*  military vehicles. So then what happened? Hind, little Hind, rang the Palestine Red Crescent and
*  described the tanks moving closer to the car. The operator liaised between the Palestinian authorities
*  health ministry in Ramallah, the West Bank and Kogat, the IDF arm which covers the occupied
*  Palestinian territories and said that this operator, that permission for an ambulance to get to Hind was
*  given in the form of a route map from Kogat. To quote from the article, the map reviewed by the
*  post appears to have been made in Google Maps and has a clear blue line instructing the ambulance
*  drivers to follow an indirect route that avoided much of the evacuation area. The ambulance was
*  then dispatched and you can hear the paramedics liaising with the operators discussing then a
*  green laser hovering just in front of them before one of them says oh there and there's an explosion.
*  Now the article says the green laser, known as a dazzler, would normally suggest that the ambulance
*  was identified but not necessarily targeted by a ground unit operating ahead of the armed vehicles
*  according to Averhey Stoller, a researcher with Breaking the Silence, an advocacy group
*  composed of Israeli army veterans who oppose the occupation and that has compiled testimonies from
*  former soldiers. Now on the call with Hind you hear a bang around the time the ambulance was
*  blown up. By this point Hind was falling silent for long periods. The team tried to keep her talking
*  but she kept saying come get me quickly. She said she was scared of the dark but then soon after
*  they lost contact with five-year-old Hind. 12 days later the car was found, the bodies of all of them
*  in that family car thoroughly decomposed and as the article notes a page from what looks like a
*  colouring book was crumpled where their feet would have rested. The ambulance nearby was a burnout
*  shell with almost nothing remaining of the paramedics bodies. A fragment of a US-made weapon
*  which can be fired by the relevant tank was visible though they couldn't conclude, the experts,
*  if it was directly connected to the ambulance strike. Meanwhile the article notes based on
*  munitions experts that common rocket launchers used by Hamas wouldn't create the observed damage.
*  It concludes by saying none of the six munitions experts interviewed by the post could say
*  definitively what munition caused the damage or killed the paramedics based on the ambulance alone
*  because of the time it lapsed and the complexity of urban combat. They agreed however that the
*  damage to the ambulance was consistent with the potential use of a roundfile from Israeli tanks
*  that matched the vehicles captured in satellite imagery in the area that day.
*  Now the IDF had said it had conducted earlier a preliminary investigation and that its forces
*  were not present near the vehicle or within the firing range of the family car. That was a lie.
*  They were lying. A straightforward lie. Again. Now it's obvious they were all killed by the Israeli
*  state because I saw people, some apologists for this heinous crime by which I mean Israel's
*  onslaught against Gaza saying well it's not definite, it's not conclusive. Well yeah obviously
*  we don't have journalists on the ground. We can't observe exactly what happened. The
*  car and the ambulance couldn't be reached for 12 days. But you can see there was absolutely no
*  chance clearly based on all of that evidence that it could have been anything other than those
*  Israeli vehicles who the Israeli state lied and claimed weren't even there. It's just you know
*  at the end of the day you just have to just look at what all the evidence overwhelmingly points to.
*  And that's that they were clearly killed by the Israeli state and that the Israeli state lied
*  about the circumstances. Again. Indeed you could hear and this is just you know having to go through
*  this as though there's some sort of doubt about what actually happened. You know you could hear
*  the girls who were killed talking about tanks firing on them. Now Hamas and other armed Palestinian
*  groups obviously don't have tanks. That really should have been open and short evidence from the
*  get-go. I mean what would be suggested here that five-year-old Hind and her 15-year-old cousin were
*  lying as they sat there with their murdered relatives terrified being fired upon before they
*  too were killed. For what reason? Do you really think what five-year-old Hind was just there
*  saying there was a tank when there wasn't a tank firing on them? I mean it's just not credible is
*  it? So yes you can't say well here's the munition that killed them and therefore you know that shows
*  who did it or what. We know the tanks were there. We know they said they were being fired on by tanks
*  and we know from what the experts on munitions say that the rates of the bullets being fired
*  was consistent with Israeli machine gun fire from those relevant tanks rather than say Hamas guns.
*  And indeed in terms of the ambulance itself though it wasn't sure people couldn't say well that
*  disrupt that green laser who did that or not. But the evidence shows very clearly that an ambulance
*  could not credibly have been blown apart with such catastrophic damage by a rocket launched
*  by the sorts of weapons used by Hamas or the armed groups. Now the Israeli state, the reason the
*  Israeli state, this is what's so important, gets away with atrocities like this. Some of the worst
*  atrocities of the 21st century, keep that in mind, is because the repeated failure of the western media
*  to hold them to account and to frame their coverage around the reality of what the Israeli state is
*  actually doing. So we end up with detailed commendable work here which clearly just shows
*  all the evidence points in one direction and one direction only that the Israeli state murdered
*  that family and the ambulance crew but we only get that with these core celebs because in this case
*  we have the audio of a terrified five-year-old girl talking to a responder and that gives the story
*  of prominence that other atrocities do not get, the vast majority don't get. We don't get detailed
*  work about each of the what 20 000 or so potentially kids who have been violently
*  slaughtered at the hands of the Israeli state. So all of the violent butchering of all those kids,
*  their deaths are anonymous, lost in the entirely manufactured so-called fog of war. So yeah,
*  this investigative journalism is important, I'm sharing it with you because we can't let the
*  Israeli state keep committing atrocities and just wait for attention to move on until the truth
*  definitively comes out. Just not, to say it's nowhere near good enough is itself an understatement.
*  We need this evidence to frame the actual overall narrative, the story of what Israel is doing to
*  the Palestinian people of Gaza and beyond because otherwise this isn't even scratching the surface.
*  This
*  will continue in any case. Using this platform as best as possible to raise attention to the
*  atrocities being committed, the lies and the catastrophic failure of western journalism
*  when discussing this crime. Please like and subscribe, do leave your comments,
