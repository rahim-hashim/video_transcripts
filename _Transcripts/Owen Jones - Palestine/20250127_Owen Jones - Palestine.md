# Trump Plots ETHNIC CLEANSING Of Gaza - Israel's Plan From The Start
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [January 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE)
*  ethnic cleansing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=0.0s)]
*  That is what Donald Trump has proposed for the surviving population of Gaza. Whilst on [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=1.0s)]
*  Air Force One, during a huddle with US journalists, he discussed his plans to drive the people [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=5.84s)]
*  of Gaza into Egypt and Jordan in order to quote unquote clean out that whole thing. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=11.0s)]
*  Let's have a listen. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=16.36s)]
*  I'd like Egypt to take me, I'd like Jordan to take me, you're talking about probably [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=17.36s)]
*  a million and a half people and we just clean out that whole thing. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=23.88s)]
*  This is not some off the cuff remark from Donald Trump. As Amit Segal, chief political [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=29.36s)]
*  analyst on Israel's Channel 12 News tweeted, Senior Israeli officials, Trump's statement [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  about the migration of Gazans to Muslim countries is not a slip of the tongue but part of a [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=38.4s)]
*  much broader move than it seems, coordinated with Israel. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=42.72s)]
*  Now it's been transparently clear from the start that Israel's game plan has been to [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  annihilate Gaza, make it unfit for human habitation and then destroy the Palestinian people living [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=51.08s)]
*  there in three ways. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  One, by slaughtering them, that is through direct violence. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=58.88s)]
*  Two, killing through indirect means, so for example intentionally destroying the healthcare [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=62.36s)]
*  system and depriving them of the essentials of life. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=67.14s)]
*  And three, by driving them out of Gaza altogether. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=70.08s)]
*  And this again underlines the absolute travesty that is Western media coverage. From the beginning, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=73.32000000000001s)]
*  as the Israeli state forcibly drove the Palestinian people of Gaza from their homes within the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=78.5s)]
*  destroyed their homes, the Western media, if they had done their job, would have reported [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=84.28s)]
*  on the threat that Gaza would be violently emptied of its people, that is those who survived. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=89.56s)]
*  They did not do so. And they have no excuse. Because some of us warned about this over [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=94.84s)]
*  and over again. But our warnings were ignored and more generally we were treated as fringe [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=99.08s)]
*  extremists. I'll give you an example. This is me in November 2023, just weeks after all [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=104.52000000000001s)]
*  of this began. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=109.44s)]
*  This is huge and absolutely chilling. And it exposes the scale of the crime which Israel [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=110.8s)]
*  could now be undertaking. An official document from the Israeli Ministry of Intelligence has [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=117.6s)]
*  been leaked. It's in the hand of some dissident Israeli newspapers. And this official document [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=123.36s)]
*  recommends the forcible and permanent removal of Gaza's 2.2 million Palestinians to Egypt's [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=130.04s)]
*  Sinai Peninsula. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=136.72s)]
*  We have a term for this. It is called ethnic cleansing. This is me in February 2024, about [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=138.6s)]
*  a year ago. Now we also know that the government is jam-packed full of people who want to ethnically [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=145.48s)]
*  cleanse Gaza because they keep saying so. Let's just go through the timeline here. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=150.68s)]
*  Less than 24 hours after the 7th of October attack took place, Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=155.44s)]
*  I say to the residents of Gaza, leave now because we will operate forcefully everywhere. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  There was no subtlety there at all. What Israel actually did of course is drive the vast majority [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=166.6s)]
*  of the Palestinian people of Gaza from their homes. But they remained within Gaza as it [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=170.6s)]
*  was destroyed. Weeks after the attack, Israeli General Giora Eiland, former head of the Israeli [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=175.48000000000002s)]
*  National Security Council, wrote an article in which he said, the people of Gaza will [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=181.32s)]
*  have to leave either temporarily or permanently via the border with Egypt. He added, Israel [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=186.32s)]
*  should not allow any economic assistance. The people should be told that they have two [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=192.84s)]
*  choices, to stay and to starve or to leave. If Egypt and other countries prefer that these [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=196.6s)]
*  people will perish in Gaza, this is their choice. I prefer something that is more reasonable. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=201.88s)]
*  This piece was written in Fathom Journal, which is the media arm of BiCom, that is the British [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=208.28s)]
*  Israel Communications and Research Centre and the main pro-Israel lobby organisation [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=214.28s)]
*  in Britain. Giora Eiland was advisor to Yoav Galan, the former defence minister, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=219.8s)]
*  who is subject to an international arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=224.44s)]
*  for war crimes and crimes against humanity. In South Africa's submission to the International [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=230.12s)]
*  Court of Justice as part of their case against Israel for genocide, there were multiple other [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=235.0s)]
*  statements by Eiland which were noted. For example, he went on to say that Israel has no interest [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=240.28s)]
*  in the Gaza Strip being rehabilitated and this is an important point, he said, that needs to be [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=245.88s)]
*  made clear to the Americans. He declared, to retrieve the hostages, a severe humanitarian [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=250.68s)]
*  crisis in Gaza must be created, with water supplies specifically targeted. He said Israel's army must [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=256.6s)]
*  create such a huge pressure on Gaza that Gaza will become an area where people cannot live. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=263.8s)]
*  He declared, the State of Israel has no choice but to make Gaza a place that is temporarily [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=269.64s)]
*  or permanently impossible to live in. These are different statements, I'm just going through them [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=274.6s)]
*  to emphasise how consistent his message was. Indeed, again, he was keen to reiterate, saying [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=278.36s)]
*  Gaza will become a place where no human being can exist. He additionally wrote, who are the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=284.92s)]
*  quote unquote poor women of Gaza? They are all the mothers, sisters or wives of Hamas murderers. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=290.84000000000003s)]
*  He declared that severe epidemics in the south of the Gaza Strip will bring victory closer. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=298.52000000000004s)]
*  It is precisely its civil collapse that will bring the end of the war closer. When senior [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=303.24s)]
*  Israeli officials say in the media, it's either us or them, we should clarify the question of who [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=308.6s)]
*  is them. They are not only Hamas fighters with weapons, but also all the, in quotes, civilian [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=313.08s)]
*  officials, including hospital administrators and school administrators, and also the entire [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=319.88s)]
*  Gaza population who enthusiastically supported Hamas and cheered on its atrocities on October 7th. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=325.8s)]
*  Again, no subtlety. Collective guilt, the very basis, of course, of genocide. It should be noted [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=333.08s)]
*  that Giora Island is not seen in any way as an extremist within Israel's political system, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=341.8s)]
*  far from it, he's seen as a moderate. And he devised a so-called generals plan, which proposed [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=346.68s)]
*  a total siege of northern Gaza, forcing its surviving population to flee, which Israel then [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=351.24s)]
*  executed. Now, at the end of October 2023, a 10-page document was leaked to the Israeli [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=357.96s)]
*  Palestinian news outlet, Plus 972 magazine, originating from Israel's Ministry of Intelligence. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=363.08s)]
*  It recommended the forcible and permanent transfer of Gaza's population to Egypt's Sinai desert. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=370.36s)]
*  It discussed a plan to evacuate the civilian population, it said, to Sinai. It suggested [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=376.92s)]
*  messages directed at Palestinians should revolve around the loss of land, making it clear that [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=381.96s)]
*  there is no hope of returning to the territories Israel will soon occupy, whether or not that is [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=386.6s)]
*  true. It said the image needs to be, Allah, make sure you lose this land because of Hamas leadership. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=391.0s)]
*  There is no choice but to move to another place with the assistance of your Muslim brothers. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=396.6s)]
*  The Intelligence Minister at the time was seen as a relative moderate. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=401.08000000000004s)]
*  In December 2023, according to Israel Haayon, the daily newspaper in Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu told [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=405.8s)]
*  a closed-door parliamentary session of his Likud party colleagues that he supported what he [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=411.16s)]
*  described as voluntary migration of the Palestinians from Gaza. He added, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=416.04s)]
*  our problem is the countries that are willing to absorb them, and we are working on it. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=421.24s)]
*  That's what he said back in December 2023. Israeli cabinet ministers have repeatedly pushed for so-called [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=426.12s)]
*  voluntary migration, with a confidence on this being attended by 11 cabinet ministers in January [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=432.76s)]
*  2024. Voluntary migration, of course, is a vile nonsense. The people of Gaza do not want to leave [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=439.24s)]
*  their homeland. It is simply a euphemism for ethnic cleansing. And the dream, of course, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=446.36s)]
*  of the Israeli right is to drive them out and then settle Gaza, to colonise Gaza with Israeli [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=451.32s)]
*  settlers. Now Egypt's military dictatorship has repeatedly publicly opposed the ethnic cleansing [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=458.6s)]
*  of Gaza, including in response to Trump's latest comments, but last February, nearly one year ago, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=464.12s)]
*  photos were published showing Egypt was building an enclosed area ringed with high concrete walls [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=470.28000000000003s)]
*  along its border with Gaza. That was discussed as possibly housing Palestinians [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=476.44s)]
*  fleeing the then planned Israeli assault on the southern city of Ra'afah. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=481.0s)]
*  The prospect of driving the people of Gaza from their homeland always loomed large, and yet [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=487.4s)]
*  the Western media overwhelmingly did not take it seriously. Even now, they won't. The BBC tweeted out, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=491.4s)]
*  Palestinians condemn US President Donald Trump's proposal to resettle Gazans abroad and quote [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=498.12s)]
*  unquote, clean out that whole thing. The headline for that piece? Trump wants neighbours to take [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=503.71999999999997s)]
*  in Palestinians to clean out Gaza. Nothing, zero about ethnic cleansing there, just outrageous [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=510.28s)]
*  euphemisms. But today with the ceasefire in place, however temporarily, the Palestinian people are [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=516.28s)]
*  returning on mass to their homes in northern Gaza. Listen to this Palestinian who is amongst those [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=520.76s)]
*  returning in vast numbers. Thousands of them are deciding to return by walking on the beach, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=526.76s)]
*  on the disavowed beach. We are coming Gaza by walking or by even running. Let's go. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=538.84s)]
*  And this Palestinian woman who says Trump is dreaming if he thinks any of us will go to Egypt [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=550.76s)]
*  or Jordan. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=563.3199999999999s)]
*  Indeed, the sight of Palestinians returning to their homes as described by Farah Israeli [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=580.76s)]
*  politician Itamar Ben-Ghavir until recently Minister of National Security, like so, the opening of the [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=591.3199999999999s)]
*  Net-Sarim Highway this morning and the entry of tens of thousands of Gazans into the northern [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=597.4s)]
*  Gaza Strip are images of Hamas' victory, and another humiliating part of the reckless deal. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=602.04s)]
*  This is not what quote unquote complete victory looks like. This is what complete surrender looks [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=607.56s)]
*  like. The heroic IDF soldiers did not fight and give their lives in the Strip to make these images [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=612.3599999999999s)]
*  possible. We must return to war and destroy. Now I should also note that the British Prime Minister [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=617.3199999999999s)]
*  Keir Starmer spoke to Trump by phone and praised him for securing the landmark ceasefire and [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=623.16s)]
*  hostages deal in Gaza with obviously no condemnation or even concerns expressed about the proposed [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=627.8s)]
*  ethnic cleansing of Gaza. Now as Omar Bartov, the Israeli American professor of genocide studies [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=633.4s)]
*  told me in an interview towards the beginning of this horror, the line between ethnic cleansing [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=640.4399999999999s)]
*  and genocide is blurred in that people do not wish to be ethnically cleansed and in response to that [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=645.9599999999999s)]
*  resistance, that refusal comes genocide. Gaza has been made deliberately inhospitable for human [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=650.76s)]
*  life. A statistic I often refer to is how 83% of plant life has been destroyed in Gaza. That [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=656.76s)]
*  sums it up. This is a deliberate and systematic attempt by the Israeli state to rid themselves [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K0cMEg1cNE&t=663.72s)]
