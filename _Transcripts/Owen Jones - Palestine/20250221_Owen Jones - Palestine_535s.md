# Israel Drops GENOCIDAL Leaflets On Gaza: They're Not Even Hiding It
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [February 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70)
*  This is chilling, I should warn you. Utterly disturbing. Now, you may ask reasonably if [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=0.0s)]
*  it's possible to still be disturbed by anything that the Israeli state does to the Palestinian [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=5.76s)]
*  people. Well, I would implore you, never stop being shocked, because otherwise we unwittingly [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=10.4s)]
*  normalise the depravity currently being facilitated by Western governments. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=15.76s)]
*  The Israeli army has often dropped leaflets on Gaza as part of its campaign [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=20.8s)]
*  of psychological warfare. Well, some new leaflets have just been dropped. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=25.6s)]
*  They feature a picture of US President Donald Trump alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=29.68s)]
*  a wanted man who has an arrest warrant against him issued by the International Criminal Court [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=35.6s)]
*  for war crimes and crimes against humanity. It has been translated by Jehad Abbasalim, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=40.96s)]
*  a Palestinian writer. Let me just read it out to you. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=46.64s)]
*  To the Honourable people of Gaza, after the events have taken place, the temporary ceasefire, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=51.199999999999996s)]
*  and before the implementation of Trump's mandatory plan which will impose forced displacement upon you, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=55.919999999999995s)]
*  whether you accept it or not, we have decided to make one final appeal to those who wish to receive [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=62.64s)]
*  aid in exchange for cooperating with us. We will not hesitate for a moment to provide assistance. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=67.52s)]
*  Reconsider your position. The world map will not change if all the people of Gaza cease to exist. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=74.4s)]
*  No one will feel for you. No one will ask about you. You have been left alone to face your [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  inevitable fate. Iran cannot even protect itself, let alone protect you. And you have seen with your [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=87.76s)]
*  own eyes what has happened. Neither America nor Europe care about Gaza in any way. Even your Arab [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  countries which are now our allies provide us with money and weapons while sending you only [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=101.12s)]
*  shrouds. There is little time left. The game is almost over. Whoever wishes to save themselves [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=106.16000000000001s)]
*  before it's too late, we are here, remaining until the end of time. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=112.0s)]
*  Let me refer back to what was said by Raz Segal, the brilliant Israeli-American associate professor [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=118.0s)]
*  of Holocaust and genocide studies, on the 13th of October, 2023, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=124.8s)]
*  at the very beginning of this genocidal mayhem. He wrote the following, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=130.79999999999998s)]
*  Israel's genocidal assault on Gaza is quite explicit, open and unashamed. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=135.51999999999998s)]
*  Perpetrators of genocide usually do not express their intentions so clearly [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=141.28s)]
*  that there are exceptions. You see, what he's saying there is normally states do commit [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=145.6s)]
*  criminal acts, indeed genocide, and they go in the overwhelming number of cases to great lengths [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  to cover up what they're doing. Not so with the Israeli state in this genocide. Its leaders, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=158.8s)]
*  its officials, its soldiers, its media outlets, its journalists, its ordinary citizens have [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=165.68s)]
*  relentlessly and shamelessly articulated their genocidal intent from day one. This leaflet is [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=170.24s)]
*  a confession of grave war crimes. In this leaflet, the Israeli state tries to terrify [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=176.16s)]
*  Palestinian citizens into collaborating with an Israeli state which has wiped Gaza out, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=181.2s)]
*  slaughtered and maimed their loved ones, inflicted grave injury and trauma on them, starved them. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=186.56s)]
*  It suggests that if they do not collaborate with the Israeli state, then they're going to die. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=192.56s)]
*  It states, the world map will not change. If all the people of Gaza cease to exist, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=197.92s)]
*  no one will feel for you and no one will ask about you. This is not even subtle in its genocidal [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=203.52s)]
*  intent. It is discussing there the total extermination of the people of Gaza and states [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=209.84s)]
*  that if they are all exterminated, then they will all be forgotten. Now, we are told that we should [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=215.76000000000002s)]
*  resist comparisons between the behavior of Israel and the behavior of the Nazis, and I've always [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=222.72s)]
*  done that. Yet, I would just say this, who could read those lines and not recall if they were aware [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=227.28s)]
*  of these words I'm about to state, what was said by Adolf Hitler in 1939, because he said, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=235.84s)]
*  who after all speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians? Could somebody explain [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=245.04s)]
*  the material difference between what this leaflet written by the Israeli authorities [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=252.88s)]
*  and addressed the people of Gaza, the difference between this leaflet and what was said by the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=260.08s)]
*  Nazi leader 86 years ago? The leaflet refers to Trump's mandatory plan, which will impose [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=264.96s)]
*  forced displacement upon you, whether you accept it or not. Well, here Israel's sense of impunity [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=270.56s)]
*  is clearly overwhelming. Forced displacement is just a war crime. It's an objective war crime. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=275.04s)]
*  It's also a war crime which can only take place with hideous levels of violence and death. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=279.52s)]
*  You see, the people of Gaza don't want to leave their land. The vast majority of them are the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=284.4s)]
*  relatives of those who were forced to flee what is now Israel when it was founded over three [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=288.24s)]
*  quarters of a century ago. They were forced to flee then and never allowed to return. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=292.32s)]
*  The Israeli army will only be able to drive people out of Gaza by using violence far more intense [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=297.03999999999996s)]
*  than the violence already unleashed, which you may struggle to even imagine. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=302.0s)]
*  And note as Antony Blinken, the former US Secretary of State, conceded last month before [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=306.4s)]
*  Donald Trump assumed the presidency, he said the following, we assess that Hamas has recruited [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=312.8s)]
*  almost as many militants as it has lost, adding that as a recipe for enduring insurgency and [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=317.2s)]
*  perpetual war. You see, if you butcher people, if you slaughter them and leave them with no hope [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=322.32s)]
*  whatsoever, then clearly you will provide endless recruits because of the loved ones who wish to [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=327.12s)]
*  avenge the slaughter of their children, their parents, their lovers. We could go on. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=335.12s)]
*  An attempt to forcibly remove the Palestinian people from their homeland will trigger mass [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=343.6s)]
*  armed resistance, which Israel will respond to with even more depraved violence, and based [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=347.52s)]
*  on their past behaviour, that will be combined with a total siege on the means of life, food, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=352.0s)]
*  energy, fuel, water, shelter. We could go on. Just today, the brilliant Palestinian journalist [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=356.56s)]
*  Hossam Shabbat tweets, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=361.28s)]
*  Beit Hanoun village is completely destroyed. They did not receive the slightest humanitarian aid, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=363.2s)]
*  and the families live in tense and difficult humanitarian conditions amidst the destruction, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=367.67999999999995s)]
*  defying all displacement projects. Drinking water is not available, whether it's possible or not. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=372.32s)]
*  That's now, that's where the ceasefire in place, a ceasefire which is supposed to allow [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=377.84s)]
*  humanitarian aid in, which Israel, in terms of its agreement, keeps violating in terms of allowing [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=382.79999999999995s)]
*  humanitarian aid. We do not know how many Palestinians have been directly killed by [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=389.84s)]
*  Israeli violence and indirectly by being deprived of food, water, energy, shelter, medical attention, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=394.0s)]
*  and so on, but some estimate it to be hundreds of thousands. Notably, Donald Trump keeps referring [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=399.76s)]
*  to how all the people of Gaza will be deported, which he says means probably 1.7 million, maybe [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=404.47999999999996s)]
*  1.8 million. But Gaza's pre-war population was around 2.3 million, which suggests he has received [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=409.76s)]
*  intelligence estimates that hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have been killed since this [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=415.44s)]
*  genocide began. Their violent deporting, this violent deporting of an entire people, would kill [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=419.28s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of people on top of the number who've already been killed. It is worth [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=426.32s)]
*  just returning to what was written in that leaflet. The leaflet tries to make Palestinians give up all [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=431.28s)]
*  hope by telling them that nobody cares about them, that they've been completely abandoned. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=435.67999999999995s)]
*  And it is true the Arab dictatorships have done nothing meaningful to save the Palestinians from [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=440.15999999999997s)]
*  their hideous fate, and it is also true that western states such as Britain have armed and [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=444.16s)]
*  facilitated this genocide. But to the people of Gaza, hundreds of millions, billions of people [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=450.56s)]
*  with you, the polling in countries like here in Britain is clear. The polling shows that the [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=456.0s)]
*  large majority think Israel is guilty of war crimes, think we should end all arms sales, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=460.40000000000003s)]
*  and that Benjamin Netanyahu should be arrested. Millions of people have been changed forever [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=464.24s)]
*  by you, and we are not going to give up on the Palestinian people come what may. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=469.28000000000003s)]
*  Never feel you are alone or abandoned because so many of us are with you to the very end, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=473.68s)]
*  and will not stop until our government cease facilitating the hideous fate being opposed upon [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=479.04s)]
*  you, and will not stop until there is a free Palestine. That leaflet will one day be presented [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=483.68s)]
*  to the courts as just another piece of damning evidence about the criminal and genocidal intent [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=488.16s)]
*  of Israel. It will also be offered up as yet more evidence that there was no excuses for not knowing [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=492.48s)]
*  what Israel's intent was, and that therefore the western politicians who armed and facilitated [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=498.72s)]
*  this abomination will also face their day in court as well. Please like and subscribe, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhKLxWEGA70&t=503.04s)]
