# Why Israel's Onslaught Is DOOMED
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [November 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdSz8ESXTzg)
*  There are so many tragedies wrapped into this overall catastrophe, the catastrophe of course
*  being unleashed against the people of Gaza by Israel, that it is difficult to know where to start.
*  But here's one, and it's been nagging at me. It's the absolute crushing certainty that not only
*  will this human catastrophe kill so many innocent people, and maim and traumatise so many more,
*  but that it will fail on its own terms. How do we know this? Well, for a start, history.
*  Now, history is not a perfect guide, but it is the only real guide that we have. The tragedy
*  about the cliché, those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it, is that it's
*  obviously been said enough to achieve cliché status without its actual lesson being absorbed.
*  Now, this week I was on television with Liam Fox, a conservative MP, who backs every single
*  catastrophic military intervention and indeed was defence secretary during the war in Libya.
*  Let me, let's hear me put that to him. Look, I have to say this, let's just be pretty honest.
*  People like yourself brought us Afghanistan, you said anyone who criticised what, well, the
*  occupation that went on for two decades were Taliban Stooges, and we ended up with the Taliban
*  stronger than ever. The same with Iraq, we were told we were Stooges and Saddam Hussein, we had
*  the blood and chaos and hundreds of thousands of people and Islamist extremism on the rampage.
*  You gave us Libya, we got a failed state. Each time, are you going to say anything about
*  or are we just going to get this teenage hysterical rant? It's not teenage hysteria to use historical
*  precedent to point out that every single time we have been told these military onslaughts are
*  necessary, they end in a greater catastrophe and there's no basis for counterinsurgency
*  programmes succeeding in this way. No substance whatsoever, which is exactly what we'd expect.
*  Well, you don't like your record being obviously distorted because you know it's going to be the
*  same with the counter. I'm really sorry and I know that you two have got so much to say to each other,
*  maybe you can go and have a drink after the programme and fight it out in the pub.
*  Let's have a drink during the week. You probably spot there how he got personal
*  rather than address the actual substance of what I was saying. Now to quote the idol of Liam Fox,
*  Margaret Thatcher, I always cheer up immensely if one is particularly wound in an argument that is
*  because I think well if they attack one personally it means they have not a single political argument
*  left. That's why my father always taught me never worry about anyone attacking you personally,
*  it means that arguments carry no weight and they know it. Right Liam? Don't get used to me
*  approvingly quoting Margaret Thatcher by the way. Where are the lies in terms of what I said though?
*  Where's the dishonesty in terms of what I said? Should we deal with Afghanistan first? The history
*  of course of the West there was backing the Mujahideen in the 1980s against the Soviets,
*  didn't exactly pan out that well, which has a parallel given Israel intentionally boosted
*  Hamas, Benjamin Netanyahu did so as Haaretz, the Israeli newspaper put it, he was quoted as saying
*  that you should support them and give funds to them and that will stop a viable Palestinian state
*  ever being possible. Now our Saudi allies allowed their wealthy citizens to fund the Taliban when
*  it was in power. As the author and Afghanistan expert Anand Gopal put it to me back in 2021,
*  the Taliban all but evaporated in 2001. Now there's a difference with Hamas now because there is no
*  chance of Hamas simply evaporating in the way that the Taliban did. But you see what happened next,
*  Afghan politicians and the new government exploited a US desire to eliminate so-called bad guys by
*  falsely claiming their supporters were Taliban, their opponents were Taliban supporters. Massacres,
*  mass arrests, house raids and torture ensued. Pro-government forces recruited kids even as
*  soldiers where the Afghan local police murdered civilians engaged in theft, kidnapping and just
*  various atrocities. Now the CIA backed coast protection force oversaw similar human rights
*  abuses. Their victims ranged from 14-year-old boys to 60-year-old tribal elders. As human rights
*  put it, a central myth was that Afghan strongmen, warlords and commanders of US troops that are
*  allies to the Taliban could help to provide security and stability despite their records of
*  abuses and again they committed numerous atrocities against civilians. And you had Afghan detention
*  centres packed with prisoners who were beaten, suffocated and subjected to electric shocks.
*  And according to the International Criminal Court, the US Armed Forces and CIA may have committed
*  war crimes by torturing detainees. The Afghan expert Gopal tells me there are dozens of Abu
*  graves in Afghanistan that went unreported. Air strikes killed thousands of civilians
*  and were followed by what Human Rights Watch described as poor investigations and infrequent
*  condolence payments. According to the UN data, in the last five years of Western involvement in
*  Afghanistan, 40% of all civilian casualties from air strikes were children. Sounds familiar
*  that doesn't it? Between 2017 and 2020, the civilian deaths of Western bombs surged by more
*  than 300%. So the atrocities committed by the West and its allies were instrumental in reviving the
*  fortunes of the Taliban. So was mass corruption etc. But the point is, is these atrocities committed
*  by the West helped drive people into the arms of a political movement that actually was completely
*  on its knees in 2001, unlike Hamas. What about Iraq? Now, people I think are more commonly
*  familiar with the catastrophe, well certainly earlier on. The invasion of course based on a
*  false pretext. I remember when I was at Oxford before the invasion, the general coming in and
*  saying that 99% of the Iraqi population would be celebrating and throwing flowers at troops,
*  the other 1% would be too scared to come out, but soon would join in the celebrations. Didn't
*  exactly pan out like that from what I recall. Now when the US went in, they massacred innocent
*  people at for example Fallujah, a very important city in Iraq, mostly of sunny Iraqi citizenship.
*  The consequence of those early massacres, well that drove people into the arms of insurgents.
*  Fallujah became a citadel of insurgents against the US occupation. You see, you slaughter people,
*  what you do is you leave behind people who aren't just grief-stricken but angry. And that's what
*  happened in Fallujah. It was a microcosm and in 2004 the US engaged in horrible destruction of
*  that city and indeed used white phosphorus against civilian populations, which again Iraq,
*  sorry Israel are accused of doing today. There was the dismiss of the Iraqi army,
*  suddenly lots of people without guns were angry and driven to the arms of insurgents.
*  We were told our collie does attack on the twin towers was the basis for the Iraqi invasion,
*  but they had almost no presence in Iraq before that invasion. Now Iraq became their playground,
*  a brutal counterinsurgency program in the 2000s ensued that was seen as successful.
*  Al Qaeda was defeated. Surely you couldn't get anything worse than Al Qaeda. Oopsie daisy,
*  a failure of imagination. Now as my friend Mehdi Hassan, the political journalist puts it,
*  the shootings, the torture, the general chaos all helped drive thousands of Iraqis from the
*  minority sunny community into the arms of radical groups led by brutal gangsters such as Al Zakawe.
*  He was the ringleader of Al Qaeda in Iraq which ended up as the precursor to ISIS.
*  Mass incarceration, tens of thousands of Iraqis, horribly treated, that was also radicalised,
*  crucial in terms of radicalisation. Now I mean it should be pointed out that they drew their support
*  from the minority sunny population in Iraq, but we're talking here about the vast majority of the
*  Palestinians obviously. Almost all Palestinians in Gaza are viscerally, bitterly opposed to
*  Israel's treatment of the Palestinian people. Hamas is more embedded in the local population
*  than either Taliban or Al Qaeda because the secular movements which embraced peace were
*  brutally undermined by Israel. They ended up with nothing to show for abandoning the armed struggle.
*  It's a political idea. You can't just wipe out some Hamas, Qaeda and Hey Presto. It vanishes.
*  It remains in existence as an idea. We saw in Iraq and Afghanistan how the brutality led to
*  foundations for what came next and actually the brutality, the concentration of brutality, is much
*  worse in Gaza than it was in Iraq and Afghanistan. Not to belittle the terrible crimes committed by
*  the West in both Iraq and Afghanistan, but in much bigger countries with much bigger populations
*  than the 2.2 million or so in Gaza who are facing concentrated firepower in a very small area the
*  size of East London. Now these people responsible, the architects of these catastrophes, walk from
*  crime scene to crime scene drenched in blood demanding yet more blood, acting as though they
*  haven't been completely discredited by the catastrophes they cheered on and indeed were
*  responsible for which claimed millions of lives according to a study by Brown University into the
*  post 9-11 wars and indeed as well so many UK and US service personnel. So with this counter-insurgency
*  program the prospects are even less favorable. There's the context of decades of Palestinians
*  driven from their homes, being occupied, besieged, their land stolen and settled on
*  the apartheid diagnosed by Human Rights Watch and the City National and the Israeli human rights
*  organization Betzalem. There are people being massacred by the Israeli army and the settlers
*  for so many years. The brutality here, as I said, is even worse. You will end up with a grief-striken
*  oppressed people with absolutely nothing to lose whatsoever. How do you think that's going to pan
*  out? Just realistically, just use your basic common sense and look at the precedents. I also mentioned
*  Libya of course. Every single military intervention this lot have given us has been a catastrophe.
*  But Iraq and Afghanistan are a particular pertinent. You think, you know, what else will be
*  created here? Think about it. What will be created other than land where all the people have been
*  brutalized? They've lost loved ones. Do you really think they'll accept being even more persecuted
*  and oppressed and they'll embrace Israel, particularly given Israel is talking of a permanent
*  occupation of Gaza under a far-right government in Israel, stuffed full of people who do not think
*  that Palestinians are humans and are open about wanting to kill and oppress and steal their land?
*  It's obvious how it ends, not just in bloodshed but with Palestinians driven ever further into
*  the arms of quote unquote extremism. I'll put my reputation on the line. This is going to be a
*  catastrophe just as all these other monstrous horrible interventions were catastrophes. We let
*  them get away with it those other times and I really do think we have to learn. We can't let them
*  keep getting away with this. Please like, subscribe, do support us on patreon.com
