# Israel Just Massacred Starving Palestinians Trying To Get Flour
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [February 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH0XV-ucBmc)
*  Words. That's my job. Speaking words, writing words, talking about the world around us,
*  trying to make sense of events, injustices, horrors in accordance with my principle. That's
*  my job. I do these videos, I try and sketch out before what to say, but it becomes harder
*  and harder because one of the great crimes of our age, Israel's genocide war on Gaza,
*  is happening every day before us, every day, live streamed to us on our phones, on our computers.
*  One of the great crimes of our age, as they say. New horrors, new atrocities, new crimes,
*  yet most of our political and media establishments are complicit. They could stop this, but they
*  don't. Instead, they try and betray those of us who oppose this slaughter, whose horror will
*  scream down the ages as being the real extremists who need to be silenced. It's enough sometimes
*  to make you feel like you're going mad. But we can't do that. And we owe it to the people of
*  Gaza to keep speaking and to keep using our words. Today, the Israeli army massacred desperate
*  starving Palestinians as they tried to get flour off an aid truck to feed their loved ones or
*  those loved ones who have survived. It's believed that well over a hundred, maybe a hundred and
*  fifty, maybe more were killed and many hundreds wounded. Here's what happened. Gaza is starving
*  to death, as I'll explain, because the Israeli state is deliberately starving its people to death.
*  Israel has blocked humanitarian aid getting into northern Gaza since the 23rd of January. Today,
*  as some aid trucks containing flour arrived, Israeli tanks and drones started shooting at
*  people who were desperately trying to get some food, some flour for their families. And then,
*  of course, those who survived, or those who weren't shot and killed began to flee. According to Al
*  Jazeera, Israeli tanks advanced and ran over many of the dead and injured bodies. Ambulances
*  couldn't reach the area, so the dead and injured were carried on trucks taken to hospitals which
*  are barely functioning, lacking fuel, medicine, they have no blood. The IDF then thrashed around
*  trying to invent reasons for what had happened. Here's three of them. There's three different
*  explanations we're hearing from the IDF so far. Initially, it was that there was a stampede that
*  caused loads of people to die. Then there was a suggestion that a truck had actually driven by
*  a civilian driver, had mown down a load to the Palestinians. Then there was a suggestion that
*  this was potentially Hamas stealing the aid. The IDF originally denied cheating its civilians at
*  all, claimed it was a stampede. It was now, obviously, became impossible to justify,
*  given the wounds of the dead and injured were clearly caused by ammunition. So they then issued
*  a statement claiming that those starving Palestinians constituted a violent gathering,
*  which made its soldiers feel unsafe as they indiscriminately opened fire on them.
*  Now, to be clear, their claim that they felt threatened was about being threatened by starving,
*  desperate, emaciated Palestinians. Multiple sources and eyewitness reports said these radio
*  troops started a firing and indeed I watched the videos where you can quite clearly hear
*  Palestinians fleeing, shots ringing through the air. I'd share them, but unfortunately YouTube has
*  a habit of age-restricting videos with that kind of footage and thus collapsing their audiences.
*  As the courageous Israeli human rights organisation Betsalem report, the residents of Gaza are
*  starving due to the humanitarian crisis Israel has intentionally created in the Gaza Strip.
*  Their attempts to access the scarce aid allowed in led this morning to the deaths of dozens of
*  people after soldiers fired into the crowd. Whether they were shot or trampled to death,
*  intentionally opening fire on civilians is a severe violation of international law
*  and constitutes a war crime. This is especially grave given a crowd of thousands begging for aid.
*  This has become known as the Flower Massacre. Say those two words aloud. Flower Massacre.
*  A massacre of Palestinian civilians trying to get flour for their families. Now Israel has starved
*  these people. As those few aid trucks with some flour arrived they massacred them as they tried
*  to feed themselves and their families. Why is this happening? Because the Israelis don't know they
*  can get away with anything. Listen to the Israeli National Security Minister Itamir Ben-Gavir.
*  Here's how he responded to this mass slaughter of innocent people.
*  Total support must be given to our heroic fighters operating in Gaza who acted excellently against
*  the Gazan mob that tried to harm them. Today it was proven that the transfer of humanitarian aid
*  to Gaza is not only madness while our abductees are being held in the strip under substandard
*  conditions but also endangers the IDF soldiers. This is another clear reason why we must stop
*  transferring this aid which is in fact aid to harm the IDF soldiers and oxygen to Hamas.
*  That's quite right what you just listened to there. That's correct in terms of a translation.
*  You're not being deceived. Your ears aren't deceiving you. That's what he said. Israel has
*  prevented food from getting into Gaza, starved its people and then when it massacres some of
*  those desperate people Israel's equivalent of their home secretary he didn't just admit it he
*  celebrated it he rejoiced and then he said this shows all aid should be stopped from getting into
*  Gaza altogether. Now in Israel telegram groups are ecstatic. Here's one example. First footage of the
*  blessed massacre you can see clearly they're fighting for their lives for survival. Cannibalism
*  is on the way. We must starve them until the longer-awaited cannibalism.
*  Have you ever wondered what happens when a society is overwhelmed by genocidal mania?
*  Well now you know. As Belgium's deputy prime minister has tweeted horrified by the news of
*  today's massacre of over 100 Palestinian citizens murdering people queuing for essential humanitarian
*  aid this is a flagrant violation of international humanitarian law and goes fully against the ICJ's
*  provisional measures. Indeed you can only conclude this is part of Israel's genocidal strategy.
*  Massacre those looking for food and you will deter them from doing so in future. Here's the context.
*  Famine. Famine which is deliberate and calculated. Listen to this for Melanie Ward the CEO of Medical
*  Aid for Palestine and I warn you it's grim. Just explain first why viewers why aid isn't being
*  allowed in. Where is the aid? It's very simple it's because the Israeli military won't let it in.
*  We could end this starvation tomorrow very simply if they would just let us have access to people
*  there but but it's not being allowed. This is what they said on the 7th of October nothing will go in
*  and and so it remains the case and for people in the north of Gaza it's even worse because no food
*  is reaching them anymore and so my own staff my own colleague Abir has been eating animal feed and
*  horrifyingly the food that they were eating which is food for horse and donkeys is now running out
*  and now they're eating bird seed. The statistics also tell their own story one in six children
*  under the age of two in the north of Gaza are now acutely malnourished. This is the fastest decline
*  in a population's nutrition status ever recorded and what that means is that children are being
*  starved at the fastest rate the world has ever seen and we could finish it tomorrow we could
*  save them all but we're not being able to. Process that for a moment I'll repeat I'll repeat I'll
*  repeat this is the fastest decline in a population's nutrition status ever recorded that means children
*  are being starved at the fastest rate the world has ever seen. Are those complicit in this? Not
*  just by actively supporting this so by which point anyone in that camp should be judged as beyond
*  depraved but those who are silent aren't they not feeling any shame listening to those words? I would
*  die of shame myself. Keep reminding yourselves this is all deliberate what you're hearing this
*  humanitarian calamity indeed a quarter of Gaza's population are one step from famine while one in
*  six children under two are suffering from acute malnutrition and wasting that's where the body
*  becomes emaciated. According to the UN special rapporteur and the writer of food this is deliberate
*  starvation by Israel and thus is genocidal and yet you have the White House now examining options
*  to begin air dropping food into Gaza instead of using that actual leverage over their key ally
*  which is completely dependent on them to get aid in. Now finally just listen to this. The head of
*  the pentagon who says that over 25,000 women and children have been killed in Gaza since the Hamas
*  attacks on Israel on the 7th of October you'll remember that the Hamas from Gaza health ministry
*  announced today that over 30,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the 7th of October attacks
*  while the pentagon now saying that 25,000 women and children are known to have been killed. Ever
*  since this horror began we have heard non-stop atrocity denial that the official numbers or the
*  number who have been slaughtered in Gaza are a lie of the seat we can't trust the Hamas run health
*  ministry and they keep blazing that don't they Hamas run health ministry Hamas health ministry so
*  you don't believe what they say even though all the figures the death figures in previous conflict
*  released by that ministry have been correct even though earlier on in this horror they released all
*  the names and details and Israel aside IDs of the dead to prove they were in fact dead
*  even though the prestigious Lancet medical journal confirmed the figures as accurate even though aid
*  agencies on the ground keep confirming these figures even though the official death figures
*  of more than 30,000 killed is a drastic underestimate because it excludes those buried
*  under the rubble many many thousands were classed as missing even though most are long long dead
*  and may never be identified even though the hospitals have ceased functioning as society
*  has collapsed so much that many deaths are not being reported even though only violent deaths
*  are reported and included in those figures not those for example starving to death or dying of
*  preventable medical conditions now the pentagon saying 25,000 women and children killed that
*  excludes the men who were innocent many thousands of men are innocent just because you're a man
*  over 18 doesn't mean you are competent and a new study has found that by august on the current
*  trajectory one in 20 of the entire population will have been killed this is one of the great
*  atrocities of our time you've read in the history books about all the atrocities
*  and you were shocked i hope when you read about them you're living through one now and you can
*  see how they happen and how so many become actively complicit and i know what's going to happen
*  so obvious what's going to happen isn't it in years to come nobody will admit that they supported
*  the massacre of gaza and this atrocity and those who were silent will claim that they actually spoke
*  out but we know different don't we we know different so few spoke out and so many were silent
*  and so many actively supported this horror even though it was clear from the very beginning
*  based on what israeli leaders and officials said what they were going to do no excuses so we've
*  got to keep speaking out those who did this and continue to do this mustn't be able to get away
*  they have to be held to account because otherwise if this is allowed to go to happen
*  this massacre this genocide and there's no accountability then we might as well all give up
*  because any horror will be possible after this and far worse will be to come please like and
*  subscribe share this on this video or podcast however you listen to it and our speeches
