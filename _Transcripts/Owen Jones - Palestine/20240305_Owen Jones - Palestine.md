# Israel's Latest SHOCKING Lies Exposed
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [March 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgWdFvKIyg)
*  The modus operandi of Israel's authorities goes like this. Your forces commit a terrible crime,
*  for which there is ample overwhelming evidence. Your spokespeople and outriders then take to
*  social media and the airwaves to deny what's happened, to lie, to deflect, to muddy the waters,
*  to cast doubt. And then you hope that you've caused enough confusion that by the time the
*  outrage has died down, that enough people are left baffled, confused, unsure and that other than
*  your diehard opponents, everyone stops scrutinising you for what you've actually done.
*  That's combined with the approach of writing out each atrocity you commit,
*  knowing you have impunity, that Western states will keep arming and supporting you, using their
*  diplomatic muscle in your aid, and Western media outlets will keep whitewashing and ignoring your
*  crimes, ensuring the horrors you commit are normalised. Remember early on in this horror
*  show when Al-Shifa hospital was bombed and there was a non-stop controversy about who bombed it.
*  Was it Israel or was it a misfired Islamic jihad rocket? The basis of the controversy
*  was that it was understood that attacking hospitals represents a grave war crime. That's
*  why Israel was so keen to deny responsibility. So what happened after that? Israel attacked
*  every single hospital and health facility in Gaza, all 36 of them, rendering most of them
*  inoperable, slaughtering doctors, nurses, patients and it all just became normalised. There was no
*  need for any controversy about whether a misfired rocket was involved in all of these horrors.
*  Which brings me on to the so-called Flower Massacre. What a phrase to have to utter.
*  A massacre of desperate Palestinians queuing for flour as they and their families
*  starve, as famine stalks the land. An artificial famine, a famine imposed by the Israeli state,
*  by their siege, combined with the apocalyptic levels of destruction,
*  enlistigates Gaza by the Israeli state, causing the fastest decline in a population's nutrition
*  status ever recorded, meaning, as medical aid for Palestinians puts it, that children are being
*  starved at the fastest rate the world has ever seen. What does that mean in practice?
*  20% of households facing an extreme lack of food, 30% of kids suffering from acute malnutrition,
*  while at least 20 children have died of hunger so far, the very beginnings of a famine.
*  While at the same time the UN says that 80% of families in Gaza lack clean water. That's the
*  context for what happened. Last week on the 29th of February, when more than 110 Palestinians were
*  killed and hundreds wounded after over a month of Israel preventing any aid reaching northern Gaza,
*  a convoy arrived where starving Palestinians had gathered nearby the sea. Now let's be clear,
*  the Israeli state massacred these Palestinians. Let's just be so abundantly clear about this on
*  the outset. Now I accurately summed up Al Jazeera's article on this massacre. I tweeted out,
*  the Israeli army just massacred over 100 Palestinians as they tried to get flour
*  for their families. Israeli tanks then ran over the dead and injured bodies. The Israeli state
*  is committing these atrocities knowing it can get away with anything. That is indeed how Al Jazeera
*  correctly reported this massacre. The Nilean Levy, the shameless official spokesperson for
*  the Israeli government, a propagandist whose job it is to defend a murderous onslaught against
*  Gaza defined by multiple war crimes, quote treated that with,
*  Blood libel, those poor people were killed when they were crushed in a stampede and in some cases
*  run over by the Gazan truck drivers as they tried to get out. But go ahead blame Israel.
*  Blood libel. Let's just take that on, shall we? What blood libel refers to is one of the forms
*  antisemitism, a great evil, has taken through the ages. Back in the middle ages, Jews were falsely
*  accused of ritualized murders, particularly of children. To be clear, these blood libels,
*  as the term suggests, were false. Just wasn't true. These Jews were not going around killing
*  children in ritualized murders. It was a lie which was used to justify the horrors inflicted
*  against Jewish people. What the likes of Eid al-Levi is doing here is deliberately conflating
*  the state of Israel with Jewish people, including ordinary Jewish people, something you should not
*  do. Unbelievably irresponsible, not least when the state of Israel is very clearly committing
*  horrendous war crimes. In cases like this, we're not dealing with fictional deaths
*  that haven't actually happened, unlike the claims falsely made against ordinary Jewish civilians.
*  Not a military superpower and an armed state engaged in the objective mass destruction
*  of Gaza which entails colossal numbers of deaths. No one disputes that mass death is taking place.
*  Now this attempt to strip anti-Semitism of its meaning is so irresponsible given anti-Semitism
*  is real and growing and needs to be confronted. He's an idiot. Now by the way, what kind of win
*  does this man think he's got by using a defense of we starved the Palestinian population of northern
*  Gaza so much that given some are wasting away whilst eating animal feed in order to survive,
*  the first appearance of food for weeks triggers a desperate stampede. Horrific on its own terms,
*  but not actually true in terms of how they died. Now what's also striking is Eid al-Levi originally
*  posted then deleted. Let's set the record straight. IDF soldiers did not shoot at the convoy.
*  IDF soldiers did not shoot at people looting the trucks. IDF forces used fire when masses ran
*  towards them in a way that threatened their lives. They were there in the first place to secure the
*  convoy. So originally he admits Israeli soldiers did shoot, blood libel anyone, with the preposterous
*  suggestion that unarmed, starving Palestinians posed a threat to armed Israeli soldiers. Now
*  analysis by BBC Verify, the fact checkers of the corporation, found that the video released by the
*  IDF is edited into four sections, so not one single sequence. So the IDF did not release the complete
*  footage. They released four separate clips and I have to say what they did intentionally is
*  introduce it in a way that made the Palestinians, desperate starving Palestinians, look like ants.
*  The way it was edited was completely unnecessary. Now in other words what they did is they edited it
*  in a way that it does not show what actually happened. That would just need one sequence.
*  They then, BBC Verify, also examined exclusive Al Jazeera footage which showed clearly volleys
*  of gunfire as people scrambled over lorries. They quote a journalist, Mahmoud Awadieh, who says
*  Israelis purposefully fired at the men. They were trying to get near the trucks that had the flower.
*  They were fired directly and prevented people to come near those killed. They then quote Dr. Mohamed
*  Salah, interim hospital manager at Al-Oder hospital where many of the dead and injured were taken,
*  who says that the hospital received around 176 injured people. 142 of these cases are bullet
*  injuries and the rest are from the stampede and broken limbs in the upper and lower body parts.
*  So overwhelmingly according to the medics who received the victims, the injuries were caused
*  by bullets. The rest from a stampede inevitably caused by an army firing bullets at civilians.
*  They then note, BBC Verify, the statements by the IDF which repeatedly claim that Gazans were
*  injured as a result of what they call pushing and trampling, the IDF spokesmen suddenly declaring
*  that a mob stormed the convoy. Now the excellent Israeli-Palestinian media outlet,
*  Plus 972 magazine, interviewed some of the victims. One young man declares that when the aid trucks
*  eventually arrived at 4.45am before sunrise where crowds of starving Palatines were waiting,
*  he said, I couldn't see the truck. I just saw its lights and people rushing towards it. Suddenly
*  intense gunfire erupted from the Israeli tanks. I got separated from my uncle and cousin. I didn't
*  know what was happening. I just wanted to survive and escape. Everyone was screaming and fleeing.
*  There were bodies on the ground and wounded people crying for help. They refer to quotes from those
*  working at what remains of Gaza's medical system. So as well as the one I quoted there,
*  the director of Kamal Adwan Hospital who told the New York Times it was the same scene at hospitals
*  across Gaza City. So in this, in the New York Times, he said they received the bodies of 12
*  people killed by gunshots and another 100 with bullet wounds. Multiple interviewees in the
*  piece speak of how these starving Palestinians approached the trucks and they were met by the
*  army responding with, to quote, them indiscriminately firing at everyone who was there. Now we've
*  repeated reports of the IDF firing at aid trucks, coordinated these aid trucks previously with the
*  Israeli military and desperate starving Palestinians being shot at. But here's what happened. Israeli
*  spokespeople and their allies lied. They spread lies. They muddied the waters. We have no condemnation
*  from Israel's allies. So what then happens? Reports of yet more massacres. On the 3rd of March,
*  that is Sunday, another report of dozens being killed and wounded at the Kuwaiti roundabout in
*  Gaza City as they waited for flour trucks. And today on the 5th of March, again, Palestinians
*  under fire in Gaza City, again, waiting for aid trucks from IDF soldiers. Now bear in mind,
*  Western states have financially strangled the main humanitarian agency in Gaza, UNRWA, cutting off
*  funds based on unevidence Israeli claims, which in any case were absurd on their own terms.
*  Allegations of 0.04% of UNRWA's employees being involved in the 7th of October attacks, even if
*  that were true and Israel has refused to offer up the actual evidence, does not justify mass collective
*  punishment. That is a genocidal act by Israel and its Western allies. And belatedly, the EU ended up
*  with storing funds, but only after so much damage had been done. Now, meanwhile, the US Air Force
*  trumpets dropping 38,000 food packages on Gaza. Do you know what that is? It's less than one truck
*  load. It's enough food to give 1.72% of the population a single meal for one day. As if that's
*  compensation for the Israeli states with Western and specifically US support, and it's the US
*  supplying the bombs raining down on Gaza, they are starving Gaza with that connivance of their
*  Western states. And that is a key plank of the genocidal assault against the people of Gaza.
*  But again, the Israeli state lies and lies and lies. Mud is the water and then gets away with
*  its atrocities, only to repeat them all over again. That is why we have to speak out. Please like and
