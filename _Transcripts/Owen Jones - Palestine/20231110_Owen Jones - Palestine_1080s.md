# How YOU Are Smeared For Opposing War Crimes - Protest Leader Ben Jamal Exposes Truth
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [November 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0mtb9oDaKQ)
*  Hello, hello, hello. I am delighted to be joined by Benjamin, who is the director of the Palestine
*  Solidarity Campaign, thus, of course, one of the absolute key leaders of the movement in solidarity
*  with the Palestinian people, obviously, in terms of the decades of oppression, occupation and apartheid,
*  and now specifically the mass slaughter, which is taking place with Israel massacring thousands of
*  innocent people with the support of our government and Western governments. Ben, it's such an honour to
*  have you. Thank you. Thank you. Firstly, I mean, it does strike me, it's just the world turned upside
*  down, the amount of gas lighting whereby the real extremists are the people being betrayed as those
*  who oppose 4,000 plus children being slaughtered. And it's a lot more because there's, unfortunately,
*  lots of bodies trapped in the rubble who aren't counted. And the real moderates are the people who
*  support what the United Nations calls collective punishment and some UN special rapporteurs are
*  calling genocide. What is going on? What's their strategy here? Well, yeah, look, there's, I mean,
*  some of this is very, very familiar to anybody who's been campaigning for Palestinian rights for years,
*  but it's really stark now because of the scale of what we're witnessing. So, you know, anyone who's
*  been in this terrain knows that if you campaign for Palestinian rights, if you try to accurately
*  define what's the nature of Palestinian oppression, if you use appropriate terms like apartheid,
*  if you talk about the Palestinian people's right of return, then you find yourself, you know, accused
*  of support for terrorism. You find yourself accused of antisemitism. You find yourself even
*  accused of having genocidal intents towards all the Jewish people. So those are sort of familiar
*  narratives that have been there for years and they play themselves out whenever we're doing a
*  demonstration. One aspect of that is to try to focus on a small element of people who might attend
*  a large march with a problematic placard and say that's indicative of the entire march.
*  What I think is going on here, though, is the starkness of the situation now because, you know,
*  we're seeing a sort of something quite unprecedented. Very, very early on, I think in the
*  first week when Israel began its indiscriminate bombing, I watched Newsnight and I saw an American
*  political analyst and he wasn't being inhuman. He was given a forensic answer to a question,
*  which was how long do you think it will be before Israel is under serious pressure to cause ceasefire
*  and how many Palestinians do you think might die? And he went through a calculation of how many have
*  been killed in Gaza in 2014 and that was like 2000 Palestinians, 500 children. We use that as a
*  benchmark as an appalling sort of ledger of a scale of suffering. You know, for years I've been
*  referring back to what happened in 2014. He said, well, if you look at that, you look at how many
*  have been killed in the first few days, then I think we're probably talking at least 10 to 20,000
*  deaths before we might get an intervention. And I remember being absolutely chilled and even at that
*  point, with all of my knowledge thinking that's inconceivable, that couldn't happen, that couldn't
*  unfold without our political leaders acting. But instead what we've seen is the same narratives
*  being used that, you know, Israel has a right to defend itself, rhetoric about, of course, everyone
*  has to respect international law, but a complete failure and an inability to answer the question,
*  well, is it, and is this a war crime? One of the worst moments was, of course, Keir Starmer being
*  asked directly, okay, you're telling us you can't say whether this is a violation of international
*  law because you have to wait for a lawyer to tell you. Is it moral? Is it immoral to be doing this?
*  And he said, I can't, I can't make that judgment. So actually what we've seen and underpinning all
*  of that, and I have to say this, is an inherent dehumanizing of the Palestinian people. I've
*  been making the argument, I think, when you're witnessing what we're witnessing, when we know
*  it's going to increase, the only real rationale for saying, I don't think we should have a ceasefire,
*  ultimately, is you think Palestinian lives don't matter, they don't actually count.
*  And then we're, you know, what we're doing is endorsing a sort of rhetoric of what's going on
*  from Israel. You think of what it did at Jabalik camp, where it said, well, we attacked to kill a
*  Hamas commander and the fact that 120 Palestinians died, we now got a new scale of so-called
*  proportionality that we're accepting. We're not accepting it, but our political leaders are saying
*  that's okay. I mean, I have to say one of the things that's just been driving me completely mad,
*  I've worked in the media industry now for 12 years. I'm not naive about the media industry,
*  not naive about the systemic racism that defines this industry. I'm shocked,
*  nonetheless, not surprised actually, but shocked that it's possible to watch such horror,
*  like apocalyptic scenes, and little kids suffering the most horrific deaths.
*  And there's still within most of the media, there isn't a sense of, oh my God, what the hell is
*  happening? This has to stop. I mean, it's, it is, there isn't, it strikes me not a subtlety of
*  a sense of, the media might as well just say, we just don't think Palestinian life matters very much.
*  Yeah, I think, I think that's absolutely true. And it is, as I say, although we're all familiar
*  with this, when you see it unfold in this scale, it's shocking. I've had the experience
*  of recent demonstrations of people coming up to me as we're assembling. I've never experienced
*  this before. People coming up to me, actually grief-stricken, people coming up to me and just
*  weeping. Some I know, some I don't. I think they've seen my media appearances and they're
*  coming up to me and they don't know what to say and they don't know what to do. And in a sense,
*  part of the reason why they're marching is they, they need the reassurance that they're not going
*  mad, that there's a whole body of other people that are witnessing this and seeing this in the
*  same way. And they want to find something they can do to channel that into action to say this
*  has got to stop. So I think that's familiar. The other thing of course that's going on though,
*  is a complete unwillingness to contextualise this. So that if you make an effort to say,
*  the clock didn't stop ticking, it didn't start ticking on October 7th, that there is a history
*  here, then of course you immediately find yourself in an argument, are you justifying what Hamas did?
*  I have to keep going into interviews where I keep having to make the point, I always go to the
*  framework of international law, is it imperfect as it is? So that's the framework we have to use
*  to justify any use of force. International law does say that an oppressed people have a right to
*  defend themselves, including through armed resistance, but it makes clear that the targeting,
*  killing of civilians, taking of hostages are illegal. So you condemn them no matter who does it.
*  But you should be able to say all of that, that say these things don't happen in a vacuum.
*  And part of the narrative that we keep hearing, it's a lie in the Israeli ambassador
*  who says there was a ceasefire up to October 6th, let's push the clock back a tiny bit
*  in the history, let's go back even just as far as January 1st this year, between then and October
*  6th 250 Palestinians, including dozens of children, were killed in the West Bank by Israeli forces and
*  by armed settlers. In one week, in one week in 2023, Israeli settlers set fire to 17
*  Palestinian villages. We have Israeli ministers openly calling, you know, Bezalil Smotrych saying
*  a particular village, Harawa, should be erased from the face of the earth.
*  So that's the idea of a ceasefire, but if we go back to where we need to go back, we've had a
*  decades long military occupation and since 1948, a state established on the process of ethnic
*  cleansing, 750,000 Palestinians, including all of my extended family, forced from their homes.
*  And then the imposition of a system that there's a consensus emerging across international civil
*  society and saying it meets the definition of apartheid. So that's the context in which all of
*  this is occurring. And part of what I would say is, you know, if you build a system of apartheid
*  that's built on the principle that certain people have rights and others don't, you have to
*  dehumanize those to whom you deny rights. And what we're seeing is the almost inevitable,
*  but stark and brutal consequence of that, that you end up justifying and carrying out what we can
*  only describe as an unfolding genocide. But what's appalling, and I think we are all facing, but our
*  political leaders are facing a fundamental moral test, but I think and believe history ought to
*  judge them for, which is what are you doing in this moment as this unfolds? And all of those
*  politicians who at the moment are failing to call for a ceasefire should be held to account.
*  It should be held to account. Very well put. I mean, I'm glad we mentioned just the number who
*  were killed in the West Bank before October the 7th, because the point there, Bas, where people
*  say the ceasefire was broken, is the argument is, do you think the families of those 250 people
*  think that the ceasefire was intact? And that just because if they were Israeli, if they were 250
*  Israeli civilians who'd been killed, then nobody would consider that a ceasefire. And that in itself
*  reveals just how much Palestinians have been dehumanized, because the other way around,
*  if there was five, if there was one Israeli civilian killed, that would be regarded as a
*  ceasefire over. Just in terms of politicians, because we often get this kind of walk to
*  Bower tree trolling, basically, you know, in a world of so much evil, why are you focusing on this?
*  And I had some unfortunate few souls on social media going, why don't you ever talk about Yemen?
*  I've written about 10 columns in Yemen. No columnist has written more about Yemen than I have.
*  I've been to Yemeni refugee camp. The only time I've ever wept on camera was in a Yemeni refugee
*  camp. But you know, that is a bloodbath in which perhaps 15,000 civilians have been killed by Saudi
*  airstrikes over several years in a country 22 times bigger. And that's not to belittle the horrors of
*  Yemen, which I feel very emotional about. But the point is that, I mean, that's it's just, you know,
*  the utter horror. But I suppose the question I would ask is, in terms of as one of the protest
*  leaders, what's the strategy now? Because at the moment, we have a conservative government going,
*  we'll just give carte blanche to the Israeli government to behave as they wish. You've got
*  a Labour opposition where the late leader supported war crimes and then lied through his teeth.
*  And now he's just letting, you know, he's just ignoring MPs who stand against him. So what do
*  you see as the strategy going forward? Well, in the immediate, we've got to use every
*  channel and avenue to build public pressure on our leaders to call for a ceasefire. And look,
*  people often ask the question, what will the protests achieve? It's a valid question. You know,
*  people always go back to the question of the Iraq war devils. I was on them. I'm sure you were.
*  It was. But I'm pretty sure.
*  Yeah, and it didn't stop the war, did it? So but part of my argument is even immobilised
*  or politicised an entire generation. And it set a benchmark as well against which what then
*  unfolded, it wasn't a question of being able to say, well, we told you so. But what unfolded,
*  I think had an impact on some degree of political decision making in sort of other arenas. So look,
*  the first thing we have to do, and this is what our Palestinian partners are asking us, that you
*  need to you need to build pressure through through all appropriate actions, to put pressure on your
*  leaders. Part of that, I think, because I think what's giving the government cover at the moment
*  is the position of the Labour Party. That's given them cover. And I think that is starting,
*  I think the pressure on the Labour Party needs to be maintained. I think it's really important
*  that councillors continue. You know, if more and more councillors are standing down, I would call
*  on members of the shadow cabinet. I know there's a number, you know, who are looking at this and
*  saying this is indefensible. I think Labour MPs need to be told in no uncertain terms
*  that this is going to have a consequence for you at the ballot box. So I think that pressure has
*  to be maintained. But we know, we know the dynamics here. We know all sorts of factors
*  out of our control, which is to what extent will ultimately decision making this country be
*  determined by being close to the US position, etc. All of those factors. And it may be the case
*  that actually, we are going to have to wait weeks and see many more tens of thousands of Palestinians
*  die. I think if I'm looking at the longer term, you know, part of what we are doing is building a
*  broad and wide campaign that has its focus. The question, you know, whenever we bring a Palestinian
*  speaker over, they're always asked the question, what can we do? And they always give the same
*  answer, which is, you know, take action in your country to end the complicity of your government,
*  your public bodies, your companies and corporations, which takes you straight to the
*  call for boycott, divestment and sanctions. And those are the campaigns we need to bring people
*  into. I think what I'm seeing from this moment, you know, there are hundreds and hundreds of people
*  who are becoming deeply involved in this. We are, we are getting people joining us at the moment,
*  becoming full time members of PSC at the rate of over 50 a day. We've got requests to set up,
*  we've got 70 branches around the country, but we've had requests in the past few weeks to set up 10
*  more across the country. I'm being told about, you know, school children who are mobilizing,
*  I was told about a school where the school advised all of the children to come in wearing white
*  as a symbol of peace, because there was this horrible conflict between warring people that
*  been going on. And we needed to respect the position of both sides, etc. So that type of
*  argument that reframe this not as a situation of oppression, but as some complicated conflict.
*  And actually what happened, you know, two or three of the schoolchildren sent something out
*  to their colleagues say this is entirely wrong. I mean, God, I wish I'd been as politicized as they
*  were at the age of 12. And said this is wrong. This is what's going on. And what did they do?
*  They all turned out wearing the colors of the Palestinian flag. So, you know, some of this
*  stuff you don't put back in the box. You know, we know this is a moment where Palestine is across
*  everybody's radar. And there are people that want to be active. And some of those, some of that will
*  dissipate. But there's also a whole body of people who will remember this moment,
*  remember the starkness of what the Palestinian people are subjected to. And that has to go into
*  the energy of building a broad and wide movement for change. This has to be an absolute seminal
*  moment, because now we're seeing what happens if you don't take action? What happens if you
*  don't address oppression? What happens if you sit by as Israel goes farther and farther to the right
*  and starts having as its elected government representatives, people who are self declared,
*  proud fascists, you end up with a genocide unfolding. So we all have a responsibility
*  to do something about that. So that's, you know, that's the bones of a longer term strategy. It
*  comes back to the fundamentals, which is same argument used with apartheid. You know, what
*  sustained it for years was complicity. And once actually, there was an active movement to say
*  that's got to end, then the bricks start falling. Amen to that. And that central point about how
*  our government arms and supports Israel and other Western governments, and that makes the government
*  directly complicit. And we just got to the point in terms of this has to be something different.
*  I was on with the Tory MP, Lin Fox, who's a former defense minister. And the point I made to him was,
*  you brought us Afghanistan, you brought us Iraq, you brought us Libya, every single time, every
*  single thing you said was proved wrong. The worst fears of the critics were vindicated.
*  He can't agree with you.
*  He can't. He's very insistent about the point, by the way. You can see him running around. But
*  they walk from crime scene to crime scene, covered in yet more blood, demanding more blood. And this
*  time, they can't get away with it. But anyway, that was brilliant, Ben. And obviously, I figure
*  across everyone will turn up in great numbers on Saturday and spread the words, friends, relatives,
*  colleagues, random people off the street, if necessary, and we'll be there.
*  Thank you. I'd actually bring everybody you know, including my cat.
*  Including the cat, maybe. Okay.
*  Please like and subscribe. And thank you so much to Benjamin. I do support the Passage
*  Isolation campaign. I'll include a link so people can join them. And speak to you soon. Cheers.
*  Thanks ever so much.
