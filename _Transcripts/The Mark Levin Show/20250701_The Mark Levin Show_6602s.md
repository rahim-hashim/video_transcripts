Video Description: On Tuesday’s Mark Levin Show, there is this Marxist-Islamist movement infiltrating U.S. institutions, especially the Democratic Party. ‘On Power’ is a unique educational tool on these threats and it explores the ideological threats of Marxism and Islamism to American liberty, rights, sovereignty, and faith. It delves into the historical, philosophical, and political contexts of these issues, contrasting the Judeo-Christian belief system with Marxist-Islamist ideologies.  Later, Zahran Mamdani urges progressives to hold firm to their convictions, advocating for policies like student debt cancellation and Medicare for All, alongside radical goals like BDS and seizing the means of production. Mamdani is a Stalinist who’s agenda threatens property rights and liberty. He is masking authoritarian intentions with ‘appealing’ promises. In addition, Asra Nomani joins the program to explain that socialist Muslims have strategically infiltrated the Democratic Party over two decades, leveraging identity politics and progressive alliances to gain influence. This agenda aligns with socialist policies and critiques of capitalism, reshaping the party's direction. Also, David Trulio, President and CEO of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute calls in to announce Mark’s ‘On Power’ book signing, lecture and dinner on August 17, 2025 at the Reagan Library.  Finally, Steve Scalise to discuss the big, beautiful bill that passed in the Senate. It will prevent a major tax hike, eliminating taxes on tips and overtime for workers like servers, and funding border security with wall construction and advanced tech for Border Patrol. It boosts energy production in ANWR and the Gulf, cuts $1.5 trillion in waste, and promotes economic growth. The House must now pass the bill and send it to Trump’s desk.

# Understanding the Threat of Marxism in Politics
**The Mark Levin Show:** [July 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44)
*  Ladies and gentlemen, this next segment of the podcast is brought to you by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=0.0s)]
*  For over 50 years, the Great Heritage Foundation has been America's outpost in Washington, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4.8s)]
*  fighting against the D.C. federal bureaucracy and working to secure a future that allows Americans [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=9.52s)]
*  to live the good life. For too long, common sense principles have been ignored by many of the very [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=14.64s)]
*  leaders claiming to fight for America, but the Heritage Foundation is proud to hold our leaders [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=19.28s)]
*  accountable and stand up for America's founding principles, paid for by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=23.6s)]
*  He's here. Now, broadcasting from the underground command post, deep in the bowels of a hidden [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=30.48s)]
*  bunker, somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=38.0s)]
*  we once again make contact with our leader, Mark LeVein. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  Hello America, Mark LeVein here, our number 877-381-3811, 877-381-3811. We have a very big [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=120.0s)]
*  announcement at the bottom of the hour, about 6.32 p.m. Eastern Time, in less than a half hour, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=132.72s)]
*  so I hope you'll hang in there and listen, whether you're listening on AM or FM radio, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=139.28s)]
*  whether you're listening on satellite radio, whether you're listening on live streaming, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=144.4s)]
*  or the Mark LeVein app, or the iHeart app, or on YouTube, or wherever you are. If I missed, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  I apologize. Hang in there. At the bottom of the hour, we're going to make a big announcement. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=158.08s)]
*  I was not here last night because I was the keynote speaker, although there were great speakers, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=167.52s)]
*  just tremendous, at the Christianage United for Israel event, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=175.36s)]
*  and Kufi represents almost 11 million active Christians in support of the United States, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  the State of Israel, and the Bible. And it was founded by Pastor John Hegge, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=186.88s)]
*  the Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas, his beautiful wife and daughter and son, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=194.96s)]
*  just a beautiful family. My family and his family become extraordinarily close. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=200.72s)]
*  Such a great honor. And we met so many fantastic people there, perhaps many of you, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=207.68s)]
*  just fantastic, God-loving people. You know, we say God-fearing, I say God-loving people. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=217.52s)]
*  And when you think about the debate, the lead up to what Israel did with Iran, and then what we did [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=225.36s)]
*  to their nuclear sites, you realize that this debate occurs mostly in Washington, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=231.68s)]
*  that the overwhelming majority of the American people [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=241.12s)]
*  wanted the Israelis to defeat the Iranians, and wanted the United States military to take [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=245.92s)]
*  out their nuclear sites. And that's what the polling shows. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=249.84s)]
*  And I sat here and I thought about this. Look what's happened in the Middle East. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=253.52s)]
*  Thanks to Benjamin Netanyahu having to deal with Biden, and now Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=260.16s)]
*  teaming up with our great President Donald Trump, what the two of them have done. It's [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=265.04s)]
*  radically changed the Middle East for the better, and more changes to come. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=271.36s)]
*  Change the Middle East for the better, and more changes to come. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=276.24s)]
*  Keep this in mind next time there's a debate among so-called influencers and isolationists, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=282.08000000000004s)]
*  and we red-blooded American yanks. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=287.68s)]
*  All this hate America stuff coming from the isolationists, the paleo-cons, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=292.96000000000004s)]
*  that's what they used to be called, the Buchananites. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=296.88s)]
*  And the Marxist Islamists on the left. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=298.96s)]
*  And look what this President has achieved. There's reason to be optimistic, very. The border is [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=306.79999999999995s)]
*  secure. They're trying to find and remove the criminals, and these are horrendous people sent [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  into this country who've come into this country during the Democrat-Biden regime open border, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=323.36s)]
*  and they came by the millions, ladies and gentlemen. People came here by the millions. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=330.48s)]
*  It's shocking. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=338.40000000000003s)]
*  And this President trying to deal with it. Look at the Supreme Court rule when it comes to these [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=343.52000000000004s)]
*  lower courts. You ruled what we wanted them to rule. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a patsy, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=348.48s)]
*  I'm not a Pollyanna, but I'm just saying let's look at the victories. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=353.28000000000003s)]
*  It just told the lower courts you can't do what you're doing. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=358.0s)]
*  Now will they look for ways around it? Yes, they certainly will. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=361.76s)]
*  But at least in the first round, which is a big round, we won. Look at the other ruling [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=368.8s)]
*  that was written by Alito, 6-3, about parents and children [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=376.0s)]
*  and school boards and school systems. A massive victory. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=384.8s)]
*  And if the President is able and the Republican leadership is able to get this bill through, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=391.44s)]
*  whether it takes a little longer or not, you can have a massive tax cut, not everybody, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=396.72s)]
*  but 70% of the American people. A massive tax cut. And for those of you who don't get much of [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=401.12s)]
*  a tax cut, at least you'll be able to hold on to most of the tax cut you had in the prior Trump term. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=408.0s)]
*  Now you might talk spending. I don't disagree. But what's the alternative here? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=414.88s)]
*  The Democrat Party wants massive tax increases and even more spending. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=420.08s)]
*  And I would say to my conservative brothers and sisters, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=426.24s)]
*  I want bigger tax, excuse me, spending cuts too. But you can't do it when you have a three-vote [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=429.44s)]
*  majority in both houses of Congress because you have the Susan Collins types or you have the [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=435.2s)]
*  Rhino types, you have liberal Republicans or whatever you have. So it's impossible to accomplish [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=442.0s)]
*  what we want to accomplish. There are more reports about how Israelis are killing Palestinians. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=447.6s)]
*  Amazing to me. You've got hostages there and in Gaza, they still want to allow. They could [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=457.92s)]
*  have peace in two minutes, surrender, give the hostages back and it's all over, but they won't [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=463.44s)]
*  do it. They won't do it. That's the bottom line. Now, things aren't perfect. And we need to fight. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=467.84000000000003s)]
*  We need to be resolute. There's a lot to do. There's a movement in this country, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=476.48s)]
*  Marxist Islamist movement that has taken hold that is in our culture. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=481.84000000000003s)]
*  It's in academia. It's destroying our colleges, even our best colleges. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=485.44s)]
*  It's destroying our entertainment. It's destroying our news media. It's destroyed [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=491.36s)]
*  the Democrat party. It's leeching into the Republican party through isolationists. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=495.52s)]
*  And it's a real deal. And all you have to do is look at France and especially England now, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=501.76s)]
*  and then you'll see this has been in the works for about 40 to 50 years. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=507.68s)]
*  CARE was founded in 1993. It's a Hamas front group. It was founded for the purpose of leading the cause [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=512.96s)]
*  to try mainstream radical jihadi Islamism. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=521.12s)]
*  And the Marxists long ago took over our faculty in the 1960s. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=530.24s)]
*  And you have the fusion of what I've talked about repeatedly of the Marxists [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=537.76s)]
*  and the Islamists. They are here. They are dangerous. They've basically conquered the [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=541.12s)]
*  Democrat party. That's what they've done. They've basically conquered the Democrat party. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=546.08s)]
*  How did this happen? It's in my book on power. Where are we going with this? It's in my book on [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=551.92s)]
*  power. Why do they hate us? Why do they want to destroy us? It's in my book on power. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=557.28s)]
*  What about the Democrat party? It's in my book on power. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=565.76s)]
*  I delve into faith. Faith belief. The Judeo-Christian belief system versus the Marxist-Islamist belief system. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=572.08s)]
*  And they have a lot in common, those two. Not ultimately, but a lot in terms of the means, not so much the ends. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=581.92s)]
*  And you're going to read about it. It's something I think that you'll find compelling [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=590.24s)]
*  and really motivating to deal with. And that's the point of this book. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=594.96s)]
*  You're going to look at a way and find a way to look at freedom [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=602.72s)]
*  and unalienable rights like you've never looked at it before. Ever. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=607.2s)]
*  Because in my 11th book, it's what it is. 10, excluding rescuing Sprite on these substantive issues, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=614.5600000000001s)]
*  having taken time to do research for a half a century, to study these issues for half a century. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=624.96s)]
*  I think I've come upon something that's very important. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=634.24s)]
*  People talk about power and passing, and then they move on. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=639.6s)]
*  We talk about liberty till we're blown in the face. We talk about tyranny till we're [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=643.36s)]
*  blown in the face. And we should. But we have to explain why liberty, why tyranny, why not Islamism, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=646.8000000000001s)]
*  why not Marxism, why yes, Republicanism, why yes, constitutionalism. And I lay it out. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=653.92s)]
*  And every time I look, I have this Marxist Islamist anti-Semite [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=660.7199999999999s)]
*  in Tefada supporter, that's terrorism. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=669.36s)]
*  Who's the Democrat nomination for mayor of New York? You never thought of what happened. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=673.76s)]
*  Worse is going to happen. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=677.84s)]
*  If we don't educate ourselves about this, the education in this book is not available [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=681.28s)]
*  anywhere else. You're not going to get it in college. You're not going to get it in high school. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=685.2s)]
*  You're not going to get it in the media. It's not available anywhere else. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=689.04s)]
*  Well, you'll get it in the media to the extent I talk about it. Then you'll get it. Very important. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=693.28s)]
*  And why is it the isolationists are so wrong? I don't even mention them in the book, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=702.72s)]
*  but why is it that they're so wrong? Because they don't accept the mindset of the enemy. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=706.72s)]
*  They don't even treat it as an enemy. They think we're the enemy, or the Jews are the enemy, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=713.2s)]
*  or Israel's the enemy, or the warmongers the enemy. This is a problem. This is a problem [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=717.76s)]
*  we've got to deal with. It's a matter of understanding and informing ourselves on what [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=722.72s)]
*  we're dealing with. I divide this book into different chapters. They're not a lot of chapters. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=728.16s)]
*  They're not a lot of chapters. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=745.36s)]
*  But each one is very important. The first chapter is on power. What do I mean by this? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=749.92s)]
*  Think about power. It's ubiquitous. So what do I mean by it? How am I going to fashion a discussion about it? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=754.0s)]
*  Chapter two is on negative power. What does that mean? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=761.76s)]
*  People think they know what it means, but people really don't know what that means. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=766.8000000000001s)]
*  So I broke out that piece and I explained that. Next chapter, obviously, positive power. What does that mean? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=770.32s)]
*  Why is it positive? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=778.64s)]
*  Chapter four is on language. I address on language in other books, but this time I address it in another way. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=779.76s)]
*  In relation to power and wokeism [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=790.8s)]
*  and speech rules on college campuses and on and on and on. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=796.0s)]
*  On rights. What does power have to do with rights? We have rights right there in the [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=802.96s)]
*  Declaration of Independence. Unalienable rights. Well, there's a difference between God given [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=808.16s)]
*  unalienable rights and how those unalienable rights given to us by God are manifested right here on [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=813.52s)]
*  earth. The earthly application of those unalienable rights. So we're going to discuss that in the book, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=820.9599999999999s)]
*  chapter five and much more. What do we mean by liberty? Well, ladies and gentlemen, I went to [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=826.88s)]
*  the greatest sources of that word. I went to Aristotle and Cicero. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=833.28s)]
*  I went to John Stuart Mill wrote a whole book called on liberty. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=838.64s)]
*  I wrote to the founders. I went to the founders of your country and many more. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=842.8s)]
*  You know what I found, Mr. Producer? There's no great definition for liberty. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=850.0s)]
*  It's typically described by what it's not. When the context is something else. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=857.68s)]
*  And so we get into this. What really does liberty mean? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=863.4399999999999s)]
*  Now, this book could have been a thousand pages long. It could be 10 books. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=873.12s)]
*  If I decided to apply power to immigration, power to equality, power to you name it. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=877.04s)]
*  But that's not the nature of this book. And if I wrote a book a thousand pages long, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=883.76s)]
*  you wouldn't read it. Neither would I be a good good doorstop, probably. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=887.28s)]
*  Or one of those cocktail table books and nobody reads it just sits there. I want you to read it. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=891.04s)]
*  That's why when you read this book, you'll find there's a [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=898.56s)]
*  a limit on the number of endnotes because most of it's my own thinking. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=902.9599999999999s)]
*  There's endnotes. I give credit where credit's due. You will find [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=905.8399999999999s)]
*  that the book, the substance of the book [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=911.1999999999999s)]
*  is 182 pages long, not 300 pages long. You will find in each page, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=915.68s)]
*  in each chapter, something that is intriguing and compelling. You may have to go back and read it [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=920.32s)]
*  twice, maybe three times. Think through the points that I'm raising with you. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=928.0s)]
*  And you're going to find that this book has everything to do with what you discussed at the [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=938.48s)]
*  breakfast table, at the dinner table, at Thanksgiving. This book has everything to do [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=942.96s)]
*  with the debates that go on in this country. This book has everything to do with 80% of what you see [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=946.88s)]
*  on TV or listen to on radio. And it's going to change the way you view things for the better. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=953.52s)]
*  For the better. We have a hell of a show for you this evening, ladies and gentlemen. I'm glad to [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=962.4s)]

*  this is where you pull it all together. And you have a fantastic dinner. Again, we will all meet. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1496.32s)]
*  And we're going to get into the the the guts of this book on power, which I think is crucially [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1501.68s)]
*  important now more than ever. I take questions from the audience. And you know, David, we have [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1506.72s)]
*  people we don't know people we don't even expect show up who sometimes actors and actresses, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1512.08s)]
*  sometimes former governors, people that sort. It's a lot of fun. You don't really know who's [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1517.1200000000001s)]
*  going to come. And it's exciting. It is. It's one of those events. It's fun. And I suspect when you [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1522.0s)]
*  walk away from you're going to talk about as a matter of fact, David, we've had many people, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1531.68s)]
*  parents and grandparents, they bring their children and their grandchildren. They make it a real event. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1536.16s)]
*  They enjoy it. Oh, and Mark, they can make it a full day at the Reagan Library, because [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1541.6000000000001s)]
*  in addition to seeing you and participating in the book signing, there's that tremendous [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1548.0800000000002s)]
*  museum that tells the story of Ronald Reagan and his life his presidency. We also have a remarkable [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1552.4s)]
*  special exhibition right now. The Dead Sea Scrolls. Yes, literally the Dead Sea Scrolls from Israel [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1558.32s)]
*  are with us. So people they'd have to buy a separate ticket for that because that sells out [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1564.88s)]
*  too on the weekends. But they can come to the cafe, they can tour the museum, they can buy a [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1569.68s)]
*  ticket to go see the Dead Sea Scrolls. Eight scrolls, 2000 year old scrolls that reflect the [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1574.72s)]
*  foundations of Judaism and Christianity and their 200 accompanying artifacts. And on top of that, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1581.04s)]
*  they get to see you and get their books signed by you. But I promise everybody, this sells out [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1586.08s)]
*  fast every time. So if you actually want to do this, go to reaganfoundation.org slash Levin right [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1592.24s)]
*  now. The Dead Sea Scrolls. I mean, I went already all the way to Israel to see some of this. So you [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1600.0s)]
*  have it brought back here, folks, I didn't even know this is going to blow your socks off. What [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1605.12s)]
*  you see there, you're going to see the history, the history of how Judaism and Christianity began. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1610.56s)]
*  These Dead Sea Scrolls, they were found in caves in the sides of mountains by people who were just [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1617.9199999999998s)]
*  sort of milling around and miners and shepherds and so forth and so on. And they have a very [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1624.0s)]
*  sophisticated lab set up in the Holy Land to try and decipher them. And they're starting to do that. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1629.6799999999998s)]
*  And the only reason they survive is because they were in these caves and they didn't get wet and so [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1637.04s)]
*  forth. They're 2000 years old. Yeah, it's amazing. And they're the most it's the most important [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1641.04s)]
*  archaeological discovery of the 20th century, certainly one of them. And they're incredibly [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1647.52s)]
*  fragile. They're preserved by the arid climate there. And it's more than a display of artifacts [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1652.72s)]
*  to journey through human spirituality and resilience in the during quest for meaning. So I can't think [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1658.08s)]
*  of a more special way to take it all in at the place that bears Ronald Reagan's name with somebody [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1663.68s)]
*  who served his administration and carries forth the Reagan legacy and principles, Mark Levin. So [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1669.76s)]
*  we're just so grateful, Mark, that of all the places that you can come that you've chosen, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1675.76s)]
*  this at one of only three locations in the United States where you will talk about your timely and [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1680.72s)]
*  consequential book. So reminder, folks, Sunday, August 17, 1 30pm Pacific time. That's when we'll [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1687.2s)]
*  start the book signing at the Reagan Library, Simi Valley, California. It's absolutely beautiful. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1695.2s)]
*  You can honor the lives of the reggans they are. They're buried right there on the property. As a [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1700.56s)]
*  matter of fact, overlooking the beautiful hills of the area and so forth, Simi Valley. And it's [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1704.4s)]
*  always very well organized. You're going to have a fantastic time. A lot of people have been there [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1709.44s)]
*  know exactly what I'm talking about. But again, a lot of people have been there signing up right [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1714.16s)]
*  now as I speak. So if this is something you want to do, do it now. David, I want to thank you so [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1718.64s)]
*  much one more time. Where do people go if they want to sign up right now tonight? Right now they go to [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1724.96s)]
*  reaganfoundation.org slash Levin. And I'm actually sitting next to my computer here and I can tell [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1730.64s)]
*  the orders are starting to roll in. Very good. We'll get them rolling in by the end of the show. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1738.96s)]
*  We're going to roll it baby. All right. Thank you, David. You take care of yourself. God bless. Take [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1744.48s)]
*  care. This is this is an event. It's more than just a book signing. I mean, it's very important. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1751.68s)]
*  It's an event. It's people who come who are happy. We're going to be happier this time than we were [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1759.84s)]
*  two years ago because Biden was president. Now Trump is president. President Trump has Ronald [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1766.96s)]
*  Reagan's official White House portrait as he sits behind the resolute desk over his left shoulder. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1772.88s)]
*  Over his left shoulder. President Trump's tax cuts in many respects the people advising him advised [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1783.2s)]
*  Reagan. So I know they're great tax cuts because of Trump and Reagan's combination of thinking. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1790.32s)]
*  Same when it comes to building up the United States military and so forth. Don't get me wrong. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1795.44s)]
*  Trump is his old man, his own man, but he has tremendous respect for Ronald Reagan. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1799.84s)]
*  I worked for Ronald Reagan for eight years. I never worked for Donald Trump, but he's a dear [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1806.16s)]
*  good friend of mine. And so we'll bring all these these histories, all this thinking, all this [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1811.12s)]
*  background together when we discuss the book. You'll be able to ask your questions when I get [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1817.52s)]
*  to meet each and every one of you. You'll get to have dinner there. And I did not know that the [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1822.32s)]
*  Dead Sea Scrolls would be there. That is fantastic. So you'll be able to check those out too. And [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1827.76s)]
*  this is incredible. I've seen some of this when we were in Israel. What was it? A month or two, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1833.4399999999998s)]
*  whatever it was. I'm losing focus on my time. And once once more, west of the Mississippi, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1841.9199999999998s)]
*  this is it. This is where I'm going. Not because that's the plan. It's just the way it is. I can't [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1848.08s)]
*  travel all over the country, do TV and radio. Some people can. I don't feel I'm treating my audience [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1854.8799999999999s)]
*  properly. And you'll notice it's on a Sunday. It's not during a weekday. We try first Saturday or [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1859.52s)]
*  Sunday. And that's what we're doing in this instance. So if you want to join us, I'm just [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1864.8799999999999s)]

*  judges across our country have consistently been blocking President Trump's attempts to [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1906.56s)]
*  fulfill his mandate. The Heritage Foundation has been analyzing the situation and they've [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1911.28s)]

*  I want you to think of Marxist or communist. Okay, he's not a socialist. Socialist is an economic [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1987.76s)]
*  system. So he's an economic socialist. But he's a Marxist, the iron fist of tyranny. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1992.96s)]
*  This is from 2021. Cut one go. What I wanted to make sure to say is that when we when our position [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=1999.04s)]
*  starts to change, when we start to accumulate power, when we start to elect individuals such [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2012.3999999999999s)]
*  as myself and my other slave mates into local office, we are starting to be treated in a different [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2017.76s)]
*  way than we used to be. And the way in which power engages us now, it is very critical for all of us [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2023.44s)]
*  to remember what it is that we are fighting for. And to remember that our agenda is an agenda that [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2029.28s)]
*  must not be dictated by calculus, but by conviction. And what I mean by that is that the many things [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2035.1200000000001s)]
*  that we believe some of them are already popular in this moment right now, right? If we're talking [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2041.04s)]
*  about the cancellation of student debt, if we're talking about Medicare for all, you know, these [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2046.0800000000002s)]
*  are issues which have the groundswell of popular support across this country. But then there are [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2051.12s)]
*  also other issues that we firmly believe in, whether it's BDS, right? Or whether it is the [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2056.0s)]
*  end goal of seizing the means of production where we do not. Please stop there. Seizing [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2061.52s)]
*  the means of production, seizing, stealing private property, stealing homes, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2069.6s)]
*  stealing businesses, seizing the means of production. Now, ladies and gentlemen, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2073.92s)]
*  your Declaration of Independence and your Constitution talked about protecting what [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2088.32s)]
*  you've earned, protecting what is yours. Again, this book on power gets into this in a big way. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2092.32s)]
*  He just said seize the means of production. He's a Stalinist. He didn't simply say, which we've [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2099.04s)]
*  made enough, share the wealth, did he? Redistribute wealth. He said seize the means of production. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2110.88s)]
*  Now, are we supposed to forget this? Because he smiles. He's also from a fairly wealthy family. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2117.6000000000004s)]
*  I want you to believe he grew up in the Third World. No, he was born in the Third World, [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2123.52s)]
*  and they came to the United States. Then, of course, he wants to destroy the United States. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2126.72s)]
*  He's of Indian heritage. He's also a racist pig because he talks about taxing white people more. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2132.72s)]
*  He's also an anti-Semitic pig because of the things he says about Judaism and Israel. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2142.48s)]
*  This is who he is. Go ahead, Mr. Producer. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2152.96s)]
*  At this very moment, and what I want to say is that it is critical that in the way that we organize, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2159.92s)]
*  the way that we set up our work and our priorities, that we do not leave any one issue for the other, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2166.32s)]
*  that we do not meet a moment and only look at what people are ready for, but that we are doing both [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2174.08s)]
*  of these things in tandem. In other words, impose your will on the people. Dress it up, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2180.64s)]
*  camouflage it, make it sound cool. Freebies for everybody. Who could be against that? [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2184.72s)]
*  Don't accept the status quo. Destroy it and proceed. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2191.92s)]
*  One of the things that's never discussed in this, and I discuss it in the book, is [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2199.2799999999997s)]
*  what do you surrender in exchange for this? [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2203.7599999999998s)]
*  His opponents are probably not smart enough to raise it. Maybe Curtis is, but I can't think of [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2208.88s)]
*  anyone else. What do you lose when somebody says seize the means of production, when somebody says [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2213.3599999999997s)]
*  basically we're going to take over the grocery industry, when somebody says [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2222.88s)]
*  free Medicare for everybody. In his case, it won't be Medicare, but it could be aspects of health care. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2227.2799999999997s)]
*  What do you lose? You lose your liberty. That's what you lose. You lose freedom. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2233.12s)]
*  Because he can't do this through a democratic process. Oh, he'll get elected maybe, but that's [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2239.3599999999997s)]
*  not my point. Once they're in, they're not going to seek your input. They're going to impose their [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2246.24s)]
*  will. There is no way to seek your input and have it matter if you're talking about seizing the means [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2252.88s)]
*  of production. So if you have a business in New York, any kind of business, small, medium, large, [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2258.0s)]
*  food, jewelry, doesn't matter. Seize the means of production. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2263.6s)]
*  Of course, it's obvious. What government can run anything? Seriously. That's a practical point, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2270.16s)]
*  but here's a real point. Any government that can seize the means of production [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2277.6s)]
*  can steal your liberty, can steal your mobility, will make decisions about your life in the name of the people, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2282.32s)]
*  even though the people aren't consulted. This guy is a hardcore Stalinist. He's a Stalinist. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2294.2400000000002s)]
*  Oh, does that mean he's going to lock everybody up? No, but that doesn't mean he's not a Stalinist. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2303.04s)]
*  He has a Stalinist mentality. That's what he is. I'll be right back. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2309.52s)]

*  learned the Dead Sea Scrolls will be there for you to view as well, but I'm already looking at these [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2383.04s)]
*  sales and they're moving very, very fast. So if you want to join us, go to [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2388.72s)]

*  if you wait, you're going to miss out. So anybody who feels like you're missing out, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2399.6s)]
*  so anybody who feels they're going to be there, August 17th is the date. Sorry, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2404.64s)]

*  This will be the only book signing and event actually west of Reston, Virginia. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2416.7999999999997s)]
*  More on that later. But so this is a very big event. We do it and we have a very wonderful time. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2426.4s)]
*  You can ask anybody who's been there. So if you want to jump in, you better jump in now. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2433.36s)]
*  I'll mention it again at the bottom of the hour, but I'm already looking at the numbers. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2438.96s)]
*  So if you want to participate, it's August 17th. Book signing begins at 1.30 p.m. I recommend you [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2442.1600000000003s)]
*  come earlier and join the Dead Sea Scrolls exhibit, which is going to be fantastic. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2448.48s)]
*  And then we'll do our book signing. I don't leave until every book is sold and I shake [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2453.6s)]
*  everybody's hand, as you know. And then we have a chat afterwards and then we'll have our dinner. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2457.36s)]
*  Very special place. The Reagan Library to me is the nicest of the bunch. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2463.2s)]
*  August 17th, 1.30 p.m. Pacific Time. Go to reaganfoundation.org slash L-E-V-I-N. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2468.8799999999997s)]
*  If you forget that, it's up on the social media sites. We have a very special guest with us. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2476.16s)]
*  And I read the piece that she wrote and it was on Fox Digital. And Asra Nomani. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2482.4799999999996s)]
*  Asra Nomani, any friend of Zudy Jasser is a friend of mine. You wrote a remarkable [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2491.7599999999998s)]
*  piece about this Marxist-Islamist alliance and how this has been in the works for a few decades now [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2497.92s)]
*  and how their goal is to destroy America. Welcome to the program. Tell us what it is [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2505.36s)]
*  that you're conveying to the American people here. Yes, so long overdue for us to talk. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2510.32s)]
*  We are friends without having spoken to each other. But yes, you have been a pioneer in this [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2515.28s)]
*  area of research. And what I want to just share with readers is 25 years ago, I was a Muslim, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2523.92s)]
*  like many who was watching the extremism around me, but it didn't hit home until 9-11. And then [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2532.48s)]
*  it became very personal because I was a reporter at the Wall Street Journal and my dear colleague [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2540.0s)]
*  was the journalist Daniel Pearl, who was kidnapped and murdered. Yeah, Mark, he left my house in [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2545.12s)]
*  Karachi, Pakistan. And we hunted, you know, for the men who had kidnapped Danny for five weeks. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2552.64s)]
*  And we learned with the world, the brutal beheading that had happened of Danny. And you know, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2558.72s)]
*  his last words, my father is Jewish, my mother is Jewish, I am Jewish. Those men that murdered Danny [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2564.56s)]
*  had the hate that is now being expressed on the streets of our country and on our campuses [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2571.6s)]
*  against Jews, against Israel, against America. And so for these last two decades, I've been studying [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2580.0s)]
*  these adversaries we face. And what I've documented is that indeed, we have a nexus of the [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2587.36s)]
*  far left socialists with the Islamists who believe in political Islam. And I think what [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2595.7599999999998s)]
*  probably caught your attention this time with this article is that the rise of mayoral candidate [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2602.64s)]
*  Zoran Mamdani captures this true nexus that we have between the red, the green, and the blue, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2610.16s)]
*  that is the Democratic Party. And this machine is working to dismantle America from the inside. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2618.64s)]
*  And it is amazing. Is it not how the media just reported like it's almost no big deal. They [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2628.0s)]
*  pretend that he's not the anti-Semite, the Jew hater, the American hater. He's talked about [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2637.52s)]
*  seizing the means of production. He really is this Marxist, radical Islamist mindset. Right? [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2642.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's very true. And what I really wanted to capture in this article and in my book is why [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2651.44s)]
*  are these blinders on the eyes of so many Americans, even with the evidence right in front [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2659.52s)]
*  of our faces. I mean, Mark, you have said that you have dared to say the S word for so many years, [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2666.96s)]
*  socialism. You have called them out as Marxists. They are self declared. But yet when we have these [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2672.72s)]
*  protests on the streets run by groups like the Party for Socialism and Liberation, you know, [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2679.28s)]
*  they're as blatant as you could possibly be. The media simply reports them as angry Americans, [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2685.2s)]
*  anti-Trump demonstrators, and they are refusing to have transparency on what is playing out in [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2693.2799999999997s)]
*  our streets. Why? What I document in this article and what I document in the book is that 20 years [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2701.6s)]
*  ago, Muslim establishment had a strategy in which they were going to racialize Muslims, turn us into [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2709.44s)]
*  a race and play the victim card. And so in this new pedagogy of critical race theory, [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2718.88s)]
*  we became the oppressed, even though an extremist faction of our community was beheading innocent [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2726.88s)]
*  people around the world. And we ended up becoming the recipients of these donors that were funding [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2734.1600000000003s)]
*  the Democratic Party. And the evidence that I show in the column is a 2008 email from a top official [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2743.28s)]
*  at the Open Society Foundation, which is run by philanthropist George Soros. And it was an email [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2753.52s)]
*  that went to John Podesta, former Clinton, senior advisor and later Hillary Clinton, campaign manager. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2761.44s)]
*  And in that email, they laid the game plan to upend the Bush administration's national security [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2771.6s)]
*  policy, perform this moral inversion, and become victims in the national security space so that [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2778.16s)]
*  today, what's the result? Zoran Moundani declares that we must globalize the Intifada, and he can [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2787.2799999999997s)]
*  then literally weep in front of the camera claiming to be a victim of Islamophobia. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2795.04s)]
*  It is amazing. So what your point is, and your point of your article in your great book, [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2800.16s)]
*  which is called Woke Army, the Red Green Alliance that is destroying America's freedom, [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2806.08s)]
*  you can get it at amazon.com. I encourage you to do that. And your point is this, your point is [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2811.2799999999997s)]
*  they do exactly what they say they're going to do. Then they try to immunize themselves by claiming [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2817.36s)]
*  racism, Islamophobia. And so I saw this over a MediEight, which is a hard little nothing [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2822.16s)]
*  of a website and a guy by the name of Kobe Hall, he's there arguing that this guy's a [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2828.24s)]
*  democrat progressive and how he's being challenged in question and where's the anti-Semitism. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2832.7999999999997s)]
*  And you know, I listed all the anti-Semitism. It's so public. It's out here. I want you to [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2839.2799999999997s)]
*  listen to this. I want you to stick with me a little bit here. Yes, absolutely. I want you [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2843.7599999999998s)]
*  to listen to this. Cut to Mr. Redusa. This is the Zoran Moundani. Go ahead. We have to continue to [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2847.9199999999996s)]
*  elect more socialists and we have to ensure that we are unapologetic about our socialism. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2855.28s)]
*  Now unapologetic about our socials. When I mean that, when I say that, I don't mean that [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2862.4s)]
*  you're voting on, you know, you're voting on an issue about, or you're saying hello to somebody. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2866.8s)]
*  And the first thing you say is, you know, my name is Zoran and I'm a socialist. You can be smart about [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2871.6000000000004s)]
*  the conversations that you have and ensure that you're not. In other words, what he's saying there [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2877.6800000000003s)]
*  is deceive them, deceive them, tell them all the goodies they're going to get, attack the system, [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2881.84s)]
*  attack capitalism, attack Americanism, deceive them and then tell them what they're going to get. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2887.44s)]
*  But do it, do it in a way that's actually going to persuade them and so on. So it's pretty sinister, [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2893.28s)]
*  isn't it? It's very sinister. And you know, some of your listeners might know the word dakiya, [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2898.32s)]
*  which is in our Muslim community. And it basically means gaslighting people, right? Like that's the [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2904.08s)]
*  normal way to talk about it. And the Muslim establishment groups do it all the time because [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2910.72s)]
*  they're saying, invite us to your interfaith dinner. We're going to bring diversity and their [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2917.12s)]
*  diversity doesn't include a system in which you are in equal to them. But in fact, they are [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2923.68s)]
*  practicing their brand of Muslim supremacy. And these socialists are no different. They believe [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2929.68s)]
*  they are so much better than the rest of America that believes in free enterprise and individual [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2935.68s)]
*  liberties. And the really important concept that I want to make sure I talk about is one that I know [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2941.2799999999997s)]
*  is really important to to mark is this three words malign foreign influence. Because, you know, [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2947.68s)]
*  Zuli and I are perfect examples of immigrants who, you know, who came immigrant families that came to [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2955.12s)]
*  the United States and believe in the values of this country. We fight for this country every [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2961.2s)]
*  single day. But there are those from the left and from the Muslim community and from all over that [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2967.2s)]
*  are malign in their intentions about this nation. And they are supported and sponsored by actors [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2973.3599999999997s)]
*  overseas from Qatar to the communist China and interest groups. And we have to be really clear [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2981.3599999999997s)]

*  And so part of my goal is always to just like you do, bring transparency to it so that our Americans [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=2995.7599999999998s)]

*  Welker over the weekend will meet the press on this phrase globalize the Intifada. Now you and I know [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=3008.4799999999996s)]
*  what Intifada is. It's a it's war. It's terrorism against the Jews and now the broader West [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=3014.88s)]
*  and globalize it means that wherever quote unquote Muslims are go to war with the West, [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=3020.2400000000002s)]
*  go to war with people with whom you disagree, especially the Jews. So let's listen to this. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=3027.12s)]
*  Cut for ago. I want to ask you about an issue that has divided some New Yorkers in recent weeks. You [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=3032.0s)]
*  were recently asked about the term globalize the Intifada if it makes you uncomfortable. In that [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=3037.44s)]
*  moment, you did not condemn the phrase. Now, just so folks understand, it's a phrase that many people [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=3044.24s)]
*  hear as a call to violence against Jews. There's been a lot of attention on this issue. So I want [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=3049.52s)]
*  to give you an opportunity to respond here and now, do you condemn that phrase globalize the Intifada? [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=3055.6s)]
*  That's not language that I use. The language that I use and the language that I will continue to use [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=3062.64s)]
*  to lead this city is that which speaks clearly to my intent, which is an intent grounded in a belief [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=3067.04s)]
*  in universal human rights. And ultimately, that's what is the foundation. Stop there a minute. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=3072.8s)]
*  Stop there for a second. So this is exactly how he does it, how he's been indoctrinated to do it, [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=3079.1200000000003s)]

*  felt literally with my finger, the bullet holes, you know, that have pierced through walls in the [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=3095.6800000000003s)]

*  except in their propaganda where, you know, I've been on the streets now here, Mark, from Chicago to [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=3116.8799999999997s)]

*  organizations that Zoran Mandani also led at his college are very clear that they want the extinction [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=3132.08s)]
*  of the state of Israel from the river to the sea. They want a right of return, as they call it, of [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=3139.68s)]
*  every single Palestinian that has ever had any roots in that identity. And they call it a [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=3146.32s)]
*  civil democracy because they want a demographic overhaul of the nation, right? So that Israel is [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=3154.8s)]
*  no longer a homeland for the Jews. And I will add this one last element, which is, unfortunately, [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=3161.52s)]
*  among the extremists, there is that belief too in end times, you know, and in their end times [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=3168.6400000000003s)]

*  in all of this. And Zubi and I know this because we've studied it. We see it in our mosques. We know [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=3182.0s)]

*  actually condemn it? I think that's the question and the outstanding issue that a number of people, [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=3332.1600000000003s)]
*  both of the Jewish faith and beyond have. Do you condemn that phase globalize the interfaith, [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=3337.84s)]

*  why he won't. Am I right, Azra? Yeah. And he's agreeing with it from two angles, because he [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=3372.24s)]
*  believes in the interfaith, which is the rebellion of the Palestinians against the Jewish state. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=3379.52s)]
*  And then he also believes in it as a socialist for the destruction of American free enterprise. As [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=3385.4399999999996s)]

*  what they call the United States. And people don't have to believe me. For the last year, [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=3398.24s)]

*  Azra? So, Mark, I built a database. There's 2,500 groups in it. Half of them are these socialist, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=3415.3599999999997s)]
*  Marxist, communist, Leninist groups, self-described. They want to turn to Philippines [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=3423.76s)]

*  The evidence is so there. And now we have this convergence of the Islamists with the socialists. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=3434.48s)]

*  You are a self-described democratic socialist. Do you think that billionaires have a right to exist? [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=3989.76s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=3997.1200000000003s)]
*  Let's start. He thinks it's funny. Now, he's playing to the Marxist stuff, class warfare. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=3998.1600000000003s)]
*  What if billionaires don't exist? That means Microsoft wouldn't exist. Apple wouldn't exist. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4006.5600000000004s)]
*  We can go through all the things that have been created that have created enormous wealth for [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4012.2400000000002s)]
*  certain individuals and groups of individuals. And why does it matter to us if Bill Gates is [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4016.72s)]
*  a billionaire? What does it matter to us if the Jobs family? Look what they've created for us. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4022.08s)]
*  Why does it matter if Bezos is a billionaire? He created Amazon, which is very helpful to us. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4026.9599999999996s)]
*  And I can go on and on. Why is that? It's better that governments have trillions and trillions of [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4032.3999999999996s)]
*  dollars to tell us what to do, how to live, what we can eat, what we can wear, and on and on and on. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4037.2799999999997s)]
*  And if you're a billionaire, [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4041.92s)]
*  in most cases, most, you haven't inherited your money unless your name is Alex Soros. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4047.44s)]
*  But in many cases, you've created wealth. You've created things for people. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4052.08s)]
*  And that's why you're a billionaire. And there's a lot of billionaires who don't remain billionaires. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4058.7200000000003s)]
*  Just because you're raised in wealth doesn't mean you keep your wealth. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4062.88s)]
*  Go ahead. You are a self-described democratic socialist. Do you think that billionaires have a [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4066.48s)]
*  right to exist? I don't think that we should have billionaires because frankly, it is so much money [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4072.64s)]
*  in a moment of such inequality. Let's stop. There it is. It's inequality. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4079.68s)]
*  So if we don't have billionaires, there'll be equality. No, there won't. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4085.84s)]
*  How many of you work your ass off every day? [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4090.64s)]

*  So you just have a democrat party that voted against cutting Medicaid for illegal aliens and [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4106.96s)]
*  cutting Medicaid for mentally and physically capable young men who won't work 20 hours a week. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4112.5599999999995s)]

*  Again, pretend there's no billionaires whatsoever. Is that equality? Is that okay with you? [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4137.360000000001s)]
*  Of course it's not. But here's what's not discussed. And again, it's in my book, On Power. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4142.8s)]
*  Here's what's not discussed. What liberties and rights do you have to surrender to live under a [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4149.04s)]
*  regime like this? That says no billionaires. That says seize the productive assets of society. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4155.92s)]
*  That says we're going to tax the whiter neighborhoods more. That says our grocery [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4162.96s)]
*  stores will be run by the city. What kind of liberty and rights do you surrender? [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4167.76s)]
*  What kind of government do you live in? You live in a communist, Islamist government [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4173.6s)]
*  where you will suffer, where you won't have abundance, where you won't have the food that [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4181.6s)]

*  deeper and go further. There should not be billionaires, but there should be illegal [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4208.08s)]
*  immigrants on Medicaid, right? That's okay. He's decided there shouldn't be billionaires. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4215.679999999999s)]

*  Do they make them sort of marijuana? I've never smoked what's up. They make a marijuana. What do [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4248.4s)]

*  They invest in capital. They invest in research. Maybe they build apartment buildings. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4260.0s)]
*  Maybe they reinvested many things because they want to keep making money. They want that money [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4269.04s)]
*  to work. And so they have that money and it's working and it's working and it's working. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4273.2s)]
*  So they hire people. They hire electricians when they build. They hire plumbers. They hire [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4276.88s)]
*  bricklayers. They hire roofers. They hire construction workers. They hire, hire, hire, hire. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4281.44s)]
*  That's what you do with money. You don't put it in your mattress. Now what's the government do with [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4286.48s)]
*  money? Oh, you're white? We're giving the money over here. Oh, you're a Jew? We're giving the [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4294.0s)]

*  they don't have a role in making the money. They just have a role in distributing the money. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4314.96s)]
*  You need an IQ of seven and maybe that's high to be a communist. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4325.12s)]

*  Reganfoundation.org slash Levin. Our signing event, our dinner event, our huge event at the [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4432.96s)]
*  Regan Library, which we do is Sunday, August 17th, 1 30 p.m. Pacific Time. If you want to join, [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4441.52s)]
*  you need to join now. Word to the wise. In a few minutes, we lose New York. We will pick up LA in [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4448.72s)]
*  about an hour. But still, if this is something you want to do, you really need to jump in now. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4456.96s)]
*  And I encourage you to do it. I'd love to see you again. That's thereganfoundation.org slash [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4462.4s)]
*  Levin at the Regan Library in Simi Valley, August 17th on a Sunday, 1 30 p.m. Pacific Time. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4466.799999999999s)]
*  And there you have it. Word to the wise. I'm doing three signings. I'm also not signing any [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4476.0s)]
*  books in advance. Sometimes I've done that too. What I did do, though, is I read the [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4482.4s)]
*  with Mr. Vedusa, we did record the entire audiobook from beginning to end, which is a first [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4488.32s)]
*  for me. And the reason is because the book is more concise than the other books. It's just packed. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4494.48s)]
*  It's loaded, but it's more concise. And you can get it at amazon.com, of course. But I'm trying to [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4500.719999999999s)]
*  encourage people who want to go to these. And I'm going to announce the other ones in short order, [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4507.759999999999s)]
*  too. But the Regan Library has to prepare for the crowd, which is why we do that earlier. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4514.0s)]
*  And which is why we pretty much press it today. We'll mention it a few other times because there [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4520.32s)]
*  is a overflow section and people can come and just have the book signed. You get in line, [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4526.400000000001s)]
*  just have the book signed because again, it's the only place I'm going to be west of Reston, Virginia. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4533.6s)]
*  So I just want to encourage you to and all else to say, if you don't act soon, you're not going to [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4538.96s)]
*  get in there. And I really want to see as many of you as possible. All right. Don't forget. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4545.36s)]
*  Don't forget. Regan foundation dot org slash live in jumping. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4552.0s)]
*  And he's here. He's here. Now broadcasting from the underground command post deep in the bowels of [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4557.28s)]
*  a hidden bunker somewhere under the brick and steel of a non-descript building. We've once again [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4570.48s)]
*  made contact with our leader, Mark Levin. Hello America. Mark Levin here. Our number 877-381-3811. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4576.48s)]
*  877-381-3811. Well, the big beautiful bill with some changes, I suppose, passed in the Senate [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4589.28s)]
*  barely. And he gave some stuff to Markowski. She's really, [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4597.04s)]
*  she's truly grotesque. And of course, Susan Collins votes again. She's up for election. So [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4605.04s)]
*  the only thing that matters is voting for her, I guess. This guy Tillis has gone. He defended [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4611.6s)]
*  the indefensible that is Medicaid without cutting illegal aliens and people who can work [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4617.76s)]
*  from the rolls. And of course, Rand Paul. And Rand Paul has become a crackpot. He may think he's the [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4622.64s)]
*  great one. He wants to cut this. He's a crackpot. That's what he is. He's a crackpot. And it's a big [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4631.92s)]
*  problem. And we're going to have Steve Scalise on at about 820, about 15 minutes. I don't want to [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4641.280000000001s)]
*  get into all the arguments over this bill. I want to know what's in it. What's in it that we should [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4649.2s)]
*  like and not like. And I want you to remember something. They have a three vote majority in the [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4654.16s)]
*  House. You have over 200 members who are a three vote majority, right? I mean, anybody can blackmail [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4659.84s)]
*  anybody under those circumstances. That's kind of what Murkowski did in the Senate. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4675.44s)]
*  But I also blame the leadership over that. They should have rolled that parliamentarian who is [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4682.08s)]
*  taking things out of the bill that the House put in. Again, the Medicaid issue. She's a bureaucrat. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4686.08s)]
*  That's what she is. She's not in the Constitution. She has no constitutional role whatsoever. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4693.599999999999s)]
*  She's a parliamentarian. Big deal. Doesn't really mean a damn thing. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4699.759999999999s)]
*  And yet, she's got all this power. Are you okay with that? [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4708.4s)]
*  I'm not okay with that at all. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4714.88s)]
*  I want to read something that's very interesting. We got a sense of this on our social sites. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4718.88s)]
*  Iran's digital army exposed bots 240,000 posts tried to stop Trump's strike. This is from [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4723.92s)]
*  Hayyam. Iran mounted a comprehensive campaign to undermine American public support for military [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4731.36s)]
*  action against its nuclear facilities by deploying a sophisticated bot network that disseminated [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4738.16s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of deceptive messages, according to groundbreaking research commissioned [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4743.92s)]
*  by the Ministry of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism. This is how you also see some of [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4749.36s)]
*  these podcasters' numbers spike. And of course CNN reports it and mediocre I reports it. A lot of [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4754.32s)]
*  this is phony. Phony. I think the horrendous anti-Semitic garbage that's on my sites, Mr. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4760.64s)]
*  Biduser, is partly coming out of Iran as well as other countries. Don't you? I mean, there are [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4767.52s)]
*  some out there, we know that, but not like that. We've been reading some pretty crappy stuff. I [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4775.76s)]
*  mean, a lot of it. The investigation which analyzed social media activity on X during [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4779.36s)]
*  Operation Rising Line intensified at least 100 fabricated accounts systematically promoting [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4786.0s)]
*  Tehran's strategic messaging. Beyond merely spreading disinformation to glorify Iranian [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4791.84s)]
*  successes while fabricating Israeli failures, the Iranian government has been trying to [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4797.84s)]
*  protect its own interests. Tehran invested substantial resources in targeting domestic [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4802.32s)]
*  audiences within Israel and the United States. Research has examined approximately 100 [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4809.36s)]
*  accounts, actually that's more than a thousand accounts, exhibiting clear signs of automated [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4818.639999999999s)]
*  rather than human operation. These accounts maintain continuous activity across all hours [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4824.4s)]
*  without typical human patterns of rest. Moreover, they generated content at superhuman speeds, [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4829.76s)]
*  posting thousands of messages daily. The content frequently appeared identical or remarkably [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4835.68s)]
*  similar across multiple suspicious accounts, strongly indicating coordination by bot activity. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4840.96s)]
*  And I think that's exactly what happened on my sites, as well as many others. The examine [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4847.92s)]
*  Network ultimately distributed 241,712 posts, reaching millions and millions of users worldwide. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4854.16s)]
*  Iranian messaging operations divided into four distinct categories promoting regime loyalty and [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4862.4s)]
*  supreme leader Ali Khamenei, the bot network advanced Iranian nationalism seeking to frame [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4868.16s)]
*  the conflict as targeting Iran's people rather than its government. A second message category [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4873.6s)]
*  targeted both Iranian domestic audiences, Israeli citizens with fabricated reports of Israeli [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4878.72s)]
*  military failures. These automated accounts circulated and manipulated imagery and AI [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4884.64s)]
*  generated content depicting false scenarios such as Tel Aviv engulfed in flames or Israeli aircraft [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4890.8s)]
*  destroyed over Iranian territory. Additional messages streams sought to characterize Israel [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4896.16s)]
*  as a terrorist state that murders children and massacres Palestinians. I guess this mom mommy is [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4901.4400000000005s)]
*  uh into this. However, the research identifies Iran's most significant ready for this most [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4907.28s)]
*  significant operation as systematic efforts to turn American public opinion against President [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4913.2s)]
*  Donald Trump's military action targeting Iranian nuclear infrastructure. You heard this from [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4919.2s)]
*  Katarlson. You heard it from pardon me Bannon. You heard it from no pants gates. You heard it from [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4924.5599999999995s)]
*  the dumbest member of the House of Representatives. Trader what the hell is her name? I don't even [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4930.639999999999s)]
*  remember. It doesn't matter. All these people basically were spewing the Iran line. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4935.44s)]
*  These accounts amplified messaging identical to Republican. Here you go. Critics of the military [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4943.28s)]
*  strikes following Trump advised Steve Bannon's claims that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4947.759999999999s)]
*  exercised control over the president. Iranian accounts circulated imagery depicting Trump as [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4952.639999999999s)]
*  Netanyahu's marionette. We had that on our sites Mr. Producer. Or a dog owned by the Israeli leader. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4958.0s)]
*  We had that on our sites too depicting Trump as Netanyahu's dog. Research findings show Trump was [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4963.68s)]
*  consistently portrayed across the bot network as Netanyahu's puppet according to the Ministry of [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4971.360000000001s)]
*  Diaspora. The network also promoted anti-semitic messaging targeting the American Israel Public [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4976.56s)]
*  Affairs Committee and Jewish Americans like me as allegedly controlling US decision-making [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4983.04s)]
*  echoing themes from American isolationist movements. Got that? The research notes however [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4988.96s)]
*  that Iranian bots did not directly coordinate with actual American opposition voices. No, [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4994.56s)]
*  they just regurgitated it. I don't believe this was at mediocre right this piece because it would [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=4998.96s)]
*  expose them as mouthpieces for Iran. It would expose the Drudge Report. It would expose these [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5003.44s)]
*  these isolationists. They were mouthpieces and I said over and over and over again. You gotta [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5010.24s)]
*  believe that the propaganda these morons are putting out is going to be used by the Iranian regime [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5014.4s)]
*  and by God it was. The director of the research division of the ministry, a long-time analyst, [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5019.839999999999s)]
*  he explained to Hayyam that historical evidence demonstrates the measurable impact of sustained [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5029.28s)]
*  messaging operations particularly those originating from Iran. He said over many years Qatar and other [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5034.719999999999s)]
*  opponents of Israel systematically funded and distributed anti-semitic and anti-Israel content. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5040.4s)]
*  Western nations often accommodated these efforts under principles of enlightenment, [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5045.839999999999s)]
*  liberal tolerance, and intellectual openness. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5049.599999999999s)]
*  We now observe how these messages denying Israel's fundamental right to exist. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5054.879999999999s)]
*  So the bots were active, people were right, and it wasn't just Iranian. It was North Korean, it was [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5061.5199999999995s)]
*  Russian, and others. But Iran took the the propaganda put out by our isolationists, [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5066.32s)]
*  repeated it, and promoted it so millions and millions of people could see, and tried to affect [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5077.2s)]
*  our politics desperately seeking to prevent Donald Trump or to persuade Donald Trump not to [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5083.36s)]
*  do what he did which was of course spectacular and crucially important. Spectacular and crucially [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5088.32s)]
*  important. I'll be right back. Steve Scalise, the majority leader in the house, made it right [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5096.0s)]
*  under the button there baby. Steve Scalise, how are you my friend? Hey Mark, how are you? I'm doing [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5116.88s)]
*  great. Great to hear from you again. It is. You're a good man. It's always good to hear from you. So [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5123.28s)]
*  just without getting into all the back and forth, tell us what is in the bill [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5128.0s)]
*  that we should like, but tell us what the Senate changed in the bill that you guys now have to [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5133.5199999999995s)]
*  wrestle with if you don't mind. Yeah and I'll start with that first part of your question because [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5138.8s)]
*  frankly Mark, I think that's the part that gets lost too much is people talk about what they want [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5144.639999999999s)]
*  in or what they don't want in, but let's talk about what's actually in the bill that is great [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5150.24s)]
*  for this country and it's all the Trump agenda. Donald Trump ran saying number one, I will not [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5155.679999999999s)]
*  let anybody's taxes go up and I think a lot of people might not realize but if Congress does [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5161.12s)]
*  nothing, takes no action, everybody who pays taxes in America will see their tax rates go up [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5166.08s)]
*  dramatically. It'll be about a 60% tax increase. We obviously don't want that to happen. Kamala [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5172.32s)]
*  Harris wanted that to happen and it was a big part of the debate. President Trump was clear, [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5178.56s)]
*  we're going to prevent the tax hike from happening and so that's in this bill. He went further and he [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5183.4400000000005s)]
*  said, if you work for tips, if you work overtime, you're not going to have to pay taxes on that [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5188.160000000001s)]
*  money. That's in this bill. So if you're, you know, the Democrats, every Democrat in the House and [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5194.240000000001s)]
*  Senate has voted against this bill because they want a tax increase. They want more money for [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5199.68s)]
*  Washington but also they're hiding behind this lie of its tax cuts for the millionaires and the [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5205.12s)]
*  billionaires. Think about this, Mark. The average work pay for a worker who works for tips is [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5210.16s)]
*  $32,000 a year. There's no millionaires or billionaires benefiting from the new tax provisions [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5216.96s)]
*  and that's no tax on tips and no tax on overtime and so if every Democrat's going to vote against [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5224.24s)]
*  working people in America, you know, you're working three shifts at the diner or your local restaurant, [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5229.12s)]
*  you're working overtime at a factory and you're being away from your family but you look at the [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5234.24s)]
*  paycheck and you go, is it really worth being away when all this money is going to the government? [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5239.04s)]
*  You're not going to have to pay taxes on that anymore and it's only because Republicans in [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5243.28s)]
*  Congress worked with Donald Trump to deliver and every Democrat's voting no. So that's in the bill [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5247.5199999999995s)]
*  and that's going to be a big relief to working families and it's going to help boost the economy. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5252.639999999999s)]
*  We also deliver on border security. So Donald Trump again ran on a border security campaign. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5257.76s)]
*  He's delivered on a lot of that, Mark, as you know and you've reported it. However, he's running out [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5264.56s)]
*  of money to deport criminals. He needs more money. He needs more money to finish building the wall. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5269.2s)]
*  That's in this bill. He needs more money so that our border patrol agents, it's embarrassing right [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5274.64s)]
*  now, the drug cartels of Mexico have better technology than America's border patrol agents. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5279.68s)]
*  It's a real problem. They've been talking about it for years. Biden didn't want to fix it because [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5285.28s)]
*  he didn't want them controlling the border. Trump wants to fix it but that costs money to give them [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5290.08s)]
*  drones and night vision goggles and other things. That's in this bill. We do some things to strengthen [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5295.04s)]
*  America's defenses. So all of those things are in this bill. Some other provisions that were focused [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5300.32s)]
*  on growing the economy, lowering inflation, lowering interest rates so you can go buy a first time home [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5306.48s)]
*  and then getting America's economy back on track, producing more energy in America. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5312.72s)]
*  We all ran on that. We deliver in this one big beautiful bill. Everything from opening up more [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5317.52s)]
*  energy, exploration and production in ANWR in Alaska all the way down to the Gulf of America [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5322.320000000001s)]
*  and every point in between will be producing more energy. That's bad news for Putin. It's bad news [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5328.160000000001s)]
*  for Iran and Venezuela because America will be energy dominant again. That's in this bill. So all [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5334.0s)]
*  of those things are in the bill and it doesn't happen if we don't pass this bill which is why [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5340.24s)]
*  it's so critical. So obviously you've got fault lines. Gee whiz, we want to cut more. I wish we [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5344.48s)]
*  could cut more but guess what Mark? This bill cuts over 1.5 trillion dollars in waste, fraud and abuse, [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5350.16s)]
*  work requirements, making people get back to work again instead of sitting on the government. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5358.16s)]
*  Hold on. Let's hit this Medicaid. You're trying to save Medicaid for God's sakes. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5362.32s)]
*  People off of Medicaid who won't work 20 hours a week yet have the physical and mental capacity [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5369.6s)]
*  to do it and they're sitting at home collecting freebies and you want to take illegal aliens off. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5375.76s)]
*  The Democrats voted against removing illegal aliens from Medicaid so you're trying to save [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5380.64s)]
*  the program. Are you not? Yeah the program's going bust and if you're a disabled person or a pregnant [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5386.0s)]
*  woman, the people that the Democrats hide behind, the program's going bust for those folks. It's not [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5392.240000000001s)]
*  working for those folks because they're getting crowded out by the illegals and by the 35 year [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5397.44s)]
*  old able-bodied guy who's sitting at his mom's basement turning down work while playing video [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5402.32s)]
*  games all day long. Well guess what? He's going to have to get off his butt and go to work and [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5407.12s)]
*  that's going to make the program work better for the people that truly do need it. That's in this [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5411.679999999999s)]
*  bill. Let me, Mr. Producer, cut 10. Let me play this Chuck Schumer line for you because these guys, [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5416.5599999999995s)]
*  they're basically sloganeers, you know. You've got to explain what's going on because they hit [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5423.04s)]
*  you with slogans. Cut 10, go. Today, Senate Republicans betrayed the American people [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5427.2s)]
*  and covered the Senate in utter shame. They betrayed the American people and covered the [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5434.8s)]
*  Senate in utter shame. In one fell swoop, Republicans passed the biggest tax break for billionaires ever [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5441.92s)]
*  seen, paid for by ripping away health care for millions of people and taking food out of the mouths [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5449.36s)]
*  of hungry kids. This is not a big beautiful bill at all. That's why I moved on the floor [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5457.839999999999s)]
*  to strike the title. It is now called the Act. That's all it's called. By the way, that's his [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5466.24s)]
*  microphone. That's not our audio problem. He can't even get a microphone to work. You know, Steve [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5472.719999999999s)]
*  Scalise, how do you stand these psychopath liars that just get up there taking the food? Can I ask [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5477.04s)]
*  you a question? Isn't the budget still going to be trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars? [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5485.84s)]
*  Trillions. And Mark, it's going to grow. It's just not going to grow above inflation in some of those [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5490.64s)]
*  areas. And Chuck Schumer knows he's lying. By the way, this is the same guy I remember who said, [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5496.48s)]
*  if you like your health care plan, you can keep it. If you like your doctor, you can keep it. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5501.36s)]
*  And he voted for Obamacare. And then millions of people lost their doctor and lost their health [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5505.28s)]
*  care plan. So this guy's got no credibility. And here he is lying yet again, it's what he does for [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5510.4s)]
*  a living. And it's sad because there are some people that maybe want to believe him. But let's [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5515.679999999999s)]
*  look at the facts. Okay. Look at what he said. Look at what he said on just on the Medicaid side. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5519.5199999999995s)]
*  The only people ever losing Medicaid are fully able bodied. Again, the able bodied people who [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5526.88s)]
*  are crowding out the disabled people and it's work requirements, Mark. And if they still go [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5531.6s)]
*  look for work, they can still get the benefits. So they have to look for work. They can't turn [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5537.6s)]
*  down work. So that's in the bill. No kid is going to lose SNAP benefits, you know, pulling food from [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5543.52s)]
*  the mouths of babes. Is he in Rwanda? What country is he talking about? In America, every kid that [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5548.88s)]
*  is eligible for SNAP and food stamps still gets it. You know who doesn't? The able bodied adult [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5556.16s)]
*  who's turning down work and is able to go get a job. If you lose your job and you're down on your [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5562.24s)]
*  time and you can't get a job, those programs are there for you. But they're getting crowded out by [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5568.4s)]
*  all of these people who are turning down work just to sit at home. We know this all started [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5572.96s)]
*  and got worse during COVID. We're ending this party. You know, you can still sit at home. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5577.92s)]
*  Just don't ask the taxpayer of America to front $40,000, $50,000 in government giveaways for you. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5582.72s)]
*  So these programs will work better. And by the way, tax cuts for the billionaires, [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5588.56s)]
*  who's he talking about, Mark? There is not a tax cut for billionaires in the bill. I thought Chuck [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5593.280000000001s)]
*  Schumer would have read the bill. They made him read the bill on the Senate floor. It took 14 hours. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5598.400000000001s)]
*  They read it. He must have been sleeping when the reading happened because he would have seen [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5602.320000000001s)]
*  that the only tax cuts in this bill go to the $32,000 a year waiter and waitress at your local [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5606.56s)]
*  restaurant who won't have to pay taxes on tips and the shift worker who's working overtime who [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5614.0s)]
*  won't have to pay taxes on the overtime, not the billionaires. Current rates stay the same. So [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5618.88s)]
*  nobody's taxes go up, which Schumer wanted, but there is no tax cut for billionaires in the bill. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5623.76s)]
*  It's a lie. They've been telling, by the way, since 2017, when Donald Trump passed the first [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5630.0s)]
*  tax cuts and jobs act and grew this country like we've never seen before. Is this not a party that [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5634.64s)]
*  supports this guy in New York who is a Marxist Islamist? Is this not a party that supports [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5639.92s)]
*  Tlaib and AOC and Omar who hate this country? Is this not a party that is gutting the nation, [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5644.8s)]
*  that had open borders and had illegal aliens and terrorists and criminals come across the border, [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5652.160000000001s)]
*  didn't blink at all the women sold into sex slavery and all the children sold into sex slavery? [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5657.360000000001s)]
*  You're right on Steve Scalise. God bless you, my friend. I hope you're doing well, by the way. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5662.72s)]
*  I'd love to have you back soon. We'll be right back. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5667.76s)]
*  Mark doesn't suffer fools well. So if you're a fool, don't call 877-381-3811. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5673.76s)]
*  Oh, we have some calls. All right. Let us go to Kathleen Long Island, New York. How are you, Kathleen? [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5684.8s)]
*  Hey, Mark. How are you? I'm doing great. Good. You were amazing at the keynote. I watched the whole [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5697.12s)]
*  thing. You were off the charts. I know you don't like people to call in and compliment you, but [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5703.92s)]
*  you know what? Too bad. Were you there or you saw it online? No, I saw it online. I wish I was there, [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5708.48s)]
*  but I am a Christian United for Israel. I'm actually a Catholic United for Israel. I've been [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5714.4s)]
*  a pro-Israel, what, 25 years, whatever it is. And my closest friend is Orthodox because I live right [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5718.639999999999s)]
*  on the border of an Orthodox area and her husband's a rabbi. And they told me to tell you [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5726.0s)]
*  that you're not only a mensch, you're the mensch. Wow. Yes, they love you. And some people, [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5730.959999999999s)]
*  hate me even more now. Right. So I wanted to tell you, and I also learned from you and from growing [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5738.0s)]
*  up over the years that we conservatives, we practice what we preach, but socialists and [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5745.68s)]
*  liberals don't. For example, if I'm walking by and I see a shot that doesn't allow guns, I don't go [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5750.64s)]
*  in because I carry one. And if you hate Jews, you need to not use any products that were invented by [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5757.360000000001s)]
*  Jews because there are quite a lot of them, not only in medicine, which I practice, but in life. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5766.72s)]
*  Like the camera that you use for FaceTime that was invented by a Jew, the first camera phone [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5772.8s)]
*  invented by a Jew, they have like a glaucoma, cataract removal. And if you don't have corneas [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5778.96s)]
*  and they can't find a donor for a cornea transplant, there's a machine invented by a Jew [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5789.92s)]
*  that you can get a man-made device. Thank you. So if you hate Jews, don't come to the hospital [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5795.04s)]
*  because you're going to have a very hard time. Antibiotics started with Jews. The list is endless, [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5805.28s)]
*  which I know you know. Well, how can you give me the long list that the Palestinians have [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5810.16s)]
*  invented? Oh yes, nothing but menace and evil and disgusting things. I mean, it's same with America. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5816.0s)]
*  Western society builds things, they develop things. It's a very humane way of thinking. Western [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5826.96s)]
*  society, the Judeo-Christian thought processes, or even reformed Muslims and so forth, that have [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5832.08s)]
*  gone on people that embrace the Enlightenment and the Reformation. If you're a seventh century [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5838.64s)]
*  throwback, you're into killing and destroying. That's it. That's it. That's all they know and [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5844.0s)]
*  they don't do anything. Like socialists like this guy running for mayor in New York, I can't even [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5849.92s)]
*  pronounce his name and I don't even want to. I really don't think he's going to win. I think [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5854.48s)]
*  Curtis is going to do it and I'll tell you why. I have my Israel flags, I have my American flags [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5858.4s)]
*  all over my car and I'm telling you, and I go into Brooklyn, Bronx to go visit patients at home, [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5863.52s)]
*  everybody likes Israel. Jews, Christians, Hispanics, Black people, everyone. Trust me, [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5868.4s)]
*  everybody doesn't, but that's okay. What's that? Trust me, everybody, we even have these isolationists [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5874.5599999999995s)]
*  who claim to be a MAGA, they're fake MAGA. They trash Netanyahu, they trash Israel, they sound like [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5881.2s)]
*  you know, Bernie Sanders and Islamists. And he's Jewish, which is so disgusting and Chuck Schumer, [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5887.92s)]
*  I don't know anybody that keeps putting that, I'm not going to say what I'm thinking back into [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5894.16s)]
*  office because he's absolutely horrible. He just lies about everything. Like if you ask him, [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5899.92s)]
*  are you Chuck Schumer? He'll say no. Like he's so out of his mind and any New York Jew that votes [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5903.76s)]
*  Democrat is crazy. Yeah. Crazy. Yeah. There'll be a percentage who do. Nobody gets it except them. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5910.72s)]
*  I'll tell you why. When you have people who put their faith in political ideology in a political [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5918.72s)]
*  party before they do their actual faith, and it's not just Jews, unfortunately, they're there, but [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5926.320000000001s)]
*  even Catholics who vote for people who believe on abortion on demand and that sort of thing. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5932.240000000001s)]
*  These are people who are not really people of faith. They're born Catholic, born Jewish, [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5937.12s)]
*  whatever it is, but they really don't believe. They just don't. You're a sweetheart. Thank you [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5941.12s)]
*  for your call. I really appreciate it, Kathleen. God bless you, my friend. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5946.24s)]
*  Let's continue. Steven, Brooklyn, New York. Go right ahead, please. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5951.5199999999995s)]
*  Yes. Hello. I wanted to comment on what the things what this lady talked about, [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5957.2s)]
*  but I wanted to talk about the billionaires. Yes, sir. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5964.08s)]
*  Can't thank to the billionaires a lot of things. Billionaires maintaining and building hospitals, [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5967.12s)]
*  they maintain a judicial system, they're bringing in energy, they're bringing in all the oil, [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5973.68s)]
*  what people are using in their cars. Let me slow you down because you're [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5980.32s)]
*  making a great point. You go to these massive, beautiful, cutting edge hospitals, billionaires [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5983.12s)]
*  put their names on them. Steven's making the point that's because they make these massive [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5991.76s)]
*  donations to them. I happen to know several, I don't know Langone, but there's Langone Center, [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=5997.36s)]
*  you've got the Perlmutter's like Perlmutter, Laurie Perlmutter. They do the same thing [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6002.64s)]
*  all over the place. They put their money. And so I would ask this, this Mamdani guy, [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6009.68s)]
*  what's he ever given? What's he ever given anybody, Steven? [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6015.52s)]
*  Probably nothing. I think if he has good ideas, why doesn't he do them in his own country? [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6020.72s)]
*  Well, I don't know what his own country is, to be perfectly honest with you. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6029.6s)]
*  We don't need a person with new ideas. We don't need a person with social ideas. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6033.52s)]
*  Social ideas have been tried in Russia. They did not work. They're trying to learn now from us. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6040.320000000001s)]
*  You're right. They've been tried in California. They don't work there either, Steven. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6049.04s)]
*  Thank you for your call, my friend. We've got to keep moving. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6053.12s)]
*  Nancy, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on the Mark Levin app. Nancy, how are you? [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6057.200000000001s)]
*  Well, Mark, thank you. Mark, I once won a contest for my answer to the question of what is the best [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6063.52s)]
*  oxymoron. I said democratic socialism. To simplify it for people, democracy is when people [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6071.200000000001s)]
*  are in charge of the government. Socialism is when the government is in charge of the people. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6080.64s)]
*  Whenever anybody like the New York candidate for mayor on the Democrat ticket, AOC, Bernie Sanders, [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6087.12s)]
*  or any of the rest of them use that phrase democratic socialism, they're using a term that [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6095.599999999999s)]
*  sounds so good and nice, but they're using it as an oxymoron for morons. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6101.679999999999s)]
*  They're liars. That's what they are. They're liars. They come up with phrases. They come up [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6110.88s)]
*  with slogans. They came up with terminologies, but the people need to understand what it is that [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6115.6s)]
*  they're giving up in exchange for freebies, their liberty. Some people don't give a damn, [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6120.8s)]
*  and so they'll vote for their own tyranny. The world has seen this over and over and over again. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6125.52s)]
*  Then when it's too late, then when it's too late, it's too late. Thank you for your call, [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6130.160000000001s)]
*  my friend. Excellent. Let's keep going. Let's go to Mark Jackson, New Jersey. How are you, sir? [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6135.6s)]
*  I'm all right. Thank you. We keep talking about this Stalin-Mandani guy and what a disaster he is [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6141.28s)]
*  and what a disaster he could become and bring the city with him. I think we also have to keep [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6149.5199999999995s)]
*  talking about the positive option. You had Curtis Fleewell on the show a couple of days ago, [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6155.44s)]
*  and I thought it was great that you endorsed him and that you support him. But I think from now on, [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6161.759999999999s)]
*  instead of just yelling and ranting about a lot of conservative people are doing it, saying, [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6166.96s)]
*  this is Mandani, I don't know what are we going to do? It should be known. Mandani is terrible. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6172.400000000001s)]
*  Everyone go vote for Curtis. If you heard me yesterday, I also said he and Cuomo and the [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6175.2s)]
*  mayor better get together and figure out who they're going to get behind because otherwise [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6181.6s)]
*  we're going to lose. I think honestly Cuomo is a has-been at this point. I agree. He's walking [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6184.88s)]
*  around like a... Cuomo had his chance. He blew it, didn't he? He blew it in the Democrat primary. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6192.96s)]
*  He's a lackluster candidate with a not just baggage, but baggage after baggage after baggage. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6197.28s)]
*  Remember, he ran away from his own party. He's walking around now like a corpse. He looks like [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6204.64s)]
*  he died, I don't know how many years ago, and he has nothing to bring to the table besides the [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6209.6s)]
*  scandal after scandal. Mayor Adams didn't do a great, you know, he's not so hot either. He was, [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6214.0s)]
*  for him he thinks that Larmondani is his second coming because now everyone says, oh well. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6220.24s)]
*  Okay, but you just said we're not coming up with a solution and your solution is going to be what? [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6224.88s)]
*  We have to vote for Curtis. We have to get behind Curtis. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6231.52s)]
*  That's fine. I said I endorsed him, but these three better get together and get behind somebody [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6234.16s)]
*  or they're going to lose. You can't divide this vote and then this maniac slips it through. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6239.2s)]
*  By the way, history is filled with examples like this, [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6245.2s)]
*  whether they're fascist regimes or Marxist regimes or whatever they are, [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6248.72s)]
*  that we're so busy fighting among each other that a real enemy of the people gets elected. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6253.5199999999995s)]
*  A real enemy of the people. So I think these three guys need to sit down and make a decision. If [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6262.32s)]
*  Cuomo won't, I don't think the mayor is willing to do it. Sliwa really is the best alternative [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6267.04s)]
*  from my point of view, but it's going to take somebody or some group of people to figure this [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6273.12s)]
*  out because I'm telling you right now, it's not because Marx says so. The numbers don't work. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6278.32s)]
*  They do not work. Thank you for your call. They don't work. We'll be right back. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6283.84s)]
*  Hey, Mark. I just wanted to catch up to you because you're the only one that's calling things the way [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6288.32s)]
*  they are. And I'm speaking specifically about this guy in New York. Everybody wants to call [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6314.8s)]
*  him a social democrat or even a Marxist. And then anybody who knows anything knows that Marxists [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6319.92s)]
*  are not religious in any shape or form. This guy, if you do any background on him at all, [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6325.12s)]
*  is a Shia Muslim who leaves me in the infatata and is also a 12er, which means he's got exactly [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6330.64s)]
*  the same theology as Zia Topolkhameni. You're right on, but he's also a Marxist in the sense [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6338.32s)]
*  that he believes in the complete control of the economy and so forth. So I don't mind people [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6345.36s)]
*  calling him a Marxist Islamist, but you make a great point. That's why he's never going to condemn [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6351.5199999999995s)]
*  never global intifada. If you don't condemn it, you're 40. So those aren't words I would use. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6357.28s)]
*  That's obvious because he's a liar. Good point, Larry. Good job. So before I sign off, [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6363.04s)]
*  which will be in a few minutes, just a reminder as people come and go in the program, [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6369.84s)]
*  a lot of people stay the whole time. We very much appreciate it. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6376.16s)]
*  We're having our special event August 17th, Sunday at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6380.4s)]
*  We're having our book signing, our discussion, Q&A, dinner, a fantastic, fantastic day and evening. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6385.6s)]
*  They also have a very special event going on there that I want you to check out as well. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6396.240000000001s)]
*  And the Dead Sea Scrolls, and you're going to get to see some of this. That's unbelievable in their [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6403.040000000001s)]
*  museum. And of course, the Reagan Museum itself and the President and the former First Lady are [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6407.4400000000005s)]
*  both buried there in a beautiful spot. And you'll find a bench with my parents' name on it in honor [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6413.6s)]
*  of them as well because we had that put there too. But you're going to love it. Those of you who've [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6420.160000000001s)]
*  been there, now's the time to jump in. Love to see you. Now's the time to celebrate the election [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6425.92s)]
*  of Donald Trump and to talk about what we need to do. What we need to do about these people who would [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6432.0s)]
*  take our country away. And we are surrounded by these people. They're in our culture. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6438.64s)]
*  And I want to have that discussion with you when we're there. In any event, it's the [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6443.92s)]
*  reaganfoundation.org, slash, Levin, reaganfoundation.org, slash, L-E-V-I-N. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6447.6s)]
*  I don't know how many they've sold. For all I know, they're done. But I want to encourage [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6455.04s)]
*  you to contact them as quickly as possible. Just go online, grab your tickets. If you just want to [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6459.52s)]
*  sign book, you can do that too. We'd love to have you. I'm doing three book signings. This is the [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6466.16s)]
*  furthest one west. I'm not going any further west than Reston, Virginia, which means there's a lot [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6472.4s)]
*  of space between Reston, Virginia and California. We love to see our friends in California all the [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6479.84s)]
*  time. In the LA area, in the Simi Valley area, Ventura, California, and so forth and so on. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6485.12s)]
*  Great patriots still there, ladies and gentlemen. Millions of them. Great patriots. And we love, [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6490.96s)]
*  they're happy, happy patriots because we have this fantastic time. It's very exciting. It's a big [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6496.320000000001s)]
*  event. I really enjoy going out there and doing it with the family and everybody. We look forward [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6501.92s)]
*  to seeing everybody. Parents and grandparents bring their kids and grandkids. It's a lot of fun. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6509.52s)]
*  It's an event. It's a national town hall meeting where patriots get to meet. You're going to have [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6515.120000000001s)]
*  a blast. We do every year. This is our ninth time. Is that what she said, ninth time, or he said, [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6521.84s)]
*  Mr. Producer? Ninth time? That's a lot. And I love to keep going there. So once again, [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6528.16s)]
*  reaganfoundation.org, slash, Levin, reaganfoundation.org, slash, L-E-V-I-N, jump in now. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6534.16s)]
*  You can't call in later and say, Mark, I want it, but it doesn't work that way. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6541.6s)]
*  It goes to the first person. And we have families that come in here, four or five people. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6545.6s)]
*  And just think about that. That happens 100 times, then it's over. 200 times, it's over. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6552.08s)]
*  They only have like a thousand seats there. And I guarantee you by now, three quarters of them are [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6558.16s)]
*  gone. I'm guessing. I don't know. But that's pretty much the way it works. We salute our armed [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzzyTLtB44&t=6564.24s)]
