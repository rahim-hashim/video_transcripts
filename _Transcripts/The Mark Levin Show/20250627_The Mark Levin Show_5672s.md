Video Description: On Friday’s Mark Levin Show, the Second Industrial Revolution unleashed American capitalism’s potential, driving unprecedented economic growth and creating a prosperous middle class. Contrary to Marxist critiques, capitalism delivered widespread benefits through innovation, producing abundant food, housing, medical care, and modern conveniences like clean water and automobiles. These advancements raised life expectancy and living standards far beyond historical norms, showcasing capitalism’s ability to foster prosperity and self-correction in open societies, unlike Marxist or autocratic systems. This is an answer to NYC Mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani who said he doesn’t support capitalism. When you understand capitalism it’s very easy to defend.  Also, there were two big Supreme Court cases today. In a 6-3 Supreme Court decision written by Justice Barrett, the court ruled against universal injunctions, asserting federal courts lack authority to broadly oversee the executive branch. Barrett’s opinion emphasizes courts must stay within Congress-granted powers, preventing judicial overreach that could undermine the presidency and constitutional framework. Justice Jackson’s dissent is radical. The ruling protects the democratic processes. In addition, there was a 6-3 decision written by Justice Alito, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of parents in Montgomery County, Maryland, who challenged the school board's policy of mandating LGBTQ and related curricula in elementary schools without informing parents or allowing them to opt out. This decision reinforces protections for religious freedom and parental authority. Finally, Gianno Caldwell joins to talk about his new book, The Day My Brother Was Murdered: My Journey Through America’s Violent Crime Crisis.

# Capitalism vs. Marxism: The Battle for America’s Future
**The Mark Levin Show:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE)
*  Ladies and gentlemen, this next segment of the podcast is brought to you by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=0.0s)]
*  For over 50 years, the Great Heritage Foundation has been America's outpost in Washington, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4.8s)]
*  fighting against the D.C. federal bureaucracy and working to secure a future that allows Americans [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=9.52s)]
*  to live the good life. For too long, common sense principles have been ignored by many of the very [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=14.64s)]
*  leaders claiming to fight for America, but the Heritage Foundation is proud to hold our leaders [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=19.28s)]
*  accountable and stand up for America's founding principles, paid for by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=23.6s)]
*  He's here. Now, broadcasting from the underground command post, deep in the bowels of a hidden [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=30.48s)]
*  bunker, somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=38.0s)]
*  we once again make contact with our leader, Mark LeVein. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  Hello America, Mark LeVein here, our number 877-381-3811, 877-381-3811. We have these [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=120.88s)]
*  great cases to talk about. We have a lot to talk about, by the way. Tremendous demand, Mr. Producer. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=133.28s)]
*  The Katarlson expose that I did a couple of weeks ago on radio, we reposted that on my social [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=140.08s)]
*  sites. It's worth your enjoyment over the weekend, so you can see what you're dealing with there. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=147.44s)]
*  You know, Fox's ratings are through the roof. My ratings are through the roof. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=154.88s)]
*  And so you might say, well, maybe I keep fighting with these people. No, that's not what I do, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=162.72s)]
*  but I will when I need to. Here's the deal. The President of the United States took care of [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=167.68s)]
*  business. The Israelis took care of business. The Israelis in one of the greatest military [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=174.32s)]
*  operations ever destroyed the Iranian regime's military in two days. President Trump destroyed [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=180.23999999999998s)]
*  their nuclear program in about three seconds. And so the isolationists look very stupid. I mean, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=187.68s)]
*  stupider than they physically look. They look very, very stupid. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=195.2s)]
*  And so they're desperately trying to be relevant again. It'll never happen. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=198.08s)]
*  It'll never happen. Katarlson will always look like a clown. Marjorie Trader Green will always [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=205.52s)]
*  be a clown. Pardon me. Banner will always be a convicted, confessed felon. I don't even know [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=211.68s)]
*  if he can vote, by the way. And the list goes on. You got Gates, a proven pervert. It's good when [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=218.72000000000003s)]
*  he keeps his pants on. We're just doing our Friday sum up on what's going on. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=225.2s)]
*  But you ought to take a listen. It's very interesting. You know, Ben Shapiro has one [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  out there. That's interesting. Maybe we'll post that one too. There's also some kind of a documentary. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=235.83999999999997s)]
*  But Katarlson went from wanting to blow Iran off the face of the earth [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=242.79999999999998s)]
*  to wanting to kiss their ass to kissing the ass of the Qatari monarchy, Putin's ass. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=247.04s)]
*  There's not a fascist, Marxist, Islamist who Katarlson's lips haven't been attached to. Hence, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=254.08s)]
*  hence, he's the happy hooker of politics. He's got more positions than a hooker. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=261.68s)]
*  Forget the happy part. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=269.44s)]
*  Now, ladies and gentlemen, we have this guy running for mayor. Zoran [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  Mamdani. No, no offense. No offense. Zoran sounds like, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=278.32s)]
*  sounds like one of these TV commercials for a prescription drug, doesn't it, Mr. Bidou? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=284.24s)]
*  Have you had your Zoran today? Doesn't it? But nonetheless, he's worse than that. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=287.84s)]
*  Zoran Mamdani is a Marxist Islamist. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=294.64s)]
*  And he said what he really cares about is equality. And he was asked today about capitalism. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=301.52s)]
*  He doesn't support capitalism. That's one of the reasons he runs for office. He wants more equality. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=308.48s)]
*  Guy's 33 years old. He's got the intelligence of Margaret Trader Green. In other words, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=315.2s)]
*  he moron, negative IQ territory. And so I want to read something to you. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=319.68s)]
*  You experience this yourselves every day of your life, you experience this. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=329.36s)]
*  But sometimes you get a step back and look at it. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=334.08s)]
*  So this is from On Power, my book On Power that'll be out in a few weeks. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=338.88s)]
*  Although there have been what is described as the first industrial revolution, stick with me, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=344.32s)]
*  which began around 1790. Much of American capitalism was in its infancy. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=349.36s)]
*  It was not until what is referred to as the second industrial revolution, which began around 1870, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=355.2s)]
*  that American capitalism exploded onto the scene, resulting in unimagined economic development, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=361.03999999999996s)]
*  growth, and prosperity. I'm going to make the case for capitalism. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=366.32s)]
*  For capitalism. The second industrial revolution created extraordinary capital and wealth and [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=374.24s)]
*  a huge and, yes, comfortable middle class. And where and when our society wanes or fails, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=382.8s)]
*  as all imperfect people in societies do, whether in economics or civil rights, etc., [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=389.84s)]
*  Americans have both the capacity and motivation to correct course. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=395.52s)]
*  That is what positive power is about. And America's founding teaches us this. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=399.68s)]
*  It is how a civil society not only survives, but improves, reforms, and hopefully thrives. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=406.71999999999997s)]
*  Of course, the same cannot be said of Marxists or other autocratic societies and regimes. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=413.28s)]
*  Marx died in 1883, late enough to see the early stage of America's bursting industrial might. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=420.0s)]
*  Nonetheless, the vast majority of what he wrote and argued had already been recorded in his books [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=428.32s)]
*  and his essays. In fact, his most widely read paper, which he co-authored with Engels, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=434.08s)]
*  you've heard of it, is the Communist Manifesto. Now, that was penned in 1848, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=441.04s)]
*  well before the early days of this second revolution, industrial revolution. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=447.92s)]
*  My point is, putting aside all other critiques of Marx, that is, his ideology was misplaced from [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=454.08000000000004s)]
*  the start, capitalism, as he coined market economics, was and is a tremendous human and [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=459.92s)]
*  societal success, not only for individuals, but for the bulk of the people. The second industrial [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=466.24s)]
*  revolution created technologies that changed the world forever, benefiting humankind from then until [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=472.8s)]
*  now. Indeed, so ubiquitous is the miracle of capitalism swirling around us every day. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=480.0s)]
*  Its presence is mostly ignored and taken for granted. This is in On Power, my new book. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=485.52000000000004s)]
*  Instead, what we are taught in most schools and hear from the media and academia, as well as [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=492.0s)]
*  Democrat Party officialdom and American Marxists, is a relentless bombardment of propaganda and [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=498.0s)]
*  agitprop about class warfare, social injustice, and terminal inequity, all intended to poison [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=504.32s)]
*  the public mind and destroy the American experiment. The few short paragraphs that follow [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=511.36s)]
*  prove the entire Marx materialism doctrine wrong. Ready? This is an answer to this clown who's running [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=518.0s)]
*  as the Democrat for mayor in New York. Economist George Reisman, in his 1996 book Capitalism, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=526.16s)]
*  and this is a substantial book, makes an overwhelming case for the universal benefits of capitalism, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=534.8s)]
*  that is, its incredible material benefits for the individual and the people, which have absolutely [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=540.88s)]
*  nothing, nothing to do with class struggle. He explains that there is no class struggle at all. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=548.56s)]
*  Industrial civilization has radically increased life expectancy, writes in the 20th century, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=556.56s)]
*  that's the last century. In the United States, it has increased life expectancy from about 46 years [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=562.16s)]
*  in 1900 for the present 75 years. This is capitalism. The enormous combination of industrial [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=568.4s)]
*  civilization to human life is further illustrated by the fact that the average newborn American [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=575.8399999999999s)]
*  child has a greater chance of living to the age of 65 than the average newborn child of a non-industrial [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=581.12s)]
*  society has of living to the age of five. The marvelous results have come about because of an [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=586.64s)]
*  ever-increasing supply of food, clothing, shelter, medical care, and all the conveniences of life, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=594.16s)]
*  the progressive reduction in human fatigue and exhaustion. All of this has taken place on the [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=601.44s)]
*  foundation of actual science, technology, and capitalism, which have made possible the continuous [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=607.36s)]
*  development and introduction of new and improved products and more efficient methods of production. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=613.76s)]
*  This is what capitalism has created, market economics. He says famine has been ended [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=621.28s)]
*  in industrial societies because industrial civilization has produced the greatest abundance [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=626.72s)]
*  and variety of food in the history of the world. It has created a huge amount of food and food [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=631.6s)]
*  in the history of the world. It has created the storage and transportation systems required to bring it to everyone. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=636.0s)]
*  This same industrial civilization has produced the greatest abundance of clothing and shoes and [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=641.68s)]
*  housing in the history of the world. And while some people in the industrialized countries may [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=647.12s)]
*  be hungry and homeless, it is certain that no one in the industrialized countries need to be hungry or homeless. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=651.6s)]
*  Industrial civilization has also produced the iron and steel pipe, the chemical purification and pumping [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=658.24s)]
*  systems, and the boilers that enable everyone to have instant access to safe drinking water, hot or cold, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=665.2s)]
*  every minute of the day. It has produced the sewage systems and the automobiles that have removed filth [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=671.84s)]
*  from human and animal waste from the streets of cities and towns. It has produced vaccines, anesthesia, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=678.64s)]
*  antibiotics, and all the other wonderful drugs of modern times, along with all kinds of new and improved [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=684.64s)]
*  diagnostics and surgical equipment. It is such accomplishments in the foundation of public health [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=691.04s)]
*  and in medicine, along with improved nutrition, clothing, and shelter, that have put an end to [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=698.4s)]
*  plagues and radically reduce the incidence of almost every type of disease. This is what capitalism [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=704.32s)]
*  has created, America. As a result of industrialized civilizations, not only do billions more people [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=710.4s)]
*  survive, but in the advanced countries, they do so on a level far exceeding that of kings and emperors [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=716.4s)]
*  in all previous ages, on a level that just a few generations ago would have been regarded as possible [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=722.64s)]
*  only in the world of science fiction. With a turn of a key, the push of a pedal, and the touch of a [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=729.1999999999999s)]
*  steering wheel, they drive along highways and wondrous machines at 60 miles an hour. With the flick of a switch, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=735.2s)]
*  they light a room in the middle of the darkness. With the touch of a button, they watch events take place [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=742.72s)]
*  10,000 miles away. With the touch of a few other buttons, they talk it to other people across town, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=748.4000000000001s)]
*  across the world. They even fly a car to the city center. They even drive a car to the city center. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=755.5200000000001s)]
*  Across the world, they even fly through the air at 600 miles per hour, 40,000 feet up, watching movies, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=762.4s)]
*  sipping martinis, and air conditioning comfort as they do so. In the United States, most people can have all of this. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=770.4s)]
*  And spacious homes or apartments, carpeted and fully furnished, with indoor plumbing, central heating, air conditioning, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=780.4s)]
*  refrigerators, freezers, gas and electric stoves, also personal libraries of hundreds of books, records. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=787.44s)]
*  They can have all this, as well as long life and a good life with good health, as a result of working just 40 hours a week. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=793.44s)]
*  That is what capitalism has created. And I add, indeed, in the United States, walk through a neighborhood supermarket, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=803.44s)]
*  itself a word unheard of less than a century ago, supermarket, makes available to anyone and everyone more abundance and choices of food, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=813.44s)]
*  beverages, over-the-counter pharmaceutical products, cleaning products, toiletries, among other things, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=821.44s)]
*  from every corner of the country and the planet, packaged to ensure their freshness and safety than at any time in human existence. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=827.44s)]
*  An assembly line worker, plumber, electrician, bus driver, and janitor have more material goods at their fingertips, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=835.44s)]
*  more material goods at their fingertips today, than Caesar, King George III, and Stalin ever did or could have ever imagined. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=841.44s)]
*  This is the real-world evidence and experience with the principles that underlay our Declaration of Independence. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=851.44s)]
*  Not mysticism, not theoretical, or out of date, or unproven, or what have you. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=859.44s)]
*  The human condition and rights that they articulate and establish are real, tangible, contextual. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=865.44s)]
*  They're on display and in play every minute of the day. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=871.44s)]
*  Conversely, the entire Marxist project is an evil fiction. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=876.44s)]
*  It is the greatest deception in the name of the people, the proletariat, and equality ever produced. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=883.44s)]
*  It plays into the jealousies that man has, one for the other, by focusing on unequal economic outcomes. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=889.44s)]
*  Of course, there can never be perfect equality. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=896.44s)]
*  And therefore, any and every imperfection, no matter how insignificant, is an occasion for Marxist exploitation and confirmation. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=900.44s)]
*  And Marx also institutionalizes what I call finger-pointing. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=909.44s)]
*  That is, who is responsible for the individual's dissatisfaction and unhappiness? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=913.44s)]
*  Marx does not recognize the individual in free will, thus the state and its economic system. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=918.44s)]
*  And those who are said to have created it, sustained it, and benefited from it, the bourgeoisie, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=924.44s)]
*  they're responsible for a person's difficulties and their challenges, life challenges. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=930.44s)]
*  Again, this is among the reasons Marx rejects individualism and free will, and relentlessly attacks the existing society, natural law and eternal laws. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=936.44s)]
*  The same representative democracy, that is the state, and the economic system, capitalism. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=947.44s)]
*  And I go on from there, that's just a taste of it, as I like to tell you. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=953.44s)]
*  That's on my new book, On Power, that comes out soon. You can get it at Amazon.com. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=958.44s)]
*  In defense of capitalism, and if people understand capitalism, it's very easy to defend. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=964.44s)]
*  And if you understand this guy, and you understand what he stands for, that's right. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=970.44s)]
*  If you understand who this Marxist Islamist is, Zoran Mondani, 33 years old, has never done a damn thing, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=975.44s)]
*  then you have an argument for defeating him. I'll be right back. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=985.44s)]
*  President Trump is in Washington with a mandate from the American people to solve the border crisis, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=996.44s)]
*  reverse the effects of Bidenflation, and restore American greatness. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1001.44s)]
*  But since January 20, judges across our country have consistently been blocking President Trump's attempts to fulfill his mandate. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1005.44s)]
*  The Heritage Foundation has been analyzing the situation, and they've been able to identify the legal issues with these judges' actions, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1012.44s)]
*  as well as the solutions that can end this potential crisis. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1020.44s)]

*  We're getting into these cases big time, and I have a little bit of a different take, I think, than many. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1067.44s)]
*  A prominent Wall Street economist who had slammed President Trump's tariffs earlier this year now says that the president may have outsmarted all of us, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1073.44s)]
*  quote unquote, on his trade policies. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1080.44s)]
*  I can't pronounce this guy's name. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1085.44s)]
*  I'll give it a shot. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1086.44s)]
*  Torskin Slick, chief economist and investment giant Apollo Global Management, said that while the uncertainty surrounding trade policy has already started to weigh on the economy, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1087.44s)]
*  Trump could lower tariffs on most of the US trading partners while using the levies to boost federal revenue. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1098.44s)]
*  He suggested in a recent post analysis that the administration's approach may be more strategic than previously thought. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1104.44s)]
*  How do you like that? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1112.44s)]
*  This guy was a big critic of Trump. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1113.44s)]
*  I don't know how anybody can attack it. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1115.44s)]
*  The economy is doing pretty well. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1117.44s)]
*  And once he gets his tax cuts in, it's going to take off like a rocket. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1119.44s)]
*  And that's why he's pushing to get this damn thing done. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1124.44s)]
*  And I mean, there's there's effectively no inflation. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1127.44s)]
*  Interest rates are low. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1131.44s)]
*  He'd like them lower and I don't blame him. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1133.44s)]
*  The job creation is chugging along. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1135.44s)]
*  I mean, think about this just based on the policies put in place through executive orders and other, you know, regulations and so forth. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1138.44s)]
*  And here he's waiting for his tax cuts. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1148.44s)]
*  Imagine what's going to happen. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1150.44s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1151.44s)]

*  Now, if you're not concerned yet, you should be. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1161.44s)]
*  When these judges use injunctions to block President Trump's attempts to fulfill his mandate from the American people, it is we the people who lose out. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1163.44s)]
*  Thankfully, the Heritage Foundation has the policy solutions to stop these threats to our judicial system. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1171.44s)]

*  Very important that we call out the Jew haters, the anti-Semites who claim to represent you and me, claim to be part of MAGA. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1227.44s)]
*  That's not who we are. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1236.44s)]
*  We're red-blooded Americans. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1239.44s)]
*  It's not how we think. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1243.44s)]
*  We want nothing to do with these people. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1247.44s)]
*  We don't want their... [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1250.44s)]
*  We don't want their reputations touching us, not even close. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1254.44s)]
*  Not even close. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1260.44s)]
*  And these people seriously are anti-Semites. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1263.44s)]
*  Some of them are flat-out racists and bigots. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1269.44s)]
*  Terrible. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1274.44s)]
*  You can go on the Internet. You can see. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1276.44s)]
*  You can see. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1279.44s)]
*  The media play them up. I don't care if they play them up. They give them headlines. I don't care if they give them headlines. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1281.44s)]

*  Always underestimate it. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1298.44s)]
*  Because most of these people live in the comments sections on the Internet, Mr. Producer. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1301.44s)]
*  They live there with the Russian trolls, the Iranian trolls, the North Korean trolls, the Communist Chinese trolls, the Cuban trolls. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1307.44s)]

*  Well, let me put it this way. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1329.44s)]
*  People like that who try and get on our programs, try to call in, they're cut off. We want nothing to do with them. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1331.44s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1337.44s)]
*  The humiliation and embarrassment of being an isolationist. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1340.44s)]
*  Really, I know it's hard. It's hard. It's hard to shake it. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1348.44s)]
*  The people that told us that defending ourselves and the Israelis defending themselves against a nuclearized Iran will be Armageddon, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1354.44s)]
*  will be World War III, at least a regional conflict, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1364.44s)]
*  they're embarrassed because they look stupid, because they are stupid, but they're ideological. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1368.44s)]
*  So they press ahead and they'll repeat themselves. Doesn't matter. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1372.44s)]
*  They said the Jews will drag us into a war. Did they? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1378.44s)]
*  Not a single American soldier has died in any of the wars against Israel. Not one. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1384.44s)]
*  Fighting for Israel. Not one. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1392.44s)]
*  But they can't help it. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1396.44s)]
*  Look at who we're talking about. And they truly are Jew haters. But they're America haters too. We've talked about this. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1399.44s)]
*  The Judeo-Christian value system is something we share with the people in the Holy Land. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1406.44s)]
*  It's called the Holy Land for a reason. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1414.44s)]
*  They're supported by all kinds of very evil and diabolical people, sometimes financially. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1421.44s)]
*  They're more comfortable with fascists and Islamists than they are with conservatives. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1429.44s)]
*  They're always on the attack. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1440.44s)]
*  Attack against people you like. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1444.44s)]
*  Against members of Congress that you like. Against a president that you like. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1448.44s)]
*  They've been completely discredited just in the course of the last few weeks, utterly and completely. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1455.44s)]
*  Their own words can be used against them. Their own writings can be used against them. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1460.44s)]
*  And yet they are the playthings of the left media. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1465.44s)]
*  Because the left media want to pretend that they represent us. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1468.44s)]
*  They want to pretend that there's this divide in Magna when 94% of you supported the president of the United States. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1473.44s)]
*  And support the state of Israel. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1481.44s)]
*  They are in the position of supporting the enemy. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1484.44s)]
*  The Islamist mass murders in Iran. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1487.44s)]
*  Because that's what isolationists really are for. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1491.44s)]
*  Because we all know the enemy is not going to go away on its own. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1494.44s)]
*  We all know the enemy is not going to be passive. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1497.44s)]
*  The enemy is not going to worry about forever wars. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1500.44s)]
*  The enemy is not going to worry about any of that stuff. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1502.44s)]
*  President Trump understands. Ronald Reagan understood. We all understand. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1507.44s)]
*  We get it. We get it. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1513.44s)]
*  So you have this combination of the left media with these people. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1518.44s)]
*  And they promote them and they give them headlines and all. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1525.44s)]
*  And you people shouldn't worry about that. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1529.44s)]
*  You're shooting emails and they let you see this. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1531.44s)]
*  It doesn't change a damn thing. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1536.44s)]
*  We're not going anywhere. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1540.44s)]
*  As long as you love this country. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1542.44s)]
*  We have a great show Saturday night. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1546.44s)]
*  With Newt Gingrich and Colonel Richard Kemp. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1550.44s)]
*  We talked a little bit about this and Gingrich is really, really smart. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1554.44s)]
*  He's got real context. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1558.44s)]
*  And he said these people are tiny. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1561.44s)]
*  They're a tiny number of people who have big mouths. They're very loud. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1563.44s)]
*  And he's right. And they're very wrong. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1565.44s)]
*  Richard Kemp, retired colonel, was the commander of British forces in Afghanistan. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1569.44s)]
*  I don't think they can call him a chicken hawk. Can they, Mr. Reducer? [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1574.44s)]
*  He's seen combat, a lot of combat over the course of his career. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1580.44s)]
*  He was all in. All in. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1587.44s)]
*  We have the great Ted Cruz. Supposed to hate Ted Cruz now, I guess. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1592.44s)]
*  On our Sunday program and Julian Epstein is a very good guy. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1597.44s)]
*  He's a Democrat, quite moderate. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1600.44s)]
*  He's very upset about what's happening to his party. And we need to give people like this voice. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1602.44s)]
*  We need to give people like this voice. Him, Fetterman, people like that. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1607.44s)]
*  Because they're up against it in the Democrat Party and they they need to rebuild [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1613.44s)]
*  this sort of moderate aspects of the Democrat Party for our sake, too. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1618.44s)]
*  We can't have these Marxist Islamists winning office. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1622.44s)]
*  We can't. But we also have to watch on our side. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1629.44s)]
*  We can't have truly stupid bigots. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1633.44s)]
*  Grifters. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1640.44s)]
*  Fraudsters. I'm not overstating it. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1643.44s)]
*  To be used by the left media. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1647.44s)]
*  As representative of us, it's not going to happen. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1650.44s)]
*  Not while I'm here anyway. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1653.44s)]
*  Let's get into these two opinions. They're big deal. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1655.44s)]
*  First, we have this case involving, as you know, you've heard a lot about this now, these [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1659.44s)]
*  these national or what they call these universal injunctions. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1664.44s)]
*  Decision was six to three. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1669.44s)]
*  The decision was written by Barrett. She did a good job. Credit where credit's due. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1671.44s)]
*  That's what I do. Credit where credit's due. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1674.44s)]
*  Discredit where discredit's due. But here credit where credit's due. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1677.44s)]
*  It's an excellent opinion. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1680.44s)]
*  But then you need to read Justice Jackson's dissent. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1686.44s)]
*  There's other dissents. Sotomayor. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1689.44s)]
*  She's probably the dumbest member of the court, I thought. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1691.44s)]
*  But Jackson is actually the dumbest. She's also the most radical. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1694.44s)]
*  She's a bomb thrower. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1697.44s)]
*  She used to be one of these district court judges. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1698.44s)]
*  Radical leftists in Washington, D.C. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1701.44s)]
*  When you read her very lengthy for a for a dissent, a concurring dissent, in other words, not the main dissent. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1706.44s)]
*  It's almost as if she's completely unhinged. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1717.44s)]
*  In the way she writes this thing. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1722.44s)]
*  Now, Justice Kagan, who a few years ago spoke out against these these types of injunctions, she voted with the radicals, the three of them. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1726.44s)]
*  So she's a flat out hypocrite. That's what she is. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1734.44s)]
*  She's a partisan Democrat hypocrite. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1737.44s)]
*  And Sotomayor is just a dummy. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1740.44s)]
*  So anyway, think about if the Supreme Court had gone the other way, if it had shrine these kinds of practices, they really. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1742.44s)]
*  You know, judiciary acts. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1752.44s)]
*  Congress has not empowered these courts to do these things. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1754.44s)]
*  These courts that Congress has invented, the Constitution doesn't do it. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1757.44s)]
*  And so they've seized this power, as we've talked about at length many times now. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1761.44s)]
*  Imagine if the court said OK in some form or way. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1767.44s)]
*  That means more courts would do this. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1773.44s)]
*  That means your vote really wouldn't matter. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1775.44s)]
*  That means the office of the presidency would be denuded, absolutely denuded. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1778.44s)]
*  It means that what your framers of the Constitution in Philadelphia rejected. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1785.44s)]
*  Would become constitutionalized without an amendment to the Constitution. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1793.44s)]
*  That is, these judges overlooking the shoulder of a president. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1797.44s)]
*  Now, keep in mind, they won't do it to a Biden or Obama or Clinton. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1802.44s)]
*  That is a Democrat president, only a Republican president, and especially an effective one like Trump. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1806.44s)]
*  She had a very good point. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1817.44s)]
*  One of the best things she said in this opinion, Barrett, I might add. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1819.44s)]
*  Some say that the universal injunction gives the judiciary a powerful tool to check the executive branch. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1827.44s)]
*  But federal courts do not exercise general oversight of the executive branch. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1836.44s)]
*  They resolve cases and controversies consistent with the authority Congress has given to them. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1842.44s)]
*  When a court concludes that the executive branch has acted unlawfully, the answer is not for the court to exceed its power, too. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1850.44s)]
*  This is a crucial point that we've talked about repeatedly. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1857.44s)]
*  But I like the way she phrases it. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1863.44s)]
*  Federal courts do not exercise general oversight of the executive branch. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1867.44s)]
*  That's not their job. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1872.44s)]
*  It's certainly not the job of one of nearly 700 lower federal district courts. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1874.44s)]
*  What's going on here, folks? [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1884.44s)]
*  Well, before I explain that, I want to get to the other case that was issued. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1887.44s)]
*  Incredible case. Six to three. Same six, same three. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1891.44s)]
*  This time Alito wrote the decision. Did a fantastic job. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1897.44s)]
*  Just to summarize, Montgomery County in Maryland is one of the most radical counties in America. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1901.44s)]
*  It's run by a bunch of mostly white leftist Democrats. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1907.44s)]
*  And so what happened here is you had the school board imposing LGBTQ plus and other and other agendas into the classroom curriculum and teaching in elementary school. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1912.44s)]
*  You had Orthodox Jews, you had Muslims, you had practicing Catholics, and you had other people who just said, wait a minute. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1929.44s)]
*  And so the district policy was to inform parents that the parents could pull their kids out of those courses when they're given. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1937.44s)]
*  The problem is they couldn't have a class because the vast majority of the parents were pulling their kids out of the class. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1947.44s)]
*  And so the school board decided, you know what? [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1953.44s)]
*  We're not going to inform you. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1957.44s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1959.44s)]
*  The school board decided, you know what? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1961.44s)]
*  We're not going to inform you. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1964.44s)]
*  And you can't pull the kids out of the class. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1966.44s)]
*  It's mandatory. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1969.44s)]
*  And so these folks said, wait a minute. We have a right in the First Amendment, the free exercise of religion. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1973.44s)]
*  You take our kids, you put this poison in their minds, a seven year old, a six year old, an eight and nine year old. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1977.44s)]
*  We're not going to put up with this. This is our school system. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1983.44s)]
*  Montgomery County School Board said too damn bad. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1987.44s)]
*  Live with it. And by the way, if you don't like it, send your kids to private school or parochial school. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1990.44s)]
*  So they sued. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=1999.44s)]
*  Went all the way to the Supreme Court. Six to three decision. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2001.44s)]
*  Lolito saying no, no, no, no. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2005.44s)]
*  If the free exercise of religion means anything, it means this. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2009.44s)]
*  And so do parental rights. This was a massive decision. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2013.44s)]
*  Six to three. Now, what's the problem with these two decisions? [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2018.44s)]
*  We're happy with the outcomes, right? But what's the problem with them? [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2022.44s)]
*  What's the problem with them, Mr. Perdue? [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2025.44s)]
*  Even though the outcomes are right, I'm going to explain this when we return. I'll be right back. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2028.44s)]
*  President Trump is in Washington with a mandate from the American people to solve the border crisis, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2040.44s)]
*  reverse the effects of Biden inflation and restore American greatness. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2045.44s)]
*  But since January 20, judges across our country have consistently been blocking President Trump's attempts to fulfill his mandate. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2048.44s)]
*  The Heritage Foundation has been analyzing the situation and they've been able to identify the legal issues with these judges actions, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2056.44s)]

*  The ambassador before him, David Freeman. Outstanding. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2147.44s)]
*  But Huckabee, as you know, is a pastor. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2151.44s)]
*  One of the greatest defenders of the state of Israel I've ever met. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2156.44s)]
*  An evangelical Christian. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2162.44s)]
*  That's fantastic. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2165.44s)]
*  You have one of these evangelical Christians, who's a lady, who's fantastic. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2169.44s)]
*  And she got so sick and tired with Cotarleson, she called him out. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2175.44s)]
*  Used the anti-Semitism word. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2181.44s)]
*  And then he attacked her. And smeared her. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2186.44s)]
*  I don't understand it. I don't understand these people. Not just him. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2190.44s)]
*  There's a whole phalanx of them. Look at the guy running for mayor of New York. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2194.44s)]
*  He's another one. These people are out of the closet. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2197.44s)]
*  You know, we're in modern times now. We have videos, we have audios, we have people you can stick them on the internet. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2201.44s)]
*  They say these things, they interview certain people, they take certain positions. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2206.44s)]
*  And then when they're called on it, they deny it. Why do they deny it? [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2210.44s)]
*  Mr. Producer, why do they deny it? If you're a Jew hater, just don't worry about it. Say it. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2215.44s)]
*  It's okay. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2221.44s)]
*  Because we get it anyway. We understand. We really do. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2223.44s)]
*  We really do. Or if you hate America, and you love Putin, we get it. It's okay. We get it. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2228.44s)]
*  I don't mean it's okay okay, but it's okay to self-identify. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2234.44s)]
*  You're self-identifying. That's your legacy. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2238.44s)]
*  That's your legacy for the rest of time. You can't fix it. That's who you are. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2242.44s)]
*  It's like these racists and segregationists from the past. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2248.44s)]
*  They're in the books. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2253.44s)]
*  For what they are for the rest of time. Racists and segregationists during the Civil Rights movement. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2256.44s)]
*  That's who they are. That's what they are. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2261.44s)]
*  Doesn't matter how they try and spin it. That's how they'll be remembered. That's their legacy. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2264.44s)]
*  And there's no fixing it because there's nothing to fix. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2269.44s)]
*  Or if you're convicted of fraud and you confessed a fraud to get parts, that's who you are. That's your legacy. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2275.44s)]
*  I have nothing to do with it. I didn't do it. That's you. You did it. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2282.44s)]
*  So don't hide from who you are. Be proud of it. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2289.44s)]
*  Be proud. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2296.44s)]
*  Be proud of your pardon and your fraud, conviction and confession. Be proud. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2299.44s)]
*  Be proud of your bigotry and your anti-Semitism. Go ahead. Be proud. Put it out there. That's your legacy. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2305.44s)]
*  That's your family. Your next family. Your family. That's what you're going to be remembered for. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2310.44s)]
*  Like this guy running for mayor. I don't know what the hell is going to happen. I pray to God he doesn't win. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2319.44s)]
*  But he's an anti-Semite. He's a bigot. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2326.44s)]
*  He also thinks white neighborhoods should be taxed higher than other neighborhoods. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2329.44s)]
*  This guy's all in. He's all in. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2332.44s)]
*  And any Democrat that endorses him, any public Democrat who's known out there that endorses him, that's okay. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2335.44s)]
*  That's your legacy too. A global intifada? Are you kidding me? [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2341.44s)]
*  That's what he is. BDS? That's him. Students for Justice in Palestine, a Hamas front group? That's him. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2347.44s)]
*  And by the way, I don't see him running from it either. We'll be right back. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2355.44s)]

*  Now, broadcasting from the Underground Command Post, deep in the bowels of a hidden bunker, [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2384.44s)]
*  somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building, we once again make contact with our leader, Mark Levin. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2390.44s)]
*  What a great day. What a great day. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2401.44s)]
*  Hello, America. Mark Levin here. It's Friday. Our number is 877-381-3811. 877-381-3811. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2404.44s)]
*  The Israeli armed forces were successful. The American armed forces were successful. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2414.44s)]
*  We have a tremendous president of the United States. They have a tremendous prime minister of Israel. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2418.44s)]
*  These are good days. It doesn't normally line up so beautifully like this, America. It just doesn't. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2423.44s)]
*  The Iranian regime three weeks ago was all powerful. Today, it's on its knees. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2429.44s)]
*  The isolationists in America are all but dead. Their ideology has been repudiated by the president of the United States and everybody else. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2437.44s)]
*  The disgrace and the disaster. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2446.44s)]
*  The people who are red-blooded Americans who care about this country and understand, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2450.44s)]
*  understand that we want peace and sometimes you have to use the military shrewdly, intelligently, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2455.44s)]
*  in order to secure it against very, very evil enemies. Well, you won. 94% of you. 94%. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2461.44s)]
*  Now, I didn't mean to leave you in a cliffhanger this long. What is wrong with these two cases, that we won? [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2470.44s)]
*  Six to three both, same justices in the six and the three. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2476.44s)]
*  Religious, liberty and parental rights and the lower courts cannot issue these nationwide injunctions. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2481.44s)]
*  Now, they're going to have some sleazy ways to try and get around that, but I'll deal with that another day. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2491.44s)]
*  They do exist. They're not that easy. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2496.44s)]
*  Well, I'll just tell you now, Alito pointed them out in his concurring opinion and he said, [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2499.44s)]
*  look, there's two things to worry about here. I'm all in on this decision. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2503.44s)]
*  The third party standing and these so-called class cases that you bring. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2508.44s)]
*  Third party standing. What does that mean? [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2516.44s)]
*  A third party goes to a lower court judge and says, hey, we think we have standing to be involved in this case, even if they may not. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2518.44s)]
*  And he's saying these same judges, and I'm reading between the lines, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2525.44s)]
*  these same judges who were reckless enough to try and destroy separation of powers, to seize the power of a president, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2528.44s)]
*  to undermine the outcome of an election, to issue these nationwide injunctions. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2538.44s)]
*  They're going to try and exploit the whole issue of third party standing, that is, by liberally interpreting it to bring as many people in as they can. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2546.44s)]
*  Or these class action suits. Now, there's a rule 23, 23A that lays out with particularity how you get part, can be part of a class action suit. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2556.44s)]
*  It's not so simple unless, of course, you're making the case to what? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2566.44s)]
*  One of these radical left wing judges. So the problem is these judges are not going away. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2570.44s)]
*  They're lawless. They're radical Democrat lawyers in black robes. They're lawless. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2577.44s)]
*  But there's a bigger problem. What's wrong with these two cases? [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2584.44s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, these two cases, the fact that the president had to bring the case involving these universal or national injunctions [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2590.44s)]
*  and the fact that the issue of parental rights and not exposing elementary school children to perversions and sexuality and God knows what, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2604.44s)]
*  they should have never been necessary. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2614.44s)]
*  We're celebrating, rightly, two victories. Two victories that just bring us back to normality. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2619.44s)]
*  In other words, these lower courts were so out of control. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2628.44s)]
*  This school board was so out of control that we now consider a victory to put them back in the lane where they're supposed to be. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2638.44s)]
*  What these judges were doing, the extent with them, I understand it started in the 60s, but really the hyper extent of these kinds of orders that they issued, [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2647.44s)]
*  really over the last 10 to 15 years. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2656.44s)]
*  We shouldn't even have had them doing these things. This school board, destroying parental rights, destroying the free exercise of religion in a most grotesque way. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2661.44s)]
*  25 years ago that didn't even happen. So these cases show what? [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2673.44s)]
*  The degradation of our culture and our society. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2680.44s)]
*  And that we have to celebrate a win when there should never have been a case if we were living in a healthy culture and society. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2684.44s)]
*  You see my point, Mr. Producer? [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2690.44s)]
*  Nobody's really talking about this. It is big that we won both of these cases. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2695.44s)]
*  But it is sad, problematic that these cases had to even exist. That's my point. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2702.44s)]
*  And it shows. It shows what's happening to our constitutional republic. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2712.44s)]
*  It shows what's happening to the morality in our society and parental rights versus governmental rights over our children. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2718.44s)]
*  These were six to three decisions. They were not nine to zero. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2726.44s)]
*  And these three radical justices, they wrote very emotional cases, responses and dissents. Very emotional dissents. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2729.44s)]
*  They're all in. And if they get two more, that's it. That's it. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2742.44s)]
*  We're not going to win every presidential election. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2750.44s)]
*  And they're going to be replacing good justices with bad justices at some point. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2755.44s)]
*  But the level to which our society has been denigrated, our culture has been denigrated is so bad. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2760.44s)]
*  So bad that these cases had to be brought to push back in the first place. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2770.44s)]
*  And secondly, we won't always win. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2776.44s)]
*  This was the dream of the early progressives, aka American Marxists. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2784.44s)]
*  This too is discussed in my book On Power. This is the dream. I spent a lot of time on Wilson. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2792.44s)]
*  Rule by the judiciary that can create the creation of the fourth branch, the bureaucracy. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2799.44s)]
*  In other words, rule by the unelected. Remember what I said at the opening of the program. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2804.44s)]
*  These judges are still there. They're still going to do terrible things. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2808.44s)]
*  They're still going to do terrible things. And they will have avenues to do it. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2816.44s)]
*  And they will have avenues to do it. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2822.44s)]
*  They're still going to attack Trump and attack Trump policies. Why? [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2827.44s)]
*  Number one, he's a Republican. They're radical, partisan Democrats, just like Kagan today. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2831.44s)]
*  But number two, Trump is the most effective president [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2838.44s)]
*  in pushing back against the establishment, the ruling class. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2843.44s)]
*  Ever. Ever. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2849.44s)]
*  We talked about this. That's why these judges rule time and again to protect the fourth branch of government. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2855.44s)]
*  That's not even in the Constitution. To protect their programs, to protect their fraud, their waste, their bloat. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2860.44s)]
*  To protect every single member, every single employee. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2866.44s)]
*  To protect their computers and the information on their computers to the public. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2870.44s)]
*  To protect their data, to make it impossible to fire any of them and on and on and on. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2874.44s)]
*  That's their empire. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2879.44s)]
*  That's what they're protecting. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2884.44s)]
*  This is what Wilson and the early American Marxists wanted. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2888.44s)]
*  This is why Kagan and Sotomayor and especially Jackson, the most radical of the bunch. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2892.44s)]
*  This is why they were so angry and so upset. Wait a minute. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2898.44s)]
*  Our fellow judges at the trial level, the lower court judges, are protecting what? [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2902.44s)]
*  The American Marxist agenda. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2909.44s)]
*  And they're furious, these three justices. Furious. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2915.44s)]
*  And Jackson, being the most radical of the three, and that's saying something. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2919.44s)]
*  She lost her head, in her opinion. Lost it. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2923.44s)]
*  Lost it. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2928.44s)]
*  That's what's going on. That's why I said celebrate these cases, but there's a bigger story here. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2933.44s)]
*  Much bigger. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2940.44s)]
*  And it's a huge problem. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2943.44s)]
*  President Trump today. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2946.44s)]
*  And by the way, if Donald Trump hadn't challenged it, this would be going on and on and on. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2950.44s)]
*  And keep in mind, he is following court orders. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2954.44s)]
*  The courts are not following the Constitution. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2957.44s)]
*  Cut one, go. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2960.44s)]
*  This morning, the Supreme Court has delivered a monumental victory for the Constitution, [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2962.44s)]
*  the separation of powers and the rule of law. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2968.44s)]
*  In striking down the excessive use of nationwide injunctions to interfere with the normal functioning of the executive branch, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2971.44s)]
*  the Supreme Court has stopped the presidency itself. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2979.44s)]
*  That's what they've done. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2982.44s)]
*  And really, it's been an amazing period of time, this last hour. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2984.44s)]
*  There are people elated all over the country. I've seen such happiness in spirit. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2991.44s)]
*  Sometimes you don't see that, but this case is very important. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=2997.44s)]
*  I was elected on a historic mandate, but in recent months we've seen a handful of radical left judges effectively try to overrule [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3000.44s)]
*  the rightful powers of the president to stop the American people from getting the policies that they voted for in record numbers. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3008.44s)]
*  It was a grave threat to democracy, frankly, and instead of merely ruling on the immediate cases before them, [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3016.44s)]
*  these judges have attempted to dictate the law for the entire nation. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3023.44s)]
*  In practice, this meant that if any one of the nearly 700 federal judges disagreed with the policy of a duly elected president [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3028.44s)]
*  of the United States, he or she could block that policy from going into effect or at least delay it for many years, tie it up in the court system. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3036.44s)]
*  This was a colossal abuse of power which never occurred in American history prior to recent decades, [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3046.44s)]
*  and we've been hit with more nationwide injunctions than were issued in the entire 20th century together. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3053.44s)]
*  Think of it more than the entire 20th century. Me. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3060.44s)]
*  I'm grateful to the Supreme Court for stepping in and solving this very, very big and complex problem, and they've made it very simple. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3064.44s)]
*  Cut to go. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3076.44s)]
*  Thanks to this decision, we can now promptly file to proceed with numerous policies that have been wrongly enjoined on a nationwide basis. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3077.44s)]
*  And some of the cases we're talking about would be ending birthright citizenship, which now comes to the fore. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3087.44s)]
*  That was meant for the babies of slaves. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3094.44s)]
*  It wasn't meant for people trying to scam the system and come into the country on a vacation. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3097.44s)]
*  This was in fact, it was the same date, the exact same date, the end of the Civil War was meant for the babies of slaves and it's so clean and so obvious. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3102.44s)]
*  But this lets us go there and finally win that case because hundreds of thousands of people are pouring into our country under birthright citizenship. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3110.44s)]
*  And it wasn't meant for that reason was meant for the babies of slaves. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3119.44s)]
*  So thanks to this decision, we can now probably file to proceed with these numerous policies and those that have been wrongly enjoined on a nationwide basis, [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3123.44s)]
*  including birthright citizenship, ending sanctuary city funding, suspending refugee resettlement, freezing unnecessary funding, [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3134.44s)]
*  stopping federal taxpayers from paying for transgender surgeries and numerous other priorities of the American people. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3143.44s)]
*  They could have taken up birthright citizenship today as well, but I guess they figured out that they've already bitten off more than they can chew. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3152.44s)]
*  Probably wise actually, because we're going to lose a few of these justices. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3160.44s)]
*  I'm convinced when it comes to that decision, unfortunately. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3164.44s)]
*  But there's a very heavy political pressure. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3168.44s)]
*  A lot of people involved and I think they'll buckle to that. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3172.44s)]
*  But today they stood up and they deserve credit when credit is deserved. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3175.44s)]
*  And they stood up in two very important cases, actually other cases too, but these in particular. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3181.44s)]
*  It's not a conservative court. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3187.44s)]
*  Conservative conservatism is a political philosophy. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3190.44s)]
*  This is about constitutionalism. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3195.44s)]
*  That's their job. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3199.44s)]
*  They did their job. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3201.44s)]
*  Six of them did their job. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3203.44s)]
*  The other three are wild maniacs. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3205.44s)]
*  Don't forget to set your DVRs. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3209.44s)]
*  These shows this weekend, 8 p.m. Eastern, both nights, are really powerful. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3212.44s)]
*  Saturday night show is extremely patriotic. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3218.44s)]
*  Extremely patriotic. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3222.44s)]
*  You're going to really like it. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3224.44s)]
*  With our friend Duke Enrich and our friend Colonel Richard Kemp. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3226.44s)]
*  But it's very patriotic from the opening statement to the end. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3231.44s)]
*  And our Sunday program, absolutely killer. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3235.44s)]
*  We dig into these cases as well as more with Mr. Conservative, Mr. Conservative, Ted Cruz, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3238.44s)]
*  and Julian Epstein who is an outstanding gentleman who I've known for several decades, [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3246.44s)]
*  although we got reacquainted here because we haven't kept in touch. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3253.44s)]
*  He's a very moderate Democrat and he's very upset about what's taking place in the party. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3258.44s)]
*  And I feel it's time that we give folks like him a little bit more airing. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3262.44s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3266.44s)]

*  All right, just opening this here. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3345.44s)]
*  The president sent me this a couple hours ago. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3350.44s)]
*  He posted it on True Social. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3355.44s)]
*  Why would the so-called supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khomeini, of the war-torn country of Iran, [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3357.44s)]
*  say so blatantly and foolishly that he won the war with Israel? [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3365.44s)]
*  When he knows his statement is a lie, it's not so. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3370.44s)]
*  It's just like the isolationists think they won something. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3374.44s)]
*  They've disgraced themselves. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3377.44s)]
*  His country was decimated. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3380.44s)]
*  His three evil nuclear sites were obliterated. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3382.44s)]
*  And I knew exactly where he was sheltered and would not let Israel or the U.S. armed forces, [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3385.44s)]
*  by far the greatest and most powerful in the world, terminate his life. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3390.44s)]
*  I saved him from a very ugly and ignominious death. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3394.44s)]
*  And he does not have to say, thank you, President Trump. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3400.44s)]
*  In fact, in the final act of war, I demanded that Israel bring back a very large group of planes, [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3404.44s)]
*  which were heading directly to Tehran, looking for a big day, perhaps the final knockout. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3410.44s)]
*  Tremendous damage would have ensued and many Iranians would have been killed. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3416.44s)]
*  It's going to be the biggest attack of the war, by far. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3421.44s)]
*  During the last few days, I was working on the possible removal of sanctions and other things, [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3425.44s)]
*  which would have given a much better chance to Iran at full, fast and complete recovery. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3431.44s)]
*  The sanctions are biting. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3437.44s)]
*  But no, instead I get hit with a statement of anger, hatred and disgust, [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3439.44s)]
*  and immediately dropped all work on sanctions relief and more. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3443.44s)]
*  Iran has got to get back into the world order flow, or things will only get worse for them. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3447.44s)]
*  Can you imagine what the boneheaded isolationists would do if Trump whacks them again, Mr. Bidusar? [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3452.44s)]
*  I mean, I think they'll car their friends in Qatar and Putin. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3459.44s)]
*  I think they might even move to one of these enemy countries. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3464.44s)]
*  A burned out, blown up country with no future, a decimated military, a horrible economy and death all around them. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3468.44s)]
*  They have no hope. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3473.44s)]
*  It'll only get worse. I wish the leadership in Iran would realize how to get to peace. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3475.44s)]

*  She's written a book called Butler, The Untold Story, The Near Assassination of President Trump and the Fight for America's Heartland. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3624.44s)]

*  And we love Selena. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3637.44s)]
*  Just down to the earth, soul of the earth, as they say. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3640.44s)]
*  We also have Gianno Caldwell, later in the program. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3645.44s)]
*  A fantastic young man. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3651.44s)]
*  You can see the anguish in his face every time he talks about his little brother who was murdered. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3654.44s)]
*  And he's tried to, to use such a horrendous event to bring attention to this problem [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3660.44s)]
*  and all the people who are suffering from it. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3670.44s)]
*  The day my brother was murdered, my journey through America's violent crime crisis. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3674.44s)]
*  And this is propitious, too. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3679.44s)]
*  I mean, you got a guy running for mayor in New York who wants to defund the NYPD. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3682.44s)]
*  I mean, the guy gets over 40 percent of the vote in the Democrat primary. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3686.44s)]
*  Now, I understand that's 10 percent of the vote of all the voters in the city, but it is what it is. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3690.44s)]
*  And here's my concern. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3696.44s)]
*  Cuomo staying in, Eric Adams is staying in, our buddy Slee was in. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3700.44s)]
*  I don't see how this guy doesn't lose unless two of these guys get out. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3708.44s)]
*  Am I wrong, Rich? [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3712.44s)]
*  Now, Slee with to me is the best shot. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3716.44s)]
*  And you'd want the moderate Democrats, the Republicans or anybody who doesn't want this guy. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3719.44s)]
*  They could rally around him and so forth. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3724.44s)]
*  But Cuomo, who blew it in the Democrat primary, who ran a horrendous campaign, [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3727.44s)]
*  who's got so much crap going on in his background. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3731.44s)]
*  It's just a lousy situation there. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3736.44s)]
*  And Adams, Adams has all the excitement of a tangerine. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3740.44s)]
*  The guy is and not only that, his record is mixed. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3747.44s)]
*  But whatever it is, it is. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3753.44s)]
*  I just wish these three guys would sit down and figure it out because otherwise New York City is going to be destroyed. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3754.44s)]
*  I really believe this. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3762.44s)]
*  I really believe this. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3764.44s)]
*  It's very worrisome. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3768.44s)]
*  It should wear everybody throughout the country, quite frankly. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3770.44s)]
*  Everybody throughout the country. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3773.44s)]
*  That you would basically have a minority candidate. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3776.44s)]
*  I don't mean his race, for God's sake. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3779.44s)]
*  I mean in terms of the percentage of the vote. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3781.44s)]
*  It might be a plurality, but still a minority of the voters slip in. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3784.44s)]
*  I won't tell you how that got one guy into power because people will take it the wrong way. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3790.44s)]
*  It's amazing to know history and to have to hide history. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3797.44s)]
*  It's just like the battle of the isolationists. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3800.44s)]
*  All seven of them. Seven of them. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3802.44s)]
*  The battle of history versus absolute ignorance and stupidity. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3805.44s)]
*  That's the way it goes, I guess. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3812.44s)]
*  All right, let's see here. Oh, yes. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3815.44s)]
*  Hold on now. Hold on now. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3820.44s)]
*  I'm looking here. I wanted to get something. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3822.44s)]
*  Let's see. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3824.44s)]
*  Stick with me. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3826.44s)]
*  Okay. No, no, no. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3828.44s)]
*  Nope. Nope. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3832.44s)]
*  Excuse me. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3835.44s)]
*  We have a little problem with the Senate parliamentarian. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3838.44s)]
*  Now this parliamentarian, as I understand it, was originally appointed by the Democrats. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3841.44s)]
*  And she's making some rulings that are very not just problematic, devastating to the president's agenda, to your agenda, my agenda. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3848.44s)]
*  And she can be fired by Mr. Thune, by John Thune, or they can bowl over her. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3858.44s)]
*  But of course, we want to keep the traditions of the Senate being what they are these days. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3865.44s)]
*  And Catherine Salgado. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3870.44s)]
*  I used to know somebody named Salgado. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3872.44s)]
*  Who the hell was it? Decades ago. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3874.44s)]
*  She writes, Hey, GOP, Senate parliamentarian isn't binding. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3879.44s)]
*  Port news flash for the Senate GOP. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3884.44s)]
*  The recommendations of the woke Senate parliamentarian who's trying to ensure that absolutely no financial reform is enacted are not binding. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3886.44s)]
*  Senate Majority Leader John Thune has said he's not going to challenge the outrageous decisions of the Senate parliamentarian. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3893.44s)]
*  She's a bureaucrat. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3899.44s)]
*  And no doubt he'd like you to believe there's no option otherwise. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3901.44s)]
*  That is simply untrue. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3904.44s)]
*  There are multiple ways of overruling the unelected Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth McDonough's decisions. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3906.44s)]
*  As voters, it's very important we understand the legal realities of our system and not give our elected representatives a pass just because they claimed helplessness. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3913.44s)]
*  As the Washington Examiner explained, the parliamentarian is merely a staffer who serves at the discretion of the Senate. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3923.44s)]
*  Any suggestion, ruling they make, any suggested ruling they make is not binding on the Senate. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3930.44s)]
*  She's supposed to advise the Senate on following their own rules and the laws, which, according to her, include using taxpayer dollars to fund transgender treatments and illegal aliens. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3936.44s)]
*  Which is unconstitutional, of course, among many other things, but don't just take my word for it or the examiners. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3946.44s)]
*  Below is a direct, is direct from the Library of Congress, quote, [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3953.44s)]
*  Neither the House or Senate parliamentarians are empowered to make decisions that are binding on the House or the Senate. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3957.44s)]
*  And by the way, they can't be because it would violate the Constitution. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3965.44s)]
*  She's not in the Constitution. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3968.44s)]
*  The parliamentarians and their deputies assistants only offer advice that the presiding representative or senator may accept or reject. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3971.44s)]
*  Individual members may appeal rulings. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3978.44s)]
*  And there you have it. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3981.44s)]
*  Thune absolutely does not have to accept McDonough's rulings. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3982.44s)]
*  And even individual senators can appeal her rulings. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3986.44s)]
*  Vice President J.D. Vance can also overrule her as president of the Senate. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3989.44s)]
*  And yes, her decisions are seriously problematic and should be rejected. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3993.44s)]
*  As just a single example, Breitbart reported on June 26 as follows. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=3998.44s)]
*  Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth McDonough ruled the Medicaid provider tax would require 60 votes in the Senate to be included in the big, beautiful bill. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4005.44s)]
*  The Senate parliamentarians ruling complicates the offsets for enhancing and extending the Trump tax cuts. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4013.44s)]
*  The parliamentarian also struck down provisions that would bar the use of Medicaid funds for transgender health care services and to prevent illegal aliens from receiving Medicaid or CHIP health care coverage. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4019.44s)]
*  So this one bureaucrat who's a staffer effectively makes these decisions because she knows that it won't get past the filibuster in the Senate with the Democrats. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4030.44s)]
*  And what I'm saying, what PJ Media's saying, what Breitbart's saying, what the Examiner is saying is, why? [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4041.44s)]
*  She's not in the Constitution. Do your damn constitutional duty. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4050.44s)]
*  You heard her advice, now reject it. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4054.44s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4060.44s)]
*  Congressional Republicans have a tendency to back down from vitally important fights that they can win. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4061.44s)]
*  Thune doesn't have to obey the discretion and the decisions that McKenna has made and other Republican senators can appeal her decisions. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4068.44s)]
*  America simply can't afford to keep wasting money we don't have on utterly unconstitutional and unjustified woke programs and foreign lawbreakers. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4075.44s)]
*  And she's right. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4087.44s)]
*  I'll be right back. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4092.44s)]
*  Pure Talk, my wireless company, a veteran-led company, believes every man and woman who has faithfully served this country deserves to proudly fly an American flag that was made in America. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4097.44s)]

*  All right, Mr. Producer, I want you to play Cut 9, the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Supreme Nazi leader of Iran via translator. Cut 9, go. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4167.44s)]
*  The US president said that Iran should surrender. That means there's no more enrichment. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4180.44s)]
*  A great Iran and the word of surrender, they don't match. They don't match with each other. It's a joke. It's a ridiculous thing to say. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4190.44s)]
*  Is he still hiding, by the way? Is he still hiding out? [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4200.44s)]
*  The Israelis wanted to take him out, Trump stopped them. So I'm just curious. Does he understand what he owes the president? Does he care? See what I mean, America? [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4205.44s)]
*  This guy is a rat. He's a cockroach. Go ahead. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4214.44s)]
*  The fact that the Islamic Republic has access to important American centers in the region and can take action against them whenever it deems necessary is not a small incident. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4219.44s)]
*  It is a major incident, and this incident can be repeated in the future. If an attack is made, the cost to the enemy and the victim will definitely be high. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4230.44s)]
*  Well, let's say they start enriching nuclear fissile material again for a nuclear bomb. I think they should be hit again, don't you, Mr. Producer? [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4240.44s)]
*  And hard. And you know who grieves with the America? The president of the United States. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4249.44s)]
*  The isolationists now are wetting themselves as if they're Joe Biden, except they don't wear Depends. But maybe they do. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4256.44s)]
*  Especially Gates. He doesn't even wear pants. Well, you just never know. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4264.44s)]
*  But let's take a listen. Here's the president. If they start enriching again, would you bomb them again, Mr. President? Cut eight. Go. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4269.44s)]
*  If if the intelligence reports conclude that Iran can enrich uranium to a level that concerns you, would you consider bombing the country again? [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4277.44s)]
*  Without question, absolutely. And how do you add any? It has to be unbelievable. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4288.44s)]
*  But, you know, our incredible flyers and our I call them the shots. These guys are unbelievable. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4293.44s)]
*  Think from 52,000 feet, they hit the equivalent of a refrigerator door. They actually hit it right in the center. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4300.44s)]
*  So it's much smaller than that. And just bomb after bomb going deeper, deeper, blowing up. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4306.44s)]
*  Incredible, incredible thing. I don't know if you heard the general is very impressive. Raising came. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4312.44s)]
*  Wow, Mr. Producer, that's going to upset the the the mental midgets out there. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4319.44s)]
*  Absolutely. Because Donald Trump believes in protecting America from Islamo Nazis with nuclear weapons and they don't. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4326.44s)]
*  That's our president, Maga. You agree with them. Ninety four percent of you. That's who we stand with. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4334.44s)]
*  He's so great, isn't he? He's great president. It's what he is. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4342.44s)]
*  And they hate him for it. They backstabbed. They said he's complicit. Starting World War Three. You believe that? [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4346.44s)]
*  You believe these people? Well, that's what they said. That's what they meant. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4353.44s)]
*  All right, let's keep moving. We got a lot to do here. And I love it. I love it. Love it. Love it. Let's go to let's see him. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4361.44s)]
*  Let's talk about the Ayatollah Khomeini still at it. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4368.44s)]
*  No, let's go to Chris Murphy close. He's this Democrat senator who, you know, I despise. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4373.44s)]
*  And you should despise him, too. He's an isolationist, too. I think he'll get a podcast at some point. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4380.44s)]
*  Let's check this out. Cut 11 go. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4389.44s)]
*  The strikes potentially could have the impact of convincing this regime in Tehran or the next regime that they now have no choice but to rush to a nuclear weapon. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4393.44s)]
*  And we already know that they have some capabilities that are so far underground that we can never reach them. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4404.44s)]
*  So they have he has no idea about that. Number one. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4412.44s)]
*  Number two, he went on TV over and over again and told you that Joe Biden is the sharpest tack. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4415.44s)]
*  Number three, he told you to ignore under Biden's laptop. He's a liar. He's a serial pathological liar. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4421.44s)]
*  That's what he is. And he's an isolationist. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4429.44s)]
*  They're all serial pathological liars. These isolationists. That's what they are. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4434.44s)]
*  Trump's not an isolationist. Reagan wasn't an isolationist. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4439.44s)]
*  Secretary of Defense and State. They're not isolationist. I'm not an isolationist. You're not an isolationist either. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4442.44s)]
*  That's you might as well be a. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4449.44s)]
*  You might as well be suicidal. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4453.44s)]
*  Suicidal. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4456.44s)]
*  Now, these guys, they want to take the rest of us with them. We're not going. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4459.44s)]
*  Ain't happening. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4464.44s)]
*  OK. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4465.44s)]
*  And I wanted you to hear this guy, Chris Murphy. He's dumber than he looks. He looks pretty dumb. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4467.44s)]
*  All right, Richie Rich, I'm looking. I found it. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4474.44s)]
*  I've got all these cases. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4478.44s)]
*  And the dissents. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4481.44s)]
*  And I read them. I don't just read the articles about them, but they're spread out all over my desk. So. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4483.44s)]
*  One of these days, I think we're going to put a video camera here and then we'll kick out our kick out our podcast. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4489.44s)]
*  And we'll drive it to the top of the podcast out there. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4496.44s)]
*  By the way, have you noticed these podcasters keep interviewing each other, Mr. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4500.44s)]
*  Have you seen this? [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4503.44s)]
*  Have you noticed that the same five people? [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4505.44s)]
*  I'm on the fraud room. I'm in the Carlson. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4508.44s)]
*  Oh, there's the dumbest member of Congress. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4511.44s)]
*  It's like they keep moving around and interviewing each other. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4513.44s)]
*  And then they keep getting headlines. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4515.44s)]
*  Oh, this one said this. It's hilarious. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4517.44s)]
*  They don't even realize they're being mocked. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4519.44s)]
*  It's so. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4521.44s)]
*  It's funny. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4523.44s)]
*  Very funny. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4525.44s)]
*  Israel. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4527.44s)]
*  He's here. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4529.44s)]
*  He's here. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4531.44s)]
*  Now broadcasting from the underground command post. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4533.44s)]
*  Deep in the underground command post. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4537.44s)]
*  He's here. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4538.44s)]
*  Now broadcasting from the underground command post. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4540.44s)]
*  Deep in the bowels of a hidden bunker. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4544.44s)]
*  Somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4547.44s)]
*  We've once again made contact with our leader. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4551.44s)]
*  Mark LePen. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4554.44s)]
*  You know, Gianna Caldwell from Fox. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4558.44s)]
*  Some of you know him from other places too. He's a very honorable young man. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4561.44s)]
*  Unfortunately, his family was struck by a horrendous tragedy. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4564.44s)]
*  And unfortunately, too many families are. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4568.44s)]
*  When his little brother was murdered. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4571.44s)]
*  And he has a fantastic book out. The Day My Brother Was Murdered. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4574.44s)]
*  My Journey Through America's Violent Crime Crisis. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4578.44s)]
*  I'll bet you never thought you'd have to write a book like this, my brother, did you? [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4581.44s)]
*  No, I did not. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4586.44s)]
*  And it's such an honor to be on what you mark. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4588.44s)]
*  You're a warrior of truth. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4591.44s)]
*  You're a warrior of truth and thank you for having me. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4592.44s)]
*  You know, June, it would be an absolute honor for me. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4595.44s)]
*  On June 24, 2022, my life changed forever when my innocent teenage baby brother, Christian, was murdered on the south side of Chicago. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4599.44s)]
*  And since then, I have been out for justice. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4607.44s)]
*  Not just for him, but other people who have experienced these same tragedies. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4611.44s)]
*  And I created the Caldwell Institute for Public Safety, the Caldwell Institute.org. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4617.44s)]
*  I encourage people to go and support our efforts there to ensure that George Soros funded progressive prosecutors no longer have a foothold in our country. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4622.44s)]
*  These are individuals who my family personally knows policies lead to death and destruction, unfortunately. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4632.44s)]
*  And we have had to live with this terrible reality, but we wanted to turn pain into purpose. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4641.44s)]
*  And I wrote this book, The Day My Brother Was Murdered, My Journey Through America's Violent Crime Crisis, because I wanted to examine what happened on that day across the country. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4648.44s)]
*  Many people don't know it, but 150 people were murdered across the country that day. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4658.44s)]
*  So I went and I took eight families, plus my own, and I wrote about their stories and highlighted those because I wanted people to know what the injustice looks like through these progressives and their destructive policies. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4663.44s)]
*  But I also wanted to talk about solutions. So I talked to people like John Walsh from America's Most Wanted. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4680.44s)]
*  I talked to our very own Sean Hannity, our dear friend. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4686.44s)]
*  I talked to Dr. Drew Pinsky about the mental health crisis, educators, faith leaders, because we have to turn this ship around. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4688.44s)]
*  If we don't want to end up in a place like New York, end up with a socialist mayor who will absolutely cause death and destruction by defunding the police, ending cash bail, ending the prison system. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4696.44s)]
*  We're talking about Gotham City here. Chicago's already experienced in a similar reality. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4710.44s)]
*  We have to change course for the entire country. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4715.44s)]
*  Is it your sense that the sort of things you're talking about are starting to have residents and communities that typically are counted on to just vote straight Democrat, not raise issues? [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4718.44s)]
*  I'm starting to see even in places like Chicago where people are saying we've had enough of this. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4732.44s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. And I think the vote totals in the presidential election the last go told a really good story. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4737.44s)]
*  One in which President Donald Trump's message resonated with many people, including in Chicago. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4746.44s)]
*  He actually won a precinct that encompasses the Cook County Jail because the prisoners there are allowed to vote in those elections and people around in those neighborhoods voted for Trump. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4752.44s)]
*  It's one thing people usually don't know. And he did something that was very different. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4764.44s)]
*  I think it's something I've been telling Republicans for years. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4769.44s)]
*  I've been a conservative for almost 25 years now. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4772.44s)]
*  And I've been saying we got to go into those neighborhoods where we're not welcome, where we're not liked, where they call us names. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4776.44s)]
*  We got to go in there because it's going to be harder for people to demonize us if they met us. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4782.44s)]
*  That is the difference and Donald Trump has done it flawlessly. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4789.44s)]
*  So this institute your family put together in the book is fantastic, folks. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4793.44s)]
*  The day my brother was murdered, my journey through America's violent crime crisis. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4799.44s)]
*  You can get it on Amazon.com. The Institute does what on a day to day basis? [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4803.44s)]
*  I know you want to build it up bigger and get it, you know, obviously more funding and so forth. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4811.44s)]
*  So it has a bigger reach. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4815.44s)]
*  Yes, yes. Our focus is elections and what we do on a day to day basis. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4816.44s)]
*  We've been doing a lot of meetings. We just heard one years old what we have done. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4823.44s)]
*  George Gascogne, the race in Los Angeles, California. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4827.44s)]
*  We got behind Nathan Hockman, did I-Biz, opinion editorials, a lot of meetings. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4830.44s)]
*  We were down there on the ground with the teams out there. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4836.44s)]
*  And we wanted to ensure because I lived in Los Angeles at one time and I actually ended up not going back after COVID because of the crime there. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4840.44s)]
*  I live in Miami, Florida now. We got it done. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4850.44s)]
*  We ensured that Nathan Hockman had a place and I just had lunch with him the other day. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4854.44s)]
*  He's doing great. And those folks, those ICE protesters, those that were causing all that destruction, [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4860.44s)]
*  they're getting a different view of what life looks like with law and order prosecutor. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4865.44s)]
*  So I'm appreciative of those efforts, but we want to continue those efforts and obviously build up a whole lot more as you just mentioned, [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4872.44s)]
*  targeting races like Larry Kralzner or Alvin Bragg in New York City. And there's many, many others. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4880.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4886.44s)]
*  No, 100%. Absolutely. And that's why it's so important for conservatives to be loud on this issue of crime, soft on crime policies, [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4887.44s)]
*  because it can lead to the death of anyone that we know. I never thought that my brother would end up murdered. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4897.44s)]
*  It was the darkest moment of my life. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4903.44s)]
*  And you know what? Your suffering is on your face every time I see you. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4907.44s)]
*  You never get over it, do you? You never get over it, do you? [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4913.44s)]
*  No, no, absolutely not. And that's one of the things I discussed with Dr. Drew in the book. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4917.44s)]
*  I said, well, how do I move forward? How can I get beyond the pain? And he said, unfortunately you don't. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4923.44s)]
*  But what you can do is something in your brother's name, the further his legacy and that helps you. That will help you. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4929.44s)]
*  And he was exactly right. I haven't fully grieved my brother's murder. I've been on a constant path of let me fix it. Let me fix it. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4936.44s)]
*  It makes me feel like I'm doing something about what has caused such harm to my own family to ensure another family doesn't have that same experience. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4944.44s)]
*  And that was why the Caldwell Institute for Public Safety at Caldwellinstitute.org was so important. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4954.44s)]
*  Put that up there, Mr. Reducer. Caldwellinstitute.org. Let's make sure it's on all the platforms. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4961.44s)]
*  Gianna, can you explain? By the way, folks, it's all in the book and much, much more. We're barely touching the surface. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4967.44s)]
*  I want you to keep that in mind. The day my brother was murdered, my journey through America's violent crime crisis. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4977.44s)]
*  You can get it at Amazon.com. I encourage you to get it strongly. Tell us about your little brother. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4982.44s)]
*  Well, at 16 years old, he begged me to take him on a college tour. So we went out to, he wanted to check out UCLA. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4989.44s)]
*  We went out to Los Angeles, went to the tour of the school. He was very excited about planning his future. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=4998.44s)]
*  He saw a future beyond living in the city of Chicago. He wanted to be educated. He loved sports. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5005.44s)]
*  He was a little bit of a comedian, but many people in my family are. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5011.44s)]
*  And I got to tell you, I was excited about his future. I was hopeful. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5016.44s)]
*  I was hopeful that he would be maybe considerate of some of the work I do at Fox News as a Fox News political analyst, [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5022.44s)]
*  adjoining the conservative movement on the campaign side, really reaching out to the youth and his peer group to change the tide. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5029.44s)]
*  Because that's absolutely necessary. And I'm glad that that message that I gave him has resonated with some of my other siblings, [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5037.44s)]
*  like my brother, Matthew, who voted for Donald Trump and who was so excited to tell me that for the first time in his life, [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5045.44s)]
*  he voted and he voted for Trump and he told all his friends to vote for Donald Trump too. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5053.44s)]
*  We didn't grow up in a conservative household, not by any chance. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5057.44s)]
*  I learned about conservatism while having a conversation with an African American fellow on the street corners of Chicago. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5061.44s)]
*  And I had all the talking points that the Democrats gave us, the ones that they gave us at school, the ones that they gave us in our communities, [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5069.44s)]
*  the ones that the family has given us. Republicans don't care about poor people. They don't list any other. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5076.44s)]
*  And this African American gentleman challenged me and he was a Democrat. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5082.44s)]
*  And he said, did you know the first Republicans elected to Congress, black Republicans, black folks, were conservatives? [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5086.44s)]
*  No, I never heard of that before. Didn't know it. I didn't have any ideas that Martin Luther King was actually a conservative. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5095.44s)]
*  I didn't know that. I didn't. But once I'm challenged with something, if I don't have a response, I go and research in case the conversation comes up later [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5103.44s)]
*  and I have a stronger argument. And that's what I did. I went to Google. I looked at the differences between a Democrat and a Republican party. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5112.44s)]
*  And I found out the Republican party was started in 1854 in opposition to the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which wanted to expand slavery. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5120.44s)]
*  I learned how much of a pro-faith party it is, how we believe in dignity, hard work, and service. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5127.44s)]
*  And these are things that I grew up believing my entire life. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5136.44s)]
*  My grandfather, who was a small business owner, plumbing construction, often talked about how illegal immigration was coming into the communities [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5141.44s)]
*  and they were stealing the black folks' jobs, is what he said. And we see what happened today. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5150.44s)]
*  What's going on with the immigration fight today and what the Democrats have done, literally eviscerating the job market for many of those minorities. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5156.44s)]
*  They claim, we know they're lying because black lives don't matter to Democrats, black votes do. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5163.44s)]
*  They claim they're literally destroying the existence and work and ability for many of these folks in these communities that they usually get their votes from. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5170.44s)]
*  So these things that I learned over the years and it connected with me, it resonated with me, and then I had to deal with a little bit of depression [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5181.44s)]
*  because the folks in my community talk so badly about Republicans and I say, you know what, I'm one of them. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5189.44s)]
*  I can't be all of these negative things they say, but certainly I share these values. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5195.44s)]
*  And that's when I came out and I told my family, look, I'm a Republican. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5201.44s)]
*  And many of them didn't want anything to do with me. And as you can imagine, a lot of friends and family did neither. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5205.44s)]
*  But that's okay because you have to stand on principle. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5211.44s)]
*  You got to take these hard shots because it is necessary. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5215.44s)]
*  Folks, we got to go. I wish I didn't. I could listen to you all day, my friend. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5220.44s)]
*  This is a fantastic book by Gianna Caldwell, The Day My Brother Was Murdered, My Journey Through America's Violent Crime Crisis. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5226.44s)]
*  It's a, as Trump would say, a big beautiful book and it's got a lot of information in there that's very compelling. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5235.44s)]
*  It's a very beautifully written book. It's a beautiful tale and it's a very tragic tale in many respects too. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5242.44s)]
*  So go get it, Amazon.com, The Day My Brother Was Murdered. Just imagine having to write a book like that. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5248.44s)]
*  My Journey Through America's Violent Crime Crisis. I wish you all the best. I really do. God bless you. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5255.44s)]
*  Thank you. God bless you too, Mark. I'm praying for you. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5261.44s)]

*  Nobody smarter, nobody better than Ted Cruz and Julian Epstein. I want to introduce you to him. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5317.44s)]
*  He's a moderate Democrat. He has a lot of sensible things to say about his party. He's very concerned about it. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5323.44s)]
*  He's actually very pleased with what Donald Trump is doing. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5329.44s)]
*  But we need to bring people like Julian and Julian on the program so we can try and have an impact in that respect as well. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5332.44s)]
*  And I think we can and I think we will. And I hope you won't forget if you get over to Amazon.com, my book On Power, [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSlg_I5jzE&t=5340.44s)]
