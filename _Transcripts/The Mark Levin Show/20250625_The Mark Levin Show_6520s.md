Video Description: On Wednesday’s Mark Levin Show, Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City, is a Marxist and an Islamist who supports Hamas slogans, the BDS movement, and holds anti-Semitic views, though he reportedly denies these claims. If voted Mayor of NYC he will cause New York City's decline, with good people leaving and radical Islamists arriving.  Mamdani’s positions, including his criticism of Israel and Marxist beliefs, are incompatible with American values and pose a threat to New York City, particularly given its large Jewish population. Mamdani’s nomination reflects a broader strategy by Islamists to infiltrate American institutions. We need to confront these ideologies directly. Also, ‘Pardon Me’ Steve Bannon is deceiving hardworking, middle-class, blue-collar conservatives and MAGA supporters. Bannon is a con artist who leaked information against President Trump and his family, resulting in his White House dismissal in Trump’s first term. He is fake MAGA, exploiting the conservative movement for personal gain; we need to recognize his deception. He is the establishment and is undermining Trump's presidency. Later, Trump explained of Truth Social that he was shocked that there was an ongoing legal witch hunt against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, despite his leadership in a historic victory against Iran. Netanyahu is an unparalleled warrior who eliminated a significant nuclear threat. Trump demands the trial's immediate cancellation or a pardon for Netanyahu. Finally, Rep Byron Donalds calls in and defends Trump’s decision to neutralize Iranian nuclear sites, calling it the absolute right call and praises Trump for succeeding where past presidents, particularly Obama and Biden, failed by empowering Iran through misguided policies like those of Robert Malley. Donalds emphasizes Trump’s clear stance against Iran possessing nuclear weapons while avoiding ground troop deployment, aligning with an America First policy.

# Unmasking the Marxist-Islamist Alliance in America's Politics
**The Mark Levin Show:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0)
*  Ladies and gentlemen, this next segment of the podcast is brought to you by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=0.0s)]
*  For over 50 years, the Great Heritage Foundation has been America's outpost in Washington, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4.8s)]
*  fighting against the D.C. federal bureaucracy and working to secure a future that allows Americans [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=9.52s)]
*  to live the good life. For too long, common sense principles have been ignored by many of the very [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=14.64s)]
*  leaders claiming to fight for America, but the Heritage Foundation is proud to hold our leaders [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=19.28s)]
*  accountable and stand up for America's founding principles, paid for by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=23.6s)]
*  He's here. Now, broadcasting from the underground command post, deep in the bowels of a hidden [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=30.48s)]
*  bunker, somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=38.0s)]
*  we once again make contact with our leader, Mark LeVein. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=42.56s)]
*  Hello America, Mark LeVein here, our number 877-381-3811, 877-381-3811. Man, do we have a lot to do? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=120.0s)]
*  All I think you'll find compelling and important. This guy, Zoran [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=134.0s)]
*  Mamdani, is that it, Mr. Producer? I've got to make sure I learn how to pronounce his name. He's got [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=141.28s)]
*  the Democrat nomination. He is an Islamist, who embraces the terrorist slogan of Hamas, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=146.0s)]
*  but he doesn't mean to. He embraces BDS, but he doesn't mean to. He's a full-scale anti-Semite, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=157.36s)]
*  but he denies it. We're going to get into him, trust me on this, because if he gets elected, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=165.44s)]
*  you can say goodbye to New York City, the greatest city in America. It is. I'm a [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=170.0s)]
*  Philadelphian, but we know what's what. So we have to fight this. Can you imagine all the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=174.24s)]
*  good people leaving New York? And then the certain people who flock into New York, again, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=181.52s)]
*  I'm not talking about Muslims, I'm talking about radical Islamists, like the kinds you've seen at [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=187.28s)]
*  Columbia and NYU and all the rest of it. The media will say, well, that's bigoted. That's not bigoted. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=191.44s)]
*  I didn't attack Muslims, I attacked the Islamists, but we don't really give a damn [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=198.72s)]
*  what the left thinks. They're destroying our country. But here's the deal, folks. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=204.32s)]
*  I've been behind this microphone almost 25 years. Then I learned from the greatest, Rush Limbaugh. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  He was a close, close friend of mine, as is my brother, Sean Hannity. And there are other great [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=214.95999999999998s)]
*  people in this business, too. But I've told you many times, Rush Limbaugh always said, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=221.52s)]
*  respect your audience. He loved his audience. You, my wonderful audience. He loved you, as I do. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=228.72s)]
*  But it's important that some policing goes on, that there's some integrity in people [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=238.4s)]
*  who come to conservatives, hardworking men and women, middle class, blue collar, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=244.4s)]
*  who come to them and lie to them. Lie to you, my people, and my audience. Lie to Russia's old [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=255.44s)]
*  audience or Hannity's audience. Lie to Republicans and conservatives and MAGA. Just lie. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=263.12s)]
*  They conceal who they are. They deceive who they are. I've spent weeks now exposing [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=270.16s)]
*  Chatsworth Katarelson. He's a snake. He's a fraud. He's a phony. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=277.92s)]
*  I have not spent enough time on a true fraudster, Steve Bannon. He's a con man. He's a con artist. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=286.24s)]
*  You need to know about this man. The media loves him. Why? Because he's a leaker. He [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=296.24s)]
*  leaked against President Trump. He leaked against his family when he was at the White House. One [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=301.68s)]
*  of the reasons they kicked his considerable ass out of there is because he's a leaker. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=305.68s)]
*  They leaked to the left-wing media, as Katarelson did and does. That was exposed. Katarelson, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=309.52s)]
*  as article after article, text after text, smearing Donald Trump. Not just policy, no, just [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=315.6s)]
*  attacking him as a human being. Bannon has done the same thing. It all came to a head now when [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  the president decided, I've got to take out these nuclear sites in Iran. Because you see, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=330.64s)]
*  these guys are invested in with newsletters and platforms and God knows what. They're grifters. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=337.12s)]
*  That's the bottom line. Like Rush used to say, follow the money. Defending Qatar, defending Iran, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=342.96s)]
*  Qatar, defending Iran. I don't even think they're really isolationists. I think they embrace our [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=350.96s)]
*  enemies, that they're thoroughly un-American. What explains their conduct? They accused Trump of [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=357.2s)]
*  starting World War III or going to start World War III in complicity, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=367.84s)]
*  in the lead-up to a military operation against the enemy. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=372.32s)]
*  That's not what red-blooded Americans think. That's not what patriotic Americans think. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=376.48s)]
*  Now, I want you to listen to this. You draw your own conclusion. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=385.44s)]
*  The rap. Steve Bannon pleads guilty and schemed to steal $15 million from border wall donors. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=391.76s)]
*  That's you. You. You were the mark. Steve Bannon, long-time Trump ally and former chief strategist, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=398.79999999999995s)]
*  avoided jail time by pleading guilty Tuesday. This is February 2025. This is a few months ago. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=404.4s)]
*  To defrauding donors who thought their money was being used to help build a wall at the [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=411.52s)]
*  southern border of the United States. You were the target. Bannon was shot dead by a gun. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=415.44s)]
*  You were the target. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=423.52s)]
*  Bannon was charged with five felony counts and faced up to 15 years in prison. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=427.84s)]
*  The guilty plea filed in New York criminal court allows Bannon to avoid jail time as [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=432.15999999999997s)]
*  long as he does not commit any more crimes. Wow. And the plea comes with a three-year [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=436.64s)]
*  conditional discharge and waives his right to appeal. Bannon is not required to pay restitution. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=444.08s)]
*  He was indicted in 2022 on state charges, including money laundering, conspiracy, and fraud [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=448.88s)]
*  after creating an online fundraising campaign titled We Build the Wall. The donations were [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=457.44s)]
*  promoted to be used to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. According to reports, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=462.56s)]
*  Bannon and his partners raised over $15 million. I'm just reading the news. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=466.71999999999997s)]
*  I started looking at this. It was unbelievable. This is not, this is the least of it. There's more. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=474.08s)]
*  This was not the first time Bannon was charged with a defrauding scheme. He was charged in 2020 [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=479.52s)]
*  by federal prosecutors in a different case. However, he was pardoned by Donald Trump during [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=484.71999999999997s)]
*  the final hours of his first term. The same Donald Trump who he stabs in the back. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=489.44s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=498.8s)]
*  Now, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=499.6s)]
*  Politico. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=503.6s)]
*  Bannon ally Chinese billionaire arrested on fraud charges. How many of you know Chinese [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=507.36s)]
*  billionaires who are arrested on fraud charges? This guy presents himself as the everyday American. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=511.76000000000005s)]
*  Federal prosecutors in New York arrested exiled Chinese billionaire and Steve Bannon ally [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=518.64s)]
*  Wingu on charges that he and his financier orchestrated a more than $1 billion fraud scheme [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=524.4s)]
*  aimed at Gao's hundreds of thousands of online followers. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=530.3199999999999s)]
*  Gao also goes by the name of Miles Kwok and his financier [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=535.04s)]
*  were charged in a 12-count indictment with wire fraud, securities fraud, bank fraud, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=541.04s)]
*  money laundering, and it goes on. In 2020, Bannon was charged with $1.5 billion fraud scheme. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=545.6s)]
*  Bannon was arrested on federal fraud charges while abroad while aboard the guy's yacht. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=554.56s)]
*  Bannon pleaded not guilty was subsequently pardoned on those charges by former president [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=560.3199999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump. I don't know all the ins and outs of this. The article goes on and on and on, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=564.48s)]
*  but he needed a pardon. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=568.8s)]
*  So let's just let's just sum this up. Guy gets a pardon on federal charges. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=573.6s)]
*  The guy pleads guilty to state charges [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=578.0799999999999s)]
*  of ripping off average Americans who think they're donating for a wall. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=580.16s)]
*  Pretty heavy, don't you think? And here's the New York Post. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=592.8s)]
*  2021 Trump pardons former White House strategist Steve Bannon, President Trump [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=598.88s)]
*  on Tuesday night pardon former campaign aide and White House strategist. And of course, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=603.68s)]
*  Trump fired him from the White House because he wouldn't stop leaking leaking on his [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=608.8s)]
*  co-workers, apparently like Jared Kushner. And then some guy writes a book, I think his name was [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=613.28s)]
*  Wolf, and he basically accuses Don Jr. of treason. And that was it for Trump. He kicked his fat ass [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=619.52s)]
*  out of the White House. Now, this guy, by the way, has called for the investigation and deportation [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=625.04s)]
*  of Elon Musk. He's called for the investigation of Kayleigh McEnany, Sean Hannity, the Murdochs, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=633.68s)]
*  and me, meaning he wants us prosecuted and thrown in prison because we support Israel. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=640.88s)]
*  This guy said today that Israel is not our ally, that we should drop Israel. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=646.8s)]
*  So like Qatar, Olson, they side with the enemy. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=651.5999999999999s)]
*  And they're incessant leakers like Qatar, Olson. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=657.1999999999999s)]
*  They condemn the left wing media. They are the left wing media. They work with the left wing media. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=659.92s)]
*  It says here, New York Post, Bannon was accused of scamming $1 million from donors to the We [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=668.7199999999999s)]
*  Build the Wall GoFundMe campaign launched by US Air Force veteran Brian Colfage, who lost three limbs. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=674.16s)]
*  It's horrible. Horrible. There seems to be no line this guy won't cross. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=682.16s)]
*  But this scam was obviously aimed at you. He was busted in August aboard the Lady May, a $28 million yacht [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=687.6s)]
*  owned by a Chinese billionaire. I mentioned it before. Bannon's pardon was among a wave of last-minute [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=694.64s)]
*  clemencies the White House was expected to announce ahead of the Biden inauguration. Well, he got it. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=699.9200000000001s)]
*  He got it. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=707.28s)]
*  It goes on. There's many more details here. We're not going to spend all day on this. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=711.28s)]
*  We're not going to spend all day on this, but I feel I have a public service responsibility [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=716.16s)]
*  as a Trump supporter, as a MAGA supporter, as a conservative, as a radio host who has [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=720.8s)]
*  spent decades trying to build this movement. You know, Bill Buckley through the John Birch Society [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=726.8s)]
*  out of the conservative movement. These people are not MAGA. They are fake MAGA. They have [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=735.6s)]
*  latched onto this. They're grifters. That's what they are. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=740.08s)]
*  I know you've heard of them. I know you thought they're no good. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=745.76s)]
*  Now they can come back with all the names and smears and I'm a Jew and, you know, Tel Aviv and [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=751.4399999999999s)]
*  all that. I don't mind Tel Aviv, Mark. Because I don't hate Israel. But here's the thing, Bannon, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=756.64s)]
*  you're always going to be a fraud for the rest of your life. That's your legacy. You're a crook. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=766.88s)]
*  You confess to it. They keep your fat ass out of prison. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=772.08s)]
*  That's what you did. I've never been on a boat with a Chinese billionaire who's charged with [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=781.04s)]
*  crimes either. I've never needed a pardon from President Trump either. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=786.4s)]
*  There was a great piece written, wish I'd known about it earlier, in the Hill. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=795.12s)]
*  By somebody named John McGillian. Steve Bannon wants you to believe he's a ward general for the [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=802.72s)]
*  forgotten man, a blue collar, profiting in cargo pants, ready to torch the global elites on behalf [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=809.4399999999999s)]
*  of truckers and farmers. But strip away the flannel and fury and what you'll find isn't a populace. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=814.96s)]
*  It's a financier, a Hollywood operator, a man worth $20 million. LARPing as a cold, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=820.8s)]
*  dusted crusader for the common man. This is the hustle. Bannon talks like a patriot but lives like [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=830.08s)]
*  a prince. He rails against the globalists while building his own global network. He warns you [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=835.44s)]
*  about the machine even as he becomes a vital gear in it. Let's rewind. Before Breitbart, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=840.72s)]
*  before the war room podcast, which should be called the fraud room, before the MAGA movement [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=846.32s)]
*  and talk of deconstructing the administrative state, Bannon was something far less revolutionary, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=851.2800000000001s)]
*  a banker. And not just any banker. He was a high powered executive at Goldman Sachs, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=856.64s)]
*  the very temple of global finance he now pretends to rage against. He didn't walk picket lines. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=861.6s)]
*  He walked into boardrooms. He advised mergers and helped move capital around like puzzle pieces in [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=866.96s)]
*  the portfolios of the powerful. He got in on the deals most Americans would never even hear about, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=872.72s)]
*  let alone benefit from. One of those deals, Seinfeld. After leaving Goldman, he began his [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=877.68s)]
*  own firm and worked with Westinghouse to successfully acquire a minority stake in [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=882.88s)]
*  Castle Rock Entertainment, the producer of Seinfeld. As part of that deal, Bannon accepted a stake in [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=887.28s)]
*  the royalties of their show. Holy mackerel. So why do you have to defraud people? Isn't that enough? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=892.88s)]
*  Translation. Every time you left at Kramer's entrance, Bannon got richer. While working class [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=901.4399999999999s)]
*  Americans were juggling bills and wondering if they can afford another tank of gas, Bannon was [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=906.64s)]
*  cashing passive income from a sitcom about nothing. And when that well started to run dry, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=910.72s)]
*  he pivoted to image. He went Hollywood. He did not go as a writer or director, but as a producer, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=916.64s)]
*  the shadowy figure behind the scenes, raising money, shaping narratives, angling for influence. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=922.72s)]
*  He produced a slate of forgettable documentaries with big ambitions and a little reach, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=927.84s)]
*  hoping to strike gold or at least strike a nerve. He sniffed around the Vanity Fair circuit, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=933.0400000000001s)]
*  elbowed his way through the fringes of Los Angeles power lunch culture, tried to matter in [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=937.76s)]
*  rooms where creative types mingled with capital, but it didn't stick. He was too blunt, too [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=942.3199999999999s)]
*  ideological, too out of place. So he rebranded. When the red carpet didn't welcome, he found an [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=946.96s)]
*  alternative stage. He embraced Carhartt cosplay, grew out the hair, declared himself a champion of [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=955.92s)]
*  the people, but make no mistake, he never stopped living like royalty. His personal life was padded [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=962.32s)]
*  by old Goldman money. The bank account never left Bel Air. The Rolex never came off. He wasn't just [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=967.84s)]
*  out of touch with the working class. He was orbiting them from space, occasionally parachuting [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=973.7600000000001s)]
*  down to give a speech about sovereignty and struggle, then retreating back to his fortified [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=979.36s)]
*  compound of fine scotch. Deceit and duplicity aren't bugs in Bannon's matrix. They're part of [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=983.6800000000001s)]
*  the operating system. I'm going to take a break and finish the article and then we're going to move [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=990.16s)]

*  undermining President Trump's administration left and right. I'll be right back. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1006.88s)]

*  crisis, reverse the effects of Biden inflation and restore American greatness. But since January 20, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1024.72s)]
*  judges across our country have consistently been blocking President Trump's attempts to [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1030.48s)]

*  they're utterly uncommon. They view you as a mark, as targets. They're demagogues, they're [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1093.28s)]

*  work hard about what, what's going on here. You know, this guy, Katarlson, among other things, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1232.64s)]
*  he's a trust fund baby with the Swanson frozen food family. I don't hold that against him. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1237.52s)]
*  I really don't, but you ought to stop pretending he's a common man, a blue collar guy when he was [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1243.8400000000001s)]
*  born with a silver, no, platinum spoon in his mouth. And same with Fatboy here, the Rosie O'Donnell [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1249.84s)]
*  lookalike. And so this gentleman writes, Jack McGillian, a writer and researcher who explores [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1257.68s)]
*  culture, society, and the impact of technology on daily life, at the wrap, take the infamous [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1266.4s)]
*  build the wall scheme, for example, Bannon raised millions of dollars from ordinary Americans, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1273.44s)]
*  promising every penny would go to the wall. Trump couldn't finish, he said. And what, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1277.44s)]
*  and what happened? The money vanished into private pockets, luxury expenses, personal salaries. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1282.0800000000002s)]
*  Bannon was arrested on a Chinese billionaire yacht, lounging in luxury while federal agents [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1287.3600000000001s)]
*  boarded. He was spared only by a last minute Trump pardon. It somehow that only added to his legend. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1292.96s)]
*  Then came the super group pitch, a global nationalist alliance, a global nationalist alliance, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1299.68s)]
*  conferences in Hungary, meetings in Rome, and whispered influence over several European populists. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1306.56s)]
*  Bannon wasn't interested in saving mainstream, he was franchising the culture war, exporting [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1312.8s)]
*  MAGA aesthetics to every corner of the globe, not because he believed in the cause, but because [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1317.6799999999998s)]
*  there's always a market for outrage. This is not the story of a man who joined the people. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1322.08s)]
*  It's the story of a man who studied them, branded them, and built a media empire on their backs. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1327.2s)]
*  He frames everything as a spiritual battle, America versus the elites, but Bannon is the elite. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1332.8799999999999s)]
*  He just speaks rage fluently. So here's the question. If a man tells you he's at war with [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1338.48s)]
*  the empire while still cashing royalty checks from it, do you believe him? Or do you finally see it [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1343.52s)]
*  for what it is? Ask the writer. Bannon is not a warrior for the working man. He's a salesman in [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1348.6399999999999s)]
*  battle gear with a podcast mic and a passport full of donor meetings. He doesn't live among the people, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1356.0s)]
*  he studies them, scripts their anger, sells it back to them. He rebranded himself so many times, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1362.16s)]
*  this reminds me of Nick Katarlson rebranding himself so many times. He's rebranded himself [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1367.8400000000001s)]

*  persona, carefully tailored to meet the moment, each pivot engineered for maximum leverage. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1383.68s)]
*  The flannel, the Catholic mysticism, the bunker aesthetic, it's all part of the shameless act. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1389.3600000000001s)]

*  but to inhabit. Part P.D. Barnum, part Papua canon. This is a man who preaches humility while flying [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1401.0400000000002s)]
*  private. Steve Bannon isn't leading a rebellion, he is selling one. You can look all this stuff up [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1407.92s)]

*  do. They interview each other. They promote each other. They write about each other because they [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1471.92s)]
*  have to protect what they have. Ninety four percent of Republican MAGA supported what Donald Trump [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1476.72s)]
*  did. Not one of these guys did. Not one. They warned you about World War Three. They warned you [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1482.72s)]
*  about the Jews dragging us into another war. They warned you about the price of fuel going to thirty [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1490.24s)]
*  dollars a gallon when it actually fell. Everything they said, all their fear mongering proven wrong. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1498.0s)]
*  And you know what? I hate to say this. They're sitting on the edge of their chairs. If something [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1504.56s)]
*  happens, they want to attack Trump and me and the people who spoke out. And basically what they're [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1508.88s)]
*  attacking is the United States military. The United States military, which they trash all the time, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1515.6s)]
*  all the time. Here's the deal. The good guys won. Our armed forces won. Our great commander in chief, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1525.6s)]
*  brilliant, won. Our great allies, the Israelis, our great friend, Prime Minister Netanyahu, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1537.36s)]
*  they won. The allies won. You won. We won. The truth has been exposed. These guys have been exposed. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1544.32s)]
*  All of them. It's out there to read. You can read it or not. These are facts. Facts. Read it or not. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1554.32s)]
*  Don't worry about the names they used. Sloganeers, isolationists are sloganeers. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1566.8s)]
*  That's what they're. Marxists are sloganeers. Islamists are sloganeers. White supremacists [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1574.0s)]
*  are sloganeers. The Black Panthers are sloganeers. That's the genre in which these guys swim. It's the [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1578.1599999999999s)]
*  sewer. And I regret having to go into the sewer to deal with these guys, but that's where they are. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1585.28s)]
*  They're sewer rats. And you got to go into the sewer to deal with them. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1591.52s)]
*  The problem is I can climb out. They can't. That's their habitat. That's what they do. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1596.4s)]
*  They're not MAGA. They're not Reagan conservatives. They're not Trump conservatives. They're not [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1608.16s)]
*  patriots. They're a disgrace. No, the president isn't complicit in starting World War III, you [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1614.56s)]
*  jackass Katarsyn. No, the president didn't turn his back on MAGA. Fat boy, you fraudster. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1625.84s)]
*  And I can go right down the list. These are the little niches they've carved out for themselves. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1632.56s)]
*  So celebrate what we did to a tyrannical regime that has killed thousands and [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1638.96s)]
*  maimed thousands of Americans. Celebrate it. Not one, not one of our military was harmed. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1645.6000000000001s)]
*  Not one of our bombers was touched. Celebrate it. We won. We won. Isn't that good? [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1652.0s)]
*  It's great. And remember who was rooting for the enemy. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1662.88s)]
*  Remember who was rooting for the enemy. They were. That's not America first. That is disgusting. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1671.2s)]
*  I want to read one other thing to you about our great president. And he is great. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1681.8400000000001s)]
*  Doesn't mean you always have to agree with him, but you should never sabotage him and stab him [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1687.6000000000001s)]
*  in the back and call him the things that Katarsyn has called him done to him. What [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1691.76s)]
*  Bannon did to him when he took him into his confidence and brought him into the White House [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1697.52s)]
*  that he's leaking left and right. Pardon the fat ass and even up to this point, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1700.96s)]
*  stabs him in the back in the lead up to war. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1706.48s)]
*  Donald Trump just posted this breaking news. I was shocked to hear that the state of Israel, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1712.4s)]
*  which has just had one of its greatest moments in history and is strongly led by Bibi Netanyahu, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1718.96s)]
*  is continuing its ridiculous witch hunt against their great wartime prime minister Bibi. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1725.04s)]
*  And I just went through hell together fighting a very tough and brilliant long time enemy of Israel, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1731.36s)]
*  Iran. And Bibi could not have been better, sharper or stronger in his love for the incredible [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1737.52s)]
*  Holy Land. Anybody else would have suffered losses, embarrassment and chaos. Bibi Netanyahu was a [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1744.32s)]
*  warrior like perhaps no other warrior in the history of Israel. And the result was something [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1751.04s)]
*  that nobody thought that nobody thought fought harder or more competently than Bibi Netanyahu. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1756.6399999999999s)]
*  Despite all of this, I just learned that Bibi has been summoned to court on Monday for the [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1763.84s)]
*  continuation of his long running. He has been going through this horror show since May 2020, [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1770.16s)]
*  unheard of. This is the first time a sitting Israeli prime minister has ever been on trial. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1775.6000000000001s)]
*  This long running politically motivated case concerning cigars, a bug's bunny doll, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1781.92s)]
*  and numerous other unfair charges in order to do him great harm. Such a witch hunt for a man who [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1788.5600000000002s)]
*  has given so much is unthinkable to me. He deserves much better than this. And so does the [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1795.44s)]
*  state of Israel. Bibi Netanyahu's trial should be canceled immediately or a pardon given to a great [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1801.8400000000001s)]
*  hero who has done so much for the state. Perhaps there is no one that I know who could have worked [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1808.48s)]
*  in better harmony with the president of the United States, me, than Bibi Netanyahu. It was the United [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1815.04s)]
*  States of America that saved Israel, and now it's going to be the United States of America that [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1821.04s)]
*  saves Bibi Netanyahu. This travesty of justice cannot be allowed. Capital's exclamation mark. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1825.44s)]
*  You know what Bannon said today? He trashed Netanyahu, said he was trying to drag us into a war, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1832.56s)]
*  that we should drop Israel, that Israel's not our ally. Does that sound right to you, America? [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1838.32s)]
*  These bigoted pigs are disgusting. They don't represent you and me. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1847.36s)]
*  When I was a young man, I admired Ronald Reagan. And we fought like hell to get him the nomination, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1851.04s)]
*  and they tried to block him repeatedly. And over Donald Trump's left shoulder in the Oval Office is [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1862.0s)]
*  the official portrait of Ronald Reagan. He's a great admirer of Ronald Reagan, as I've come to learn. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1872.32s)]
*  As I've come to learn. And I will tell you one other thing, and then we'll move on. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1879.36s)]
*  When I met with President Trump on June 4th, I wasn't seeking a pardon. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1887.6799999999998s)]
*  I didn't have to apologize for anything. He asked me to come meet with him. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1897.44s)]
*  He asked me weeks before to come to dinner with my wife and him. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1902.56s)]
*  I couldn't make it work because I want to stay on radio, TV, and do what I need to do. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1907.52s)]
*  I told him I have to go to Florida. I go to Florida for several reasons, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1915.6799999999998s)]
*  one of which is I have a very ailing older brother. I told him I can't. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1922.24s)]
*  He said, well, look, Mark, as soon as you get back, contact me first. I want to get you in here. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1928.3200000000002s)]
*  That's how that meeting occurred. I'm not going to get into the specifics. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1936.8s)]
*  He was very inquisitive. He inquired of my views. And let me just put it this way. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1942.0800000000002s)]
*  Everything you hear me say, everything, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1947.76s)]
*  everything you hear me say, everything, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1951.9199999999998s)]
*  I'm consistent in private and public. I said to the Mr. President, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1958.6399999999999s)]
*  I'm being accused of leading a lobbying campaign of warmongers. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1963.76s)]
*  And he laughed because he knows it's a lie. He said, Mark, if I want to know what your views are, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1969.36s)]
*  you know what I do. I said, what, sir? I watch your Fox TV shows. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1976.8799999999999s)]
*  Ninety-nine percent of what I know about your views I watch on television with everybody else. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1982.48s)]
*  You see, folks, the man has integrity. I like to think I have integrity. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1992.3999999999999s)]
*  The people I've been talking to you about have no integrity. They're operators. They're looking for [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=1998.8799999999999s)]
*  an angle. You'll notice at the inauguration, my wife and I, and he loves my wife even more than me. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2003.76s)]
*  And he loves her because she's a great patriot. And she came to his defense [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2017.12s)]
*  and brought two serious matters in front of the Supreme Court. Not the other arguments, real [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2023.12s)]
*  matters involving the authority of states and the authority of states in federal elections. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2028.72s)]
*  The court almost took it, took a look at both those cases, but apparently they couldn't get [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2034.32s)]
*  four justices. Word is they got three. And he always thanked her for that. All these people say, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2038.72s)]
*  Mark, never a Trump or a... One day, because of Roger Stone, who I've come to like, I don't know [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2045.44s)]
*  him, but I like the guy. He's a fighter. I've been wrong about him. I think he's been wrong about me. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2052.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter. When that swatch heap showed up at his house, it changed everything for me. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2059.36s)]
*  Nobody should be treated like that. And I said, he said something, I said, I don't remember what I [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2065.04s)]
*  did. I said, you know what, from here forward, I'm a never a Trump. And I've explained this story [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2071.76s)]
*  many times, but it doesn't seem to matter. Donald Trump picked up the phone and he said, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2074.96s)]
*  I said, Roger's a dear friend, but he doesn't speak for me. Not in this. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2078.24s)]
*  And I went on the air and I explained that call. Did I not, Mr. Producer? [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2084.24s)]
*  That's my great never Trump-er. I fought harder in defense of Donald Trump [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2089.6s)]
*  when he's been under attack, criminally and civilly in five different jurisdictions. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2096.16s)]
*  And he will be attacked again. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2102.24s)]
*  And I will be loyal to him because he loves this country. He's done so much good for this country. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2103.52s)]
*  Look what he's done to Iran that no other president would do or could do. And I will defend [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2112.16s)]
*  him, including against Carlson, Bannon, Gates, Green with an E, and the rest of these bastards. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2118.48s)]
*  I'll be right back. President Trump is in Washington with a mandate from the American [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2133.28s)]
*  people to solve the border crisis, reverse the effects of Biden inflation and restore [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2145.28s)]
*  American greatness. But since January 20 judges across our country have consistently been blocking [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2149.6800000000003s)]

*  I've informed millions and millions of you [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2227.12s)]

*  You'll notice when president Trump says peace through strength, that's Reagan too. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2239.04s)]
*  When he talks about make America great again, that's Reagan too. I'm Reagan and Trump. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2243.2s)]

*  mayor of New York City and why it is a national, a national concern, grave concern. And no, media, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2278.56s)]
*  not because he's Muslim. It's because he's an Islamist who hates America and hates Jews. You [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2286.96s)]
*  know, media, you've been giving an awful lot of support to people like that. You're highly [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2293.9199999999996s)]
*  contemptible and disgusting. The Hamas media, the Al Jazeera media. No, you don't get to call us [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2299.04s)]
*  names. We call you names. I'll be right back. This segment of the podcast is exclusively [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2306.08s)]

*  Now broadcasting from the underground command post, deep in the bowels of a hidden bunker, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2333.84s)]
*  somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building, we once again make contact [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2339.7599999999998s)]
*  with our leader, Mark Levin. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2345.44s)]
*  Hello America. Mark Levin here. Our number 877-381-3811. 877-31. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2352.32s)]
*  381. We have a great guest on our three, our buddy Byron Donalds. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2363.2000000000003s)]
*  Now in the context of talking about these, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2370.32s)]
*  this America-hating, Jew-hating Islamist who's getting the Democrat Party nomination for Mayor [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2373.44s)]
*  of New York City, which has the largest [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2379.6s)]
*  concentration of Jews on the face of the earth. Think about that. And we'll get into where he [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2383.76s)]
*  stands and what he really is. Just know this. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2388.2400000000002s)]
*  Global, what is it? Global, what? Intifada, excuse me. Global Intifada. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2393.36s)]
*  Intifada is a war, terrorist, terrorism war against the Jews. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2403.44s)]
*  He said he has supported it. He said it was recently 2023. And the other day he said, [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2409.52s)]
*  look, that's just a rallying cry. It doesn't really mean anything. It means a lot. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2413.92s)]
*  Intifada 1, Intifada 2 resulted in the murder of hundreds and hundreds of Jews, [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2418.48s)]
*  blowing up school buses, blowing up pizza parlors in Israel. And this guy blows it off. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2425.12s)]
*  As a student, he led the chapter, he created the chapter and then led it of Students for Justice [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2432.64s)]
*  in Palestine, which as you know is a Hamas front group. He's campaigned for BDS, which is [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2438.8s)]
*  a war on Israel's economy, trying to persuade countries, institutions, our states, colleges [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2449.68s)]
*  and universities, other businesses to cut off all commercial dealings, financial dealings with [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2457.44s)]
*  the state of Israel to bankrupt it. This is the guy who wants to be mayor. But before we get into [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2464.64s)]
*  that, I want to lay the context for this. This is very, very important. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2470.96s)]
*  As I've said here many times, and as I've written many times, Marxism and Americanism are [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2480.64s)]
*  incompatible. What I've also said here many times, and I've written, is that Islamism [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2487.12s)]
*  and Americanism are incompatible. Now, what do I mean by that? Is that because I hate Muslims? [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2495.7599999999998s)]
*  It has nothing to do with that. Nothing whatsoever. But you've got to be able to speak the truth. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2504.72s)]
*  You've got to be able to speak the truth, whether it's Carlson or Bannon or the rest of it. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2513.2s)]
*  And you've got to be able to speak the truth about this. This is life and death stuff. As an example, [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2517.8399999999997s)]
*  the regime that runs Iran is not going to stop. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2526.7999999999997s)]
*  And there's only so much a president can do in his term. We took out their nukes. The Prime Minister [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2530.96s)]
*  defeated them militarily. But they're not going to stop. Why? Because [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2536.16s)]
*  they are zealots. They are fanatics. They're throwbacks to the seventh century. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2547.6s)]
*  Let me explain. First, let's talk about ourselves. I think this is important. This is a little [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2555.3599999999997s)]
*  cerebral, and that's important. I like to get back to cerebral. We're going to get out of the [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2560.96s)]
*  sewer now. We're going to talk, Mark talk. You and I, we believe God is the sovereign. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2566.16s)]
*  I don't care if you're an atheist or an agnostic. You don't have to believe that. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2575.12s)]
*  But you benefit from it. And I'll explain that in a minute, too. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2578.8799999999997s)]
*  The people in this country benefit from the Judeo-Christian belief system, whether they are [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2583.92s)]
*  Jewish or Christian or not. You don't have to be a Jew. You don't have to be a Christian. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2589.12s)]
*  But you benefit from the Judeo-Christian value belief principle system. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2596.7999999999997s)]
*  You also benefit from the Enlightenment. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2608.7999999999997s)]
*  From the Enlightenment. Now, this is all in my new book, by the way, On Power. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2613.52s)]
*  In one section of it. It's not the whole thing. But I want you to hear me out, [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2619.2799999999997s)]
*  because this affects what's going on right now in New York and the whole country and Iran and all [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2624.0s)]
*  the rest of it. We believe God is the sovereign. Read your Declaration of Independence. You don't [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2628.3199999999997s)]
*  even have to open the Bible. Read your Declaration of Independence. Natural law, natural rights, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2636.4s)]
*  unalienable rights, universal truth. Where does all that come from? It doesn't come from man. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2643.84s)]
*  Your founders in 1776 issued a Declaration of Independence, in essence, a declaration of war [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2653.68s)]
*  against the most powerful military on the face of the earth, the British. And they wanted to make it [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2661.04s)]
*  clear to the whole world why, why they are going to fight the most powerful military on the face [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2666.0s)]
*  of the earth. It was almost a forever war, you know, it went on for seven years, eight years. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2673.76s)]
*  But that aside. And what did they cite, among other things? The core of it was, [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2680.4s)]
*  we have unalienable rights. We have the right to be free. We have the right to [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2689.28s)]
*  representative government. There's natural law, natural, natural rights, [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2694.56s)]
*  unalienable rights that no man, no government can give or take. The sovereign does. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2702.96s)]
*  Okay, you with me right now? Now look, people can preach religion a hell of a lot better than I can. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2710.64s)]
*  I'm not preaching religion. I'm preaching your history. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2718.16s)]
*  Whether you like it or not, and most of you do, [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2720.48s)]
*  God is the sovereign. That's what the people who wrote the declaration believe. That's what the [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2728.16s)]
*  people who fought for your freedom in your country believed. Hence, God's children, [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2733.92s)]
*  when mere mortals are making a government, God's children are the sovereign. The children of God, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2742.56s)]
*  who he created, are the sovereign. Because he says so. You're the sovereign. Not a man-made [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2747.76s)]
*  government, not a polar bureau, not a dictator. You're the sovereign. Okay? [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2758.48s)]
*  Now what did the founders do? Well, we know they believed in that. That's the declaration. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2770.32s)]
*  And then they write this constitution, right? Stick with me. I'm going to be doing this all [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2777.36s)]
*  hour. It's very, very important. And again, it's all in my book On Power. If you like what I'm [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2782.4s)]
*  talking about, you find it intriguing and compelling, get the book because it's explained in [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2786.4s)]
*  much more detail in a book. But let me continue. This is just part of the book. And it relates to [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2790.88s)]
*  everything, including this frigging nominee. Stick with me. The constitution. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2795.92s)]
*  Where did they get this stuff about representative government? Now that's not in the Bible. That's [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2806.8799999999997s)]
*  not in the Torah. Consensual government. Where does that come from? They have the divide power, [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2812.72s)]
*  separation of powers, that you can't have an overbearing centralized government that [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2819.68s)]
*  lords over you. Where did they get this stuff from? The enlightenment. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2826.3999999999996s)]
*  From John Locke, from Montesquieu and others. Originally Aristotle, among the Romans, Cicero, [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2830.24s)]
*  many. But your framers of the constitution were focused on Locke and Montesquieu. Montesquieu's [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2840.72s)]
*  mentioned multiple times in the Federalist paper. Now, how do we know they relied on all of this? [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2848.0s)]
*  Because they tell us. I include the letter. Thomas Jefferson was asked. He was accused. He said, [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2853.6s)]
*  You didn't come up with all these ideas, Jefferson. What makes you so great? You didn't come up with [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2862.96s)]
*  all these ideas. In effect, that's what the guy wrote him. And he wrote back. I never said I did. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2867.36s)]
*  I use the accumulated agreed upon knowledge that existed in our country. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2875.12s)]
*  And of course, the declaration speaks of this God seven times. The creator, providence, so forth. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2884.16s)]
*  And then he cites Aristotle and Cicero and Locke [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2894.56s)]
*  and Montesquieu and others and others. He tells us that's what he relied on when he made the [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2900.56s)]
*  first draft of the declaration. That's what they embraced, all of them. So what does that tell you? [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2906.64s)]
*  As I explained in my book, America was founded with a fusion of Judeo-Christian values and the [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2912.88s)]
*  enlightenment. Judeo-Christian values and the enlightenment. Now, let's turn to Marxism. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2921.6800000000003s)]
*  Well, they don't believe in any religious values or faith values. They believe in the [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2932.1600000000003s)]
*  elimination of faith. They believe the state is the demigod. They believe the state gives rights, [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2935.44s)]
*  takes rights, gives freedom, take freedom for the people. Of course, the people make all these [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2942.4s)]
*  decisions. And we know that's a lie, don't we? People make no decisions. There's no democratic [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2947.2000000000003s)]
*  aspect to it whatsoever. But the proletariat will rise up, destroy the bourgeoisie, destroy the [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2951.6s)]
*  existing vestiges of any prior society, the chains of prior societies, the feudal systems, [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2959.6s)]
*  agrarian systems, all systems, capitalism. The word capitalism was first written by Marx. Marx. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2966.4s)]
*  We must destroy what exists, even the family relationship, the nuclear family. It must all [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2977.76s)]
*  be destroyed. Faith is nothing more than mysticism, and it stands in the way of progress and [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2983.76s)]
*  modernity and all the rest. That's in the book, too, just explaining it. That's Marxism. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2990.0s)]
*  And the paradise will be the worker's paradise. Isn't it funny how they always predict what's [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=2997.84s)]
*  going to be the end result? You can't predict any end result when you're talking about human [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3002.8s)]
*  behavior. There's so many fallacies in Marxism, and I touch on a number of them in the book. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3006.72s)]
*  But I don't want to talk about Marxism. I want to talk about Islamism. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3011.28s)]
*  Now, what does Islamism have in common with Marxism? Why is it that Islamists and Marxists [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3015.44s)]
*  are often the same? Are they marched together in Colombia or UCLA or Harvard or whatever? [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3022.96s)]
*  Why is it that the Marxists like Bernie Sanders and the Islamists like Tlaib, [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3028.88s)]
*  the Marxists like AOC and the Islamists like Omar and down the list, why is it that they [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3034.56s)]
*  form such a tight, tight alliance? Because of the means that justify the ends. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3041.04s)]
*  What do the Islamists want? They tell us what they want. I don't have to imply anything. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3052.72s)]
*  Just because they don't read it in the New York Times or they read it and they don't care, [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3059.92s)]
*  it's irrelevant to me. The Islamists want the same thing the Marxists want, the absolute [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3064.24s)]
*  destruction of the West, the absolute destruction of Judaism and Christianity and Judeo-Christian [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3070.72s)]
*  values. That's what Islamists want. That's why they march together. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3077.12s)]
*  Now you'll say, well, the Islamists, they believe in God. The Marxists don't. It doesn't matter. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3086.3199999999997s)]

*  Then they fight among themselves and decide it's almost like Trotsky and and Stalin, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3097.84s)]
*  two communists who fight and decide, no, this is the way we rule. No, this is the way that we rule. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3103.36s)]
*  Not an exact parallel, but good enough. The Islamists and the Marxists at some point, [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3107.6800000000003s)]
*  God forbid if we don't exist anymore. And by the way, it's not just Jews and Christians. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3114.7200000000003s)]
*  It's Muslims who don't believe what they believe. It's Hindus, it's Buddhists, it's atheists, [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3119.36s)]

*  It's the only way that we can reach our God is destroy all this other stuff that's in between. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3144.2400000000002s)]

*  That's why the regime in Iran, unless it is completely obliterated, is not going away. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3156.96s)]
*  And neither are their nuclear ambitions. That's different from saying Trump should do it, [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3163.44s)]
*  the Israelis should do it, the world should do it. I'm not getting into that right now. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3169.28s)]
*  I'm talking about the mindset. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3172.48s)]
*  And so of course, Islamists are the enemy. They're our enemy. They're the enemy [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3178.2400000000002s)]
*  of Americanism. They're the enemy of the West. That's what they are. That's why they say death [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3183.68s)]
*  to America, death to Israel. What they mean is death to everybody who disagrees with us, everybody. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3191.44s)]
*  And now one of them is the Democrat nominee [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3197.28s)]
*  for mayor of New York. Does that mean he's a terrorist and wants to kill everybody? No, of course not. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3202.0s)]
*  In order to westernize the revolution, and we know this from among other things, [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3211.6800000000003s)]
*  the 1993 bugging of a hotel room at the Marriott outside the Philadelphia International Airport, [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3217.1200000000003s)]

*  other things, it's available, a lot of it for you on the internet, for the New York Times, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3228.2400000000002s)]
*  if you want to take a look. And by the way, as a footnote, to call Charlie Kirk a racist makes me [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3231.84s)]
*  sick to my stomach. He and I don't always agree, but he's earnest, okay? He's not a racist. He's [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3238.2400000000002s)]
*  not an anti-racist. He's not a racist. He's not a racist. He's not a racist. He's not a racist. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3245.36s)]

*  That's my two cents. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3260.32s)]
*  And so what they decided to do is sort of Americanize themselves, get people elected to Congress, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3264.0s)]
*  get people in the media, create care, which would claim to be the greatest civil rights, [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3269.2s)]
*  Muslim civil rights organization in America, where they push the agenda [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3274.16s)]
*  to try to take over cities, state governments, local governments, have a big presence in Congress. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3280.24s)]
*  They play the long game. We do not in the West. We don't play any game. Half the time we don't even know. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3290.24s)]

*  So this guy is the Democrat nominee for the mayor of New York City is both a Marxist and an Islamist. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3300.48s)]
*  They keep he's a social. He's not a socialist. He's a Marxist. Socialism is bad enough. That's an economic theory. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3309.04s)]
*  It's not an ideological doctrine. He's a Marxist who believes in socialism, and he's an Islamist. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3319.04s)]
*  He said so and then denied it. He's an anti-Semite. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3326.08s)]
*  Oh, no, I'm not. Just because I favor BDS, just because I'm opposed to Zionism, which means the state of Israel. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=3330.24s)]

*  Do it as politely as you can. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4834.959999999999s)]
*  OK? [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4837.32s)]
*  Just say, I want to have a discussion about what President Trump did in Israel and Iran. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4838.32s)]
*  I hope she's not the kind of coward that Colby Hall is, the head muckety muck under Dan Abrams [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4846.76s)]
*  over at Mediocre-I. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4853.72s)]
*  You can't miss Dan Abrams. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4854.72s)]
*  He has a squirrel glued to his head. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4857.4s)]
*  These guys that wear this stuff, they think you don't know. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4860.88s)]
*  It's like, oh, he's not bald. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4863.16s)]
*  But anyway, he's the Jerry Springer of cable and he's the yellow journalist of the entrails [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4865.32s)]
*  of the original media, Mediocre-I, with their headlines and so forth. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4872.3s)]
*  Over there, Drudge. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4877.78s)]
*  Did you see Drudge? [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4880.1s)]
*  Oh, yeah, very busy. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4881.1s)]
*  Very busy. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4882.78s)]
*  I don't think Drudge is around anymore. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4883.78s)]
*  I really don't. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4885.18s)]
*  I think he's in hiding and he's never coming out. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4888.02s)]
*  I think he eats peanut butter and jelly sandwiches three days a week. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4890.5s)]
*  What do you think of that, Rich? [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4894.02s)]
*  Maybe some white wine. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4897.76s)]
*  White wine and a peanut butter and jelly. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4901.219999999999s)]
*  That's about Drudge's speed, I think. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4902.42s)]
*  Something like that. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4904.339999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4905.339999999999s)]
*  Let's go to a... [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4906.339999999999s)]
*  I don't want to play any more Joy Reid. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4907.339999999999s)]
*  I can't stand the woman, to be perfectly honest with you. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4914.339999999999s)]
*  Now Mark Root is the NATO secretary general. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4917.379999999999s)]
*  And listen to this, cut 12, go. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4922.82s)]
*  I mean, we may do papers on it. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4924.82s)]
*  Mark Root may be looking to do papers. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4926.98s)]
*  I don't even know if you need them. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4927.98s)]
*  Cut 12. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4929.98s)]
*  Oh, you're right. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4930.98s)]
*  Keep it going. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4933.98s)]
*  Yep. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4934.98s)]
*  They've had a big fight, like two kids in a schoolyard. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4935.98s)]
*  You know they fight like hell. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4937.98s)]
*  You can't stop them. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4938.98s)]
*  Let them fight for about two, three minutes. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4939.98s)]
*  Then it's easier to stop them. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4940.98s)]
*  And then daddy has to sometimes use strong language to get them to stop. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4941.98s)]
*  Strong language. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4944.98s)]
*  This is the funny part. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4945.98s)]
*  He said, then daddy, then daddy has to sometimes use strong language to get them to stop. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4948.98s)]
*  That's the secretary general of NATO. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4957.98s)]
*  I'm laughing because there was a reporter who I was watching this who later asked, do [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4968.98s)]
*  you have respect for these NATO countries? [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4975.98s)]
*  And Trump's looking at, what are with these a-holes, these phony reports? [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4977.98s)]
*  Do you have respect? [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4981.98s)]
*  I mean, they're calling you daddy. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4984.98s)]
*  Do you treat them as children? [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4985.98s)]
*  When he used daddy, it had nothing to do with NATO. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4988.98s)]
*  And in the back, there's Rubio cracking up. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4992.98s)]
*  He's cracking up. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4996.98s)]
*  Because everyone, these reports, they're so negative, aren't they? [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=4998.98s)]
*  You don't get any positive questions. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5004.98s)]
*  I have positive questions. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5008.98s)]
*  How long did the pilots train for this mission? [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5010.98s)]
*  That's something interesting, isn't it, Mr. Producer? [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5012.98s)]
*  You know, something of that sort. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5017.98s)]
*  How long have these kinds of bombers been in production? [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5019.98s)]
*  Or the bombs themselves? [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5024.98s)]
*  You know, you won't be giving up national security secrets, but they're interesting questions. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5026.98s)]
*  I mean, I've got scores of them. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5031.98s)]
*  Rather than, we get this report, there's a leak that you didn't hit your target. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5033.98s)]
*  Now, let me ask you this. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5037.98s)]
*  How do you miss your target with bombs this powerful? [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5040.98s)]
*  It would be hard. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5046.98s)]
*  I don't mean the precision nature of it. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5048.98s)]
*  That's hard. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5050.98s)]
*  But it seems to me, and I could be wrong, even if you hit around the target, you're talking about 30,000 pounds of explosive rich. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5052.98s)]
*  You have to have these special bombers outfitted, the B-2 stealth bombers, to carry them. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5064.98s)]
*  You can't even put them on B-52s, which ought to all be replaced. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5070.98s)]
*  They're too old. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5074.98s)]
*  But nonetheless, I'll be right back. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5075.98s)]
*  Mutt Lopen. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5079.98s)]
*  You know what I'm amazed at, America? [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5094.98s)]
*  I'm always amazed at this. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5097.98s)]
*  All this stuff going on this week, all this stuff going on last week, the president gets on his plane, flies all the way to NATO, meets with these guys and gals. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5099.98s)]
*  He's flying all the way back, probably be back in an hour or so, based on what I'm looking at. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5108.98s)]
*  How does he keep this pace, Rich? Seriously? [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5114.98s)]
*  It's, it's... [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5118.98s)]
*  He has more events for tomorrow? [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5120.98s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5122.98s)]
*  I mean, when you compare this and Biden, Biden was not active for 40 percent of the time. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5123.98s)]
*  The 60 percent of the time they said he was active, he wasn't active. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5130.98s)]
*  It's incredible to me. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5135.98s)]
*  What's he 78 years old, something like that? [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5137.98s)]
*  I mean, I don't know how you do it when you're 50 years old. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5140.98s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5143.98s)]
*  Well, we're here with our friend Byron. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5145.98s)]
*  Donald Byron, how are you, sir? [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5148.98s)]
*  Mark, how you doing, my friend? [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5150.98s)]
*  I'm doing OK. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5152.98s)]
*  It's good to hear your voice. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5153.98s)]
*  Been a little while. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5154.98s)]
*  Now, a couple of things here. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5155.98s)]
*  What's with this Democrat nomination in New York, this guy? [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5159.98s)]
*  And you're from New York originally, so I'm asking you, Zahran Mamdani, what the hell is it? [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5163.98s)]
*  Help me with this, Byron. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5170.98s)]
*  I can't even pronounce his name. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5171.98s)]
*  I can't help you either. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5173.98s)]
*  Nobody knew who he was until last night. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5174.98s)]
*  Mamdani. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5177.98s)]
*  All right. Good for you, Mr. Bidus. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5178.98s)]
*  Did you vote for him? [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5179.98s)]
*  No, of course not. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5180.98s)]
*  All right. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5181.98s)]
*  Well, there you go. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5182.98s)]
*  Anyway, Byron, he's an Islamist. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5183.98s)]
*  He's a Marxist. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5186.98s)]
*  He helped found these students for whatever it is in Palestine. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5187.98s)]
*  He's he's he's BDS. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5192.98s)]
*  He's talking about having government run supermarkets, free public transport. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5195.98s)]
*  It's going on and on and on. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5202.98s)]
*  How do people vote for somebody like this? [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5204.98s)]
*  First, Mark, I don't know what's going on in the Democrat Party. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5207.98s)]
*  I don't think they know what's going on in that party. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5211.98s)]
*  But these guys are committed to the most insane policies that do not work, that have been proven economically. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5214.98s)]
*  They cannot work, but they just promote them loudly and they yell loudly about how they're going to fix everything. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5222.98s)]
*  I think New Yorkers are just as frustrated about everything else. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5228.98s)]
*  But as I was talking to a couple of friends today and I said, they elected a guy to fix affordability when it's the Democrat Party that created the affordability crisis because they overspend, they tax too much, they overregulate. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5231.98s)]
*  Prices go up on everybody and they think that more regulation is going to solve the thing that they already did. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5244.98s)]
*  So Biden broke it. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5250.98s)]
*  Kamala didn't know what she was doing. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5251.98s)]
*  AOC loves it. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5253.98s)]
*  And Mondani is now the Democrat nominee. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5255.98s)]
*  So if this is the way the Democrats are going to go, they're going to continue to lose. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5258.98s)]
*  I'm not sure about New York, but around the country, that's not going to fly. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5262.98s)]
*  I think you're right. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5266.98s)]
*  But let's think about New York City. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5267.98s)]
*  I mean, it's probably and I'm not putting down any other cities. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5269.98s)]
*  I love my home city of Philadelphia, but it's probably the most important city financially in many respects, other respects. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5273.98s)]
*  And the idea that you would have an Islamist Marxist who's as radical as hell, who's repeating the language of terrorists. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5280.98s)]
*  I'm not saying he's a terrorist, but he's repeating the language of them. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5290.98s)]
*  This global into father and then he and then he doubles down. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5293.98s)]
*  He says, No, no, no, that's just a statement of people who want to be free. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5297.98s)]
*  It doesn't mean that we know what it means. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5300.98s)]
*  The first into father, the second into father. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5302.98s)]
*  I'm just thinking out loud and he wants to massively increase taxes so you lose a corporate base. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5305.98s)]
*  You're not going to be able to even hire enough people to fill the police department, the NYPD or the fire department. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5312.98s)]
*  They're not going to want to work for a cook like this. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5317.98s)]
*  The teachers unions and others are going to run wild, you know, shaking them down for a fortune will be more than happy to to oblige. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5319.98s)]
*  I just think you're going to say a massive depopulation of New York and a repopulation of New York with individuals who share his ideology from all over the country, if not all over the world. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5327.98s)]
*  I think if he's elected, it's going to destroy the city once and for all. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5338.98s)]
*  You don't have to agree with me, but that's my view. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5341.98s)]
*  No, I agree with you. I'm going to tell you exactly what I think. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5344.98s)]
*  I think you're absolutely right on this. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5346.98s)]
*  I think it's really unfortunate to hardworking New Yorkers who just want common sense and they just want common sense policies to reign. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5348.98s)]
*  So they can live their lives. It's really a detriment to them. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5355.98s)]
*  The people who are going to continue to leave New York, they're coming to Florida, Mark. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5357.98s)]
*  They're going to continue to do that. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5361.98s)]
*  They're going to go to go to Texas. They're going to Tennessee. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5363.98s)]
*  They're looking at this guy is saying, I just can't anymore. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5365.98s)]
*  We are done. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5368.98s)]
*  And so, you know, a lot of the reason why people are leaving New York and Chicago and so many of these places and come into places like Florida is because we've had consistent governance over decades. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5369.98s)]
*  I mean, Governor DeSantis has done a tremendous job in Florida. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5380.98s)]
*  That's why so many people have moved to Florida and that's going to continue, Mark. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5383.98s)]
*  And so we're just going to make sure that we're the best state in the country continuously going into the future. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5386.98s)]
*  And people come in to come from New York or wherever they got to know in Florida. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5391.98s)]
*  We do business differently. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5396.98s)]
*  We are conservative. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5398.98s)]
*  We respect everybody's freedoms and rights. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5399.98s)]
*  We protect those. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5401.98s)]
*  But we're a conservative state with guiding principles. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5402.98s)]
*  And that's not going to change. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5405.98s)]
*  Yeah, that's why I love it here. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5408.98s)]
*  Now, the president really quite miraculously, brilliantly takes out the Iranian nuclear sites. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5410.98s)]
*  And look, if he wasn't the commander in chief, they'd still be there and it'd be a massive problem. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5419.98s)]
*  He's working closely with the Israelis and Bibi Netanyahu. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5424.98s)]
*  He put out a statement tonight praising the hell out of Netanyahu and condemning what they're. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5427.98s)]
*  Do you realize, Byron, that Bibi Netanyahu has to go to court on Monday? [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5432.98s)]
*  He's a wartime. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5437.98s)]
*  He's a wartime leader. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5438.98s)]
*  He has to go to court on Monday to defend his use of cigars. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5440.98s)]
*  Have you ever heard of anything like this? [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5443.98s)]
*  No, that's the dumbest thing I ever heard in my life. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5445.98s)]
*  The man is running a country. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5448.98s)]
*  He's trying to do everything he can to protect Israeli citizens and frankly be a bulwark against the insane radical anti-Semitic left. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5450.98s)]
*  And so to be called in the court over something so stupid. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5458.98s)]
*  Look, in this business, Mark, you understand that the craziness comes from any corner. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5461.98s)]
*  You just kind of have to always be ready. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5466.98s)]
*  But I think the thing that we've seen out of out of Bibi is he's not going to be deterred from leading Israel. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5468.98s)]
*  He's not going to be deterred on doing what he believes is the right thing to do in the interest of the Israeli people. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5474.98s)]
*  And really, he's the prime minister for a time such as this. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5480.98s)]
*  So Bibi, don't let the haters get you down. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5483.98s)]
*  Keep going. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5485.98s)]
*  And our tremendous president, he's historic, he's iconic, and he did something these other presidents wouldn't do. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5487.98s)]
*  Carter brought in the enemy in Iran and he one after another after that. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5495.98s)]
*  George Bush, Clinton, you have Obama, you have Biden. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5500.98s)]
*  They all said no nuclear weapons and not one of them lifted a finger to actually stop it. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5505.98s)]
*  And Trump comes in and he sees, you know, Biden funded all this. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5509.98s)]
*  He's muscled them up. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5513.98s)]
*  I can't let that. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5514.98s)]
*  Look, I'll negotiate and negotiate, but there's some point at which I got to do something about it. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5515.98s)]
*  Now, there's a lot of criticism of this from the Democrat Party, including the impeachment. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5519.98s)]
*  The impeachment ring over there, which is which is a big ring of morons. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5524.98s)]
*  But nonetheless, Hakeem Jeffries tonight says there's no we don't have the evidence that it did. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5528.98s)]
*  It's, you know, do what it's supposed to do. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5532.98s)]
*  Anything to diminish this man, but it's not going to work, is it? [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5534.98s)]
*  No, it's not. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5537.98s)]
*  President Trump made the absolute right call. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5539.98s)]
*  And you are correct. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5542.98s)]
*  So many presidents before him have stithered on this issue with nuclear Iran. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5543.98s)]
*  They were not doing the right thing. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5548.98s)]
*  You had the Obama administration and the Biden administration, which empowered this Robert Malley, this this left wing nut, they empowered him to make United States policy with Iran. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5549.98s)]
*  That was insane policy. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5560.98s)]
*  It only allowed the regime to get further down this road. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5562.98s)]
*  But Donald Trump, listen, for people who were saying, oh, we're getting dragged into another conflict. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5564.98s)]
*  The president's been clear on this thing for a while. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5569.98s)]
*  No nukes in Iran, but we're not putting boots on the ground. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5571.98s)]
*  And I firmly support that. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5574.98s)]
*  He did. He made the right call, making sure our bombers were in the air to take out those sites. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5576.98s)]
*  The world is safer today as a result. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5580.98s)]
*  And to some of my colleagues who believe that America first means that you cannot engage anywhere around the world, then they have forgotten the lessons when America ignores a radicalism like the Iranian regime. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5583.98s)]
*  The lessons are clear in history. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5594.98s)]
*  That is, we're going to go inject constitutional democracy in Iran. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5596.98s)]
*  I don't agree with that. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5600.98s)]
*  But you have to look this evil in the face and say you are not going to have weapons that can literally obliterate Tel Aviv at a moment's notice. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5602.98s)]
*  We're not going to let it happen. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5610.98s)]
*  The president made the right call. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5611.98s)]
*  The results have been great. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5613.98s)]
*  And, Mark, and you've seen this. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5614.98s)]
*  We've been warned about the Russians and the Chinese. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5616.98s)]
*  They haven't done anything. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5618.98s)]
*  Nothing. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5619.98s)]
*  And they won't. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5620.98s)]
*  Byron, stick with me. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5621.98s)]
*  I want to ask you, are we ever going to get a budget tax cut out of the Senate? [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5622.98s)]
*  What the hell's going on over there? [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5627.98s)]
*  I want to ask you about that. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5629.98s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5630.98s)]
*  We're here with Byron Donalds. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5643.98s)]
*  Byron, remind people what area of Florida you represent. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5644.98s)]
*  I represent Naples, Fort Myers, Marco Island, Sanibel, Etzeva Islands. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5647.98s)]
*  Those are hot areas, aren't they? [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5653.98s)]
*  I don't mean weather hot. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5655.98s)]
*  I mean they're hot areas for people to live in. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5656.98s)]
*  100%. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5659.98s)]
*  We get people moving there all the time. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5660.98s)]
*  It's a great place to live. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5662.98s)]
*  And from these last hurricanes, are they doing a little better? [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5663.98s)]
*  Building back okay or at least, you know? [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5668.98s)]
*  Yeah, in Southwest Florida, we've kind of recovered from Ian. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5671.98s)]
*  Helene and Milton did some water damage to our barrier islands. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5675.98s)]
*  But, you know, it's just a process. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5680.98s)]
*  You start moving further up where, you know, they really got hit like a cedar key. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5682.98s)]
*  They really got hit by Helene and Milton, Port Charlotte area, still trying to recover. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5686.98s)]
*  But it's just a process. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5690.98s)]
*  The biggest thing, Mark, is, you know, I'm glad the president's actually taking a strong look at FEMA, [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5691.98s)]
*  because FEMA's just been a disaster. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5695.98s)]
*  Like people think FEMA is this agency that comes in and helps everybody. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5697.98s)]
*  It's a bureaucratic mess. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5700.98s)]
*  And it's not been working. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5702.98s)]
*  It's slow. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5704.98s)]
*  And so President Trump, to his credit, being the commander in chief and being a leader, is saying enough is enough. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5705.98s)]
*  We're going to fix this thing once and for all. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5710.98s)]
*  So happy to see what his reforms look like. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5712.98s)]
*  So we got to be able to help people when the chips are down. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5714.98s)]
*  That's what America's about. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5716.98s)]
*  Now, what's going on in the Senate? [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5718.98s)]
*  The speaker seems a little frustrated. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5719.98s)]
*  They seem to be wanting to kind of mess around with everything. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5721.98s)]
*  And he's warning, look, I could barely put a majority together here. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5725.98s)]
*  You mess around with this too much. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5727.98s)]
*  I can't get a majority in the House, right? [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5729.98s)]
*  Yeah, that's a real thing. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5731.98s)]
*  And I think the Senate is, you know, typical of the upper chamber. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5733.98s)]
*  They think they know best. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5736.98s)]
*  You know, so they're trying to, you know, make some changes in there, doing their stuff, make some changes to tax policy. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5738.98s)]
*  They really have expanded this Green New Deal stuff. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5743.98s)]
*  And so they have actually made it longer. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5746.98s)]
*  What? [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5749.98s)]
*  Mark, I'm telling you, Mark, the House provision was going to sunset the terrible pieces of the those Green New Deal tax credits that Biden put in. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5750.98s)]
*  We were sunsetting them in 2028. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5758.98s)]
*  The Senate's perversion actually extended them to 2030, past President Trump's presidency. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5760.98s)]
*  And so in the House, you do have House members who are saying, this is nuts. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5765.98s)]
*  Why would we do that? [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5769.98s)]
*  We can't do that to the grid. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5770.98s)]
*  It's unreliable energy. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5772.98s)]
*  It's going to make it harder to power America into the future. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5773.98s)]
*  But that's in the Senate's version as it stands today. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5776.98s)]
*  Our hope is that they take the House's version when it comes to sunsetting those Green New Deal tax credits. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5779.98s)]
*  The president wants that. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5784.98s)]
*  That wants it out. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5785.98s)]
*  He tweeted that the other day. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5786.98s)]
*  President Trump is saying, no, get rid of it. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5787.98s)]
*  It's a scam. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5789.98s)]
*  And he's right. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5790.98s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5791.98s)]
*  I didn't even know that was going on. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5792.98s)]
*  I'm glad you told us. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5794.98s)]
*  I'm sure other shenanigans are going on too. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5795.98s)]
*  Yeah, it's happening in the background. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5797.98s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5798.98s)]
*  That's why it's going to take us a minute to finish this thing. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5799.98s)]
*  I think we can get it done though, to be honest with you. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5801.98s)]
*  Will we hit July 4th? [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5804.98s)]
*  I hope so. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5805.98s)]
*  I think we should get that done by then. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5806.98s)]
*  But the Senate has the bill right now. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5808.98s)]
*  We'll see what they come up with over the next couple of days. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5810.98s)]
*  The problem is if they don't get these tax cuts in place soon so they resonate throughout the economy, [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5812.98s)]
*  you got to make sure they resonate by the time the midterms are coming, you know? [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5817.98s)]
*  It's important. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5820.98s)]
*  I agree. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5821.98s)]
*  I think we're going to get tax done. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5822.98s)]
*  I think we're going to get it all done definitely before August. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5824.98s)]
*  So to compare it when we originally did tax cut and jobs act under the first Trump administration, [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5827.98s)]
*  that passed in December before the next midterm. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5833.98s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5836.98s)]
*  It's not going to wait that long. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5837.98s)]
*  We'll be definitely done, I'll say sometime in July. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5838.98s)]
*  I think maybe a week or two into July we'll be done. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5841.98s)]
*  The bigger thing is Tom Homan and Kristi Noem, they need the resources for the deportation force. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5844.98s)]
*  That's in the bill. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5851.98s)]
*  We have to get them that money immediately. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5852.98s)]
*  They need those resources so the president can actually keep his promise to the American people, [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5854.98s)]
*  not just securing the border, but sending people home who need to be out of the country. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5859.98s)]
*  My understanding there's only 5,000 full-time people on ICE and this would add another 10,000. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5864.98s)]
*  So that's what? [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5871.98s)]
*  Is that a 200% increase, something like that? [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5872.98s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5874.98s)]
*  I'm not a math guy. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5875.98s)]
*  You're a math guy. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5876.98s)]
*  Yeah, you did pretty good on the fly. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5877.98s)]
*  But no, we need the bodies. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5880.98s)]
*  We need the bed space. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5884.98s)]
*  Deporting a lot of people is a logistical operation and logistical operations take resources. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5885.98s)]
*  So we have a responsibility to deliver. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5891.98s)]
*  That's also in the one big beautiful bill. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5893.98s)]
*  We need to get that to the president's desk so he can fulfill his mandate that was given to him by the American people. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5896.98s)]
*  Well, Byron, our best to your family, your lovely wife, your two kids, from my wife as well. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5902.98s)]
*  You're a good man. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5908.98s)]
*  We appreciate you very much. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5909.98s)]
*  Thank you, my friend. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5911.98s)]
*  Take it easy. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5912.98s)]
*  You too. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5913.98s)]
*  Take care of yourself. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5914.98s)]
*  We're not getting into any political races till later. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5915.98s)]
*  We can't. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5919.98s)]
*  Not that he didn't ask, but there's a lot of people who do. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5920.98s)]
*  It's too early for me to do that or we'll get a flood of people in. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5923.98s)]
*  We'll deal with these things when we need to. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5926.98s)]
*  Right, Mr. Producer? [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5928.98s)]
*  It's too early anyway. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5930.98s)]
*  It's just too early. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5931.98s)]
*  But he's a very good man. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5933.98s)]
*  He's an excellent congressman. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5935.98s)]
*  See, see the callers here. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5936.98s)]
*  I got to pull it up. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5938.98s)]
*  Hello. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5939.98s)]
*  Hello. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5940.98s)]
*  Boy, this thing is slow today. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5941.98s)]
*  OK, click there, Mr. Producer. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5943.98s)]
*  And let's see what we have. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5947.98s)]
*  What do we have? [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5950.98s)]
*  Why is this? [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5951.98s)]
*  Oh, here we go. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5952.98s)]
*  All right, let's try it now. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5953.98s)]
*  Sorry, folks. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5955.98s)]
*  Let us go to. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5958.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5963.98s)]
*  Let's go to Sandra Gutenberg, New Jersey. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5965.98s)]
*  How are you, Sandra? [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5968.98s)]
*  I'm so glad you picked me. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5971.98s)]
*  I'm doing OK. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5973.98s)]
*  I just heard Rudy say on the TV that New York is facing a big emergency. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5974.98s)]
*  That's the word he used. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5982.98s)]
*  If this man, ma'am, Danny wins. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5983.98s)]
*  And I wanted to call you tonight to ask you your opinion about something that happened. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5985.98s)]
*  My friend called me. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5991.98s)]
*  She lives in the city. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5992.98s)]
*  I live in New Jersey, but she was in the city in one of the high rises. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5994.98s)]
*  And she said that man, Danny's staff, they went into her building with like authority, [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=5998.98s)]
*  like telling the concierge, we are authorized to go to these apartments, you know, [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6006.98s)]
*  and it was all Jewish names on the list. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6012.98s)]
*  And do what? [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6015.98s)]
*  And give the flyers to these people, slip them under their doors. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6017.98s)]
*  Now, that's not allowed, Mark, in any building to do anything like that. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6021.98s)]
*  But it just made me feel, you know, is this new beginnings? [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6026.98s)]
*  Resist old beginning? [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6030.98s)]
*  This this this this smells like like the Marxist police state. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6032.98s)]
*  When you want to do this to a city or a state or a country, [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6037.98s)]
*  basically bleed the liberty out of the of the environment there, [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6041.98s)]
*  whether it's businesses, whether it's homeownership, whether it's apartments or whatever it is. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6046.98s)]
*  You have a pretty big iron fist. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6052.98s)]
*  You really do. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6054.98s)]
*  And these people are going to get a big head and they're going to do all the worst things. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6056.98s)]
*  This guy has to be defeated. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6059.98s)]
*  I mean, he has to be defeated the polls. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6061.98s)]
*  Cuomo apparently didn't run much of a campaign. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6063.98s)]
*  They call it a Rose Garden campaign where you just stand there and hope everybody comes out. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6067.98s)]
*  I was watching him make some comments during the campaign. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6070.98s)]
*  You fall asleep. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6073.98s)]
*  They got to you know, he's he thought this was going to be handed to him. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6074.98s)]
*  And so this guy comes from nowhere. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6078.98s)]
*  They're working the streets. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6082.98s)]
*  You know, AOC is a good commie. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6083.98s)]
*  She knows how to work the streets. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6085.98s)]
*  They know the slogans to use, the words to use. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6086.98s)]
*  They get young people all worked up because in primaries, it's a matter of turnout. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6089.98s)]
*  That's the issue. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6092.98s)]
*  Even more than a general election. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6093.98s)]
*  It's turnout. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6094.98s)]
*  That's how you get the nomination. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6095.98s)]
*  One saving grace, which is surprising, since I don't like the voting system there. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6097.98s)]
*  You've got all these independent lines. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6102.98s)]
*  You got our buddy Curtis Sleba who can run it as a Republican. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6104.98s)]
*  You'll have others who are running on on others. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6107.98s)]
*  You got the current mayor is running as an independent and so forth and so on. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6109.98s)]
*  The issue is they got to get behind somebody. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6112.98s)]
*  Otherwise, this jerk's going to slip in. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6115.98s)]
*  And whether he gets 40 percent of the vote or 60 percent of the vote, if he slips in, he's the mayor. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6118.98s)]
*  And I want the people of New York to understand something. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6124.98s)]
*  The effect that this is going to have in every single community, every single one of the people in the world. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6127.98s)]
*  And I want America to understand this will be viewed as the future. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6131.98s)]
*  This will be viewed as precedent for more of this to take place in your states and your cities. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6136.98s)]
*  So, I mean, this is this is a big problem. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6141.98s)]
*  I've already seen the Islamists in the media. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6144.98s)]
*  They're very giddy. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6147.98s)]
*  They're interviewing him or they're talking about him. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6149.98s)]
*  They see a great opportunity here. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6151.98s)]
*  Groups like care, which is a Hamas front group. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6153.98s)]
*  Students for justice and power. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6156.98s)]
*  All the usual Islamist front organizations, they're going to be working very, very hard all over the country, maybe internationally to get this load elected. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6158.98s)]
*  So it's a big deal. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6169.98s)]
*  Thank you for your call. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6171.98s)]
*  I really appreciate it, Sandra. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6172.98s)]
*  Very good. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6173.98s)]
*  Let's see. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6174.98s)]
*  Let's continue. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6175.98s)]
*  David Staten Island, New York's wide awake. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6176.98s)]
*  Staten Island, New York, go right ahead, please. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6179.98s)]
*  How do you mark many years ago in 1979 when the Shah of Iran was being kicked out? [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6183.98s)]
*  Not only did I say Russia and Iran working together, I also predicted, which I heard recently, the son of the Shah may be coming back if they could change regime. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6190.98s)]
*  I am ever so praying for that. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6202.98s)]
*  I don't bother me. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6206.98s)]
*  It doesn't bother me in the least, as long as it's not these Islamist regimes. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6208.98s)]
*  And you know what's happening today and tonight in Iran, sir? [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6213.98s)]
*  They're executing people and they're having mass rounds, roundup people imprisoning them. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6217.98s)]
*  So I think they fear for their future and they're going to try and do everything they can to make sure they don't lose it. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6224.98s)]
*  And so the truly hideous nature of this genocidal monstrous regime, its tentacles are still in play. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6231.98s)]
*  It's still going on. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6240.98s)]
*  The Persian people are being abused like hell. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6241.98s)]
*  There's something else I should tell you. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6244.98s)]
*  All those rockets shot over Israel could have been nukes. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6246.98s)]
*  Iran is very serious about destroying everything that they can't have until they get what they want. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6250.98s)]
*  They're not going to give up. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6257.98s)]
*  No, they're not going to give up. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6258.98s)]
*  There's absolutely no question about it. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6260.98s)]
*  That regime has to be destroyed by somebody one day or another one way or another. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6262.98s)]
*  People say, well, that's regime change. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6268.98s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6270.98s)]
*  Yes. When we destroyed the Third Right, that was regime change. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6271.98s)]
*  When we kicked the British out of the Americas, that was regime change. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6274.98s)]
*  They use these names and they went to, oh, my God, oh, my God, it's going to be Iraq all over again. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6278.98s)]
*  It has nothing to do with Iraq, but they don't care. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6283.98s)]
*  They undermine our country. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6286.98s)]
*  They undermine our country. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6287.98s)]
*  They undermine our president. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6288.98s)]
*  They undermine our troops. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6289.98s)]
*  And we're not going to forget. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6290.98s)]
*  All right. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6291.98s)]
*  We appreciate your call, Dave. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6292.98s)]
*  Take care of yourself. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6294.98s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6295.98s)]
*  Month. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6296.98s)]
*  Love. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6297.98s)]
*  In. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6298.98s)]
*  I'm disappointed in myself, Mr. Producer. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6309.98s)]
*  So I went and I've got some spaghetti meatballs from a nice restaurant. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6311.98s)]
*  And it's sitting there awaiting me, Mr. Producer. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6321.98s)]
*  What did I forget? [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6324.98s)]
*  I can't eat cheese. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6325.98s)]
*  I'm lactose intolerant. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6329.98s)]
*  I forgot Italian bread. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6330.98s)]
*  How the hell do you eat that? [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6332.98s)]
*  Now you're Italian. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6334.98s)]
*  Do you eat spaghetti meatballs without Italian bread? [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6336.98s)]
*  Nobody does. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6338.98s)]
*  Well, it drives me nuts right now. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6340.98s)]
*  I'm like, wait a minute. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6342.98s)]
*  I actually got the spaghetti and meatballs to eat the bread. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6343.98s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6346.98s)]
*  Because I love bread. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6347.98s)]
*  Bread's like cake to me, especially Italian bread. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6348.98s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6351.98s)]
*  I think my favorite food is Italian food, actually. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6352.98s)]
*  I love Chinese food, but like once every 10 days. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6356.98s)]
*  But Italian food, I can eat three days a week. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6360.98s)]
*  Plus, when I go to the Italian restaurant, I'm just being, and these people, they're [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6363.98s)]
*  recognizable. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6369.98s)]
*  The ethnicity of the Italians is almost like Jews, the way I grew up. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6372.98s)]
*  It's like, hey, you want more? [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6376.98s)]
*  Hey, hey, hey, what about this? [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6378.98s)]
*  This is how I grew up. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6380.98s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6381.98s)]
*  You sure you don't want more? [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6383.98s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, sure. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6385.98s)]
*  But I kind of miss that. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6386.98s)]
*  Let me take a call here, too, if we can. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6391.98s)]
*  Let's see here. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6396.98s)]
*  Let us go to Roevi. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6398.98s)]
*  San Diego, California, Sirius XM satellite. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6401.98s)]
*  Yes, Roevi. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6404.98s)]
*  Hi, Mark. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6406.98s)]
*  Thank you so much for taking my call. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6407.98s)]
*  Yes. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6409.98s)]
*  So first of all, just a quick thanks to President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu for the [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6410.98s)]
*  amazing job they did in really pushing back Iran's nuclear program. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6414.98s)]
*  But just a quick point is that Iran says they saved most of the 400 kilograms of highly [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6420.98s)]
*  enriched uranium and they may have a number of centrifuges left and therefore the threat [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6425.98s)]
*  still persists even in the short term. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6433.98s)]
*  Well, it might, but moving that material is not as easy as it sounds. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6435.98s)]
*  You don't just throw it in trucks. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6440.98s)]
*  Right. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6442.98s)]
*  And moving centrifuges is a very complicated task. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6443.98s)]
*  So there may be some of that. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6446.98s)]
*  There may be hidden sites that are unknown and so forth, and at some point they may have to be [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6448.98s)]
*  dealt with. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6452.98s)]
*  But I can tell you if they're doing a full blown nuclear program and missiles, they're not going [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6454.98s)]
*  to be able to do that. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6459.98s)]
*  I don't think certainly not now with a lot more ability to do so because a lot of the sites, [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6461.98s)]
*  they're interactive. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6469.98s)]
*  They're not necessarily repetitive. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6471.98s)]
*  One site does this. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6473.98s)]
*  One site does that. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6474.98s)]
*  Ineffectively, it's an assembly line of things that have to be done. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6475.98s)]
*  And it's been badly, badly disrupted. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6479.98s)]
*  So even if you have nuclear material, there's not necessarily anything you can do with it. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6482.98s)]
*  It just depends on how it's been processed. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6485.98s)]
*  I'm no expert. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6489.98s)]
*  And I'm not bringing an expert on because if I do it, it'll take an hour and a half and your eyes [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6491.98s)]
*  will roll over. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6494.98s)]
*  Thank you, Roewe. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6495.98s)]
*  We salute our armed forces, police officers, firefighters, emergency personnel, our men and women. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6496.98s)]
*  Our truckers too. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6502.98s)]
*  And the men and women in Ukraine and Israel. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6504.98s)]
*  And the president, a special salute. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6507.98s)]
*  God bless him. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6509.98s)]
*  Man, does he take more crap and does he give it back? [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6510.98s)]
*  I'll see you tomorrow. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6513.98s)]
*  God bless. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye46CPU8Jx0&t=6514.98s)]
