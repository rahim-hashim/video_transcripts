Video Description: On Wednesday’s Mark Levin Show, there’s a CNN poll showing 79% of Americans (83% Republicans, 79% Democrats/independents) oppose Iran’s nuclear ambitions, with a slight majority favoring U.S. airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear sites (69% of Republicans agree, 27% oppose).  This refutes the small group of isolationists, amplified by the media, who downplay Iran’s threat and align with left-wing narratives, asserting most Americans support Trump’s strong stance on national security. These isolationist voices are paper tigers who align with left-wing media to downplay Iran’s threat and question intelligence on Iran’s nuclear program and assassination attempts against President Trump. They are ideologically driven and out of touch with red-blooded Americans who prioritize national security and common-sense foreign policy. Also, Roger Zakheim, Director of the Ronald Reagan Institute, calls in to discuss a comprehensive Reagan Institute Summer Survey. It highlights key issues impacting U.S. security and prosperity, with preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon topping the list at 84%, reflecting widespread concern about nuclear proliferation. Americans expressed strong support for Israel striking Iran’s nuclear program, even before recent events. Zakheim explained that nearly 90% of Republican respondents, aligned with Trump’s base, favor action against Iran’s nuclear ambitions.  Later, Communist China, and their genocidal Marxist dictator Xi, is watching closely what's taking place in Iran.  If we were weak or equivocating, they would take that as a signal to more aggressive seek global domination.  If we were resolute and strong, they would take that into consideration -- not necessarily preventing them from eventually acting but perhaps reassessing how aggressive they would want to be.  President Trump's historical leadership has sent exactly the right message to Xi.  Resolve and strength.

# Isolationists vs. Patriots: The Battle Over America's Role in Iran
**The Mark Levin Show:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo)
*  Ladies and gentlemen, this next segment of the podcast is brought to you by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=0.0s)]
*  For over 50 years, the Great Heritage Foundation has been America's outpost in Washington, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4.8s)]
*  fighting against the D.C. federal bureaucracy and working to secure a future that allows Americans [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=9.52s)]
*  to live the good life. For too long, common sense principles have been ignored by many of the very [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=14.64s)]
*  leaders claiming to fight for America, but the Heritage Foundation is proud to hold our leaders [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=19.28s)]
*  accountable and stand up for America's founding principles, paid for by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=23.6s)]
*  He's here. Now, broadcasting from the underground command post, deep in the bowels of a hidden [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=30.48s)]
*  bunker, somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=38.0s)]
*  we once again make contact with our leader, Mark LeVein. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  Hello, America. Mark LeVein here, our number 877-381-3811, 877-381-3811, tons, and I mean tons going on. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=120.88s)]
*  We'll try and fit it in three hours. Probably need a Jerry Lewis telethon, Mr. Producer, to get it all in, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=133.28s)]
*  but we're not going to get that. We will do the very best we can. But I want to start with something [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=139.84s)]
*  very interesting, something I already knew. I knew in my gut. I knew in my gut, as I'll explain [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=145.92s)]
*  after you listen to this. This is his fellow, Harry Inton, the CNN Chief Data Analyst. This guy makes [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=151.6s)]
*  boring polls sound exciting, fabulous, incredible. They're lucky to have him. I think he's the only [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=158.48s)]
*  guy over there worth having, other than the conservative, and I don't mean to be rude, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=165.76s)]
*  whose name I can't remember. What is his name? Scott Jennings. Sorry there, Scott. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=169.84s)]
*  I want you to listen to Harry Inton. This is very important to you, I'm sure. CNN Chief Data Analyst, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=175.84s)]
*  cut 17, go. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=181.28s)]
*  I'm from April. If Iran's trying to make a nuclear weapon, look at this. Overall, you get the slight [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=229.76s)]
*  plurality. I mean it's within the margin of error, but the slight plurality of Americans actually [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=235.12s)]
*  favor U.S. airstrikes compared to 47% opposing it. Now here's the other nugget I'll note, right? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=238.79999999999998s)]
*  There's been a lot of talk online and on social media and in podcasts of a divide within the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=243.76s)]
*  Republican ranks. But here on this question, if Iran's trying to make a nuclear weapon, look at that, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=248.95999999999998s)]
*  69% of Republicans, the clear vast majority of Republicans, favor U.S. airstrikes on Iran, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  on their nuclear facilities. But there is this substantial minority, 27%, who oppose such an idea. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=259.28s)]
*  So it's not surprising you're hearing those other voices besides Donald Trump out there. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=264.55999999999995s)]
*  There are plenty of them in the Republican ranks who oppose striking, the U.S. striking Iran if [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=268.4s)]
*  they're trying to make a nuclear weapon. But the clear majority, the clear majority of Republicans [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=273.67999999999995s)]
*  are with Donald Trump if in fact Iran is trying to make nuclear weapons. They do in fact potentially [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=278.47999999999996s)]
*  favor U.S. airstrikes. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=283.03999999999996s)]
*  So to cut through all this, and he does a tremendous job, 69% of Americans, so seven out of, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=285.03999999999996s)]
*  excuse me, 69% of Republicans, seven out of ten Republicans believe that the U.S. should hit [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=293.35999999999996s)]
*  our bombers, Iran's nuclear sites. 70%, 69%. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=302.0s)]
*  And in terms of making sure that Iran does not have nuclear weapons, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=307.76s)]
*  incredible, 83% of Republicans, 79% of Democrats, 79% of independents. So you see, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=318.24s)]
*  ladies and gentlemen, the isolationists, I've been telling you this for week after week after week, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=323.92s)]
*  it's a small cabal. That's what it is. They have platforms. Then they are, those platforms, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=329.36s)]
*  when they make their outrageous statements and do their outrageous things, they are [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=337.2s)]
*  cycled through entities like MediaEight and the Drudge Report and so forth and so on to try and [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=342.47999999999996s)]
*  give them a voice. Why? Because they want you to believe that the Republican Party is like the [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=347.44s)]
*  Democrat Party when it comes to national security, when it comes to taking out nuclear warheads, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=353.2s)]
*  or potentially when it comes to Israel. It's all a lie, as again I've been trying to say. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=360.32s)]
*  Now this battle over the last month with me and the isolationists has exposed them. They're feckless. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=367.84s)]
*  They're paper tigers. That's what they are. And then they turn on Donald Trump. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=375.28s)]
*  And then Donald Trump turns on them. And then they have a problem, a big problem. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=381.03999999999996s)]
*  But red-blooded Americans are not isolationists, appeasers, pacifists. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=388.48s)]
*  We're people with common sense. People believe you look at a situation, you figure out who the [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=393.36s)]
*  good guys are and the bad guys are. If you can help, we help. It's not about a forever war. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=398.4s)]
*  It's not about World War III. The American people aren't buying any of this crap. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=402.88s)]
*  And they know Iran. We know Iran. They've been with us for 47 years, this regime. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=409.2s)]
*  They've killed Americans, American soldiers. They've tried to assassinate our president. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=415.76s)]
*  They've tried to assassinate our president. What's getting interesting now, you might recall a couple [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=420.71999999999997s)]
*  of weeks ago, ladies and gentlemen, when I was dealing with Katarlsen, who really is a paper tiger, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=424.88s)]
*  absolutely lightweight, and his following is an inch deep. When I was dealing with him, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=433.28s)]
*  you'll notice the Politico. Rachel Bade came to his defense. Then the Independent came to his [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=438.96s)]
*  defense. Then Media Ocarite came to his defense. Then the Daily Beastiality came to his defense. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=444.56s)]
*  Then the Huffington Comp, all these outlier media entrails, same left-wing ideologues, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=450.08s)]
*  same Democrat mouthpieces and so forth and so on in terms of their mindset. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=458.08s)]
*  They question the intelligence about the nuclear sites. They question the intelligence [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=463.59999999999997s)]
*  about the attempts to assassinate Donald Trump. We actually have a case at the Department of Justice. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=470.8s)]
*  I believe it was started in the Biden administration. So just like Biden isn't [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=476.24s)]
*  as dumb as he sounds and seems and walks and talks. No, no, no. So the same media and their [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=480.40000000000003s)]
*  entrails, except this time with the isolationists, want you to believe Iran's not a threat. They don't [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=486.48s)]
*  have nukes. Look at them. What exactly is Israel bombing? Civilian energy sites? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=494.48s)]
*  We all know. We see it. We hear it. Just like we did with Biden, just like we did with the Hunter [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=501.76000000000005s)]
*  laptop. They're pulling the same thing, except this time they have the isolationists, almost as a fifth [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=506.8s)]
*  column, as a fifth column in this country, joining with them. They're ideological. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=513.2s)]
*  Ideological knuckleheads. We're going to have a guest on in the second hour who's going to explain [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=519.2s)]
*  what their surveys found. Very thorough, very comprehensive surveys, very similar [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=525.76s)]
*  to the CNN poll, very similar. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=531.92s)]
*  Donald Trump's position has been known from day one. We should be supporting what he's trying to do now. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=537.52s)]
*  We should be supporting the prime minister of Israel. We should be supporting the Israeli [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=545.04s)]
*  military. We should be supporting our military. We should be supporting the Israeli military. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=549.84s)]
*  We should be supporting our military. We should encourage them to work as closely together as [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=554.24s)]
*  possible to wipe out this enemy, their nuclear weapons, in which they want to kill us. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=559.9200000000001s)]
*  That's the bottom line. I understand why Tlaib and Omar and AOC and Sanders and the rest of the [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=569.12s)]
*  Marxist Islamists are not with us, but these people who've turned on us, these people who've [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=576.64s)]
*  turned on us, these isolationists with their podcasts and their subscription services and all the rest, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=582.88s)]
*  hell to them. When the rubber hit the road, they're on the side of the enemy. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=590.16s)]
*  They'll say they're not, but they are. They're on the side of Tlaib. They're on the side of Bernie [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=597.6s)]
*  Sanders. They sound like Bernie Sanders. And I don't want to hear this stuff. I guess we will, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=602.8s)]
*  but I don't want to hear it. I support Israel, but I oppose war. Well, good for you. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=607.36s)]
*  The problem for Israel is they're under attack constantly on all sides. So you may oppose war [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=611.36s)]
*  sitting here in the United States. That's a wonderful thing. But when you're under attack [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=618.48s)]
*  in direct ways and terrorist ways and other ways, and you have been for 47 years by the same [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=623.92s)]
*  primitive, barbarian, seventh century Islamists, you can't just preach, you know, I support Israel, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=630.0s)]
*  you know, I support Israel, but I oppose war. I see General Michael Flynn. General Michael Flynn [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=638.08s)]
*  has made the point. I'm against stupid wars, but I'm not necessarily against war. And when the state [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=644.5600000000001s)]
*  of Israel is under attack, directly and indirectly, I support if necessary, a war to stop it. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=651.6s)]
*  But 80% of the American people, 83% agree with you and me and the president, 83%. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=658.96s)]
*  And 69% of Republicans believe that the United States should participate in blowing out [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=672.88s)]
*  these nuclear sites. Completely different than what you've been hearing on cable, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=681.0400000000001s)]
*  completely different than what you've been hearing from podcasters, many of them, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=686.88s)]
*  some are conservative talk radio. Again, I will tell you for the 5000th time, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=691.04s)]
*  Rush always told me, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=697.4399999999999s)]
*  respect your audience, respect their intelligence. When I come behind here, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=700.88s)]
*  I'm talking to you. I'm not talking to the entrails. I'm not talking to the isolation. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=708.08s)]
*  I'm talking to you. And you know, I give you the truth. I give you the information I have. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=713.12s)]
*  You don't necessarily have to agree with me. That's okay. That's not the point. But I'll give you the [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=718.24s)]
*  best information I have. That's not what you get in American media. That's not what you get from [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=723.36s)]
*  media in the Drudge Report, Politico and Axios. Axios is the favorite leaking point of the [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=728.4s)]
*  isolationists who side with Hamas in some instances, but clearly side with the Iranian [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=735.12s)]
*  government. You can't say, no, no, we can't use military action or we can't back up the Israelis [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=742.16s)]

*  you're for Israel, but you're not for Iran. No, you're for Iran. It's a practical matter. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=752.8s)]
*  Putting aside words as a practical matter, you're for Iran. Just have the guts to say so. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=759.28s)]
*  Just have the guts to say so. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=767.76s)]
*  Now, Ted Cruz was a great man, great patriot. I've known him for decades. What you see is what you [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=772.7199999999999s)]

*  and an isolationist. His head is screwed on tight. His head is screwed on tight. I'm going to play [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=791.76s)]

*  That's the kind of stupidity. And MediaEye thought that was great. Why? Because MediaEye [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=837.12s)]
*  is in the camp of the isolationists. Anything to attack Trump or to attack conservatives, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=843.36s)]
*  they are in the camp of the isolationists. We tried to get one of the gentlemen on this program. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=849.52s)]

*  She wouldn't answer. We tried to get the reporter for the Independent. She lied too. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=897.84s)]

*  These isolationists, some of whom we've known from the past, who seem to be fairly rational, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=1024.48s)]
*  but they seem to have lost it, have decided they're disgruntled. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=1031.2s)]
*  That's what motivates them. That's why they hate Fox, which you love. Fox's writings are through [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=1034.96s)]
*  the roof. That's why they attack wildly. Anybody who came before them, that's why they claim that [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=1039.6000000000001s)]
*  they're new and different when they're definitely different, but what they spew is not new. They're [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=1050.0s)]
*  disgruntled. They're disgruntled. They couldn't hold a radio show. They couldn't hold a cable show. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=1056.96s)]
*  And so they lash out, and they take these perverse positions. Some of them actually believe it, I [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=1068.6399999999999s)]
*  guess. And they expect you to follow along. That's the truth. And so at this point over the last [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=1073.6s)]
*  five weeks or so, you've seen, you've been lied to by these people. There's not a regional war. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=1082.64s)]
*  There's not World War III. There is a nuclear program that the Israelis are bombing night [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=1090.0s)]
*  after night in one place they can't quite get to yet. The Iranians did try to assassinate our [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=1096.48s)]
*  president. These are all true. They're all true. They even bring in a conga line of anti-Semites, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=1104.88s)]
*  comics, who trash our country, comics, who trash Israel and Jews. And by the way, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=1114.88s)]
*  now you have these people trashing evangelical Christians. Evangelical Christians are rising [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=1123.68s)]
*  up and supporting Israel and defending Israel as they always do. Fantastic people. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=1128.56s)]
*  And then they attack the president of the United States, the man who's saving our country. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=1136.48s)]
*  Now I think they've exposed themselves to anybody who will watch and listen [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=1144.08s)]
*  and re-center themselves. I'll be right back. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=1150.48s)]

*  Keep going. What do I say? I speak to him every day. He's a good man, doing a lot. He's been very [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=1262.8799999999999s)]
*  unfairly treated by his country, I think. Very unfairly treated. Have you given him an indication [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=1269.84s)]
*  that you may seek to aid them more than you have already? No. So far he's doing a good job. He has [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=1275.2s)]

*  much with it himself. A wartime president, he's going through this nonsense. It's ridiculous. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=1301.8400000000001s)]

*  security. Now one of them has asked about how dangerous these nuclear sites are. It's just, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=1345.6s)]
*  are you close to making a decision? What did you tell Bibi? Are we making a decision? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=1352.72s)]
*  It's really terrible. So the American people, even with the U.S. nuclear power, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=1357.04s)]
*  even with a corrupt media like this, even with the grifters and the isolationists, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=1363.28s)]

*  right there. It's in Jerusalem and the rest of Israel. You know, and you know what the Islamist [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=1409.4399999999998s)]

*  Look at this. Look at what the Israelis have done since last Friday evening, Mr. Producer. Is it not astonishing? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=1439.36s)]
*  You know, Katarelson wants to know how many people live in Iran. You can Google that. It's about 100 million. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=1444.4799999999998s)]

*  And when you add up the other nations around Israel, the Arab nations, you're talking about [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=1472.56s)]
*  well over a quarter of a billion to a third of a billion people. And Israel has adults 6 million. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=1480.3999999999999s)]

*  Carlson, except the really extreme anti-Semitic radicals, they'll stick with him. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=2758.12s)]

*  Very important. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=2856.6s)]
*  If electoral politics has taught us anything in the past 20 years, it's that every vote [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=2858.04s)]
*  counts. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=2864.7599999999998s)]

*  D.C. that would love to see America shrink from the world stage concerning Israel. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=2879.04s)]
*  We should judge President Trump for what he does, not by what other people say. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=2885.92s)]
*  No president in Israel's history has done more to support the Jewish people than President [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=2892.2400000000002s)]
*  Trump. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=2898.6s)]
*  From moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, the Abraham Accords and all [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=2900.14s)]
*  that he did to strengthen Israel in the region in his first term, consider that in his second [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=2907.32s)]
*  term, he thus far approved and expedited billions in military weapons and assistance [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=2914.36s)]

*  and fight our mutual enemies. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=2931.0s)]
*  The president understands Iran must never be permitted to have nuclear weapons, period. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=2934.2400000000002s)]
*  I do not think President Trump will allow himself to be played by Iranian negotiators [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=2942.48s)]
*  or American isolationist. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=2949.36s)]
*  When it's all said and done, I believe President Trump is willing to do what it takes to ensure [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=2953.08s)]
*  Iran is defanged, either by enabling our strongest ally Israel to defend itself or otherwise. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=2961.12s)]
*  I love this man. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=2970.32s)]

*  He speaks with moral clarity. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=2973.54s)]
*  And this is why he has a massive church. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=2976.5s)]
*  And this is why he has a massive following even outside his church. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=2980.4199999999996s)]

*  I'm grateful for the opportunity to chat about the survey. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3080.2999999999997s)]
*  We've been doing this survey where we get the views of the American people on foreign [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3084.2999999999997s)]
*  policy, national security, and defense issues since 2018. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3087.9399999999996s)]
*  We think it's the deepest dive into the views of the American people on these subjects, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3092.4199999999996s)]
*  meaning nobody else is really doing this as consistent as we are, kind of covering the [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3096.22s)]
*  range of issues. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3100.2999999999997s)]
*  We put this in the field in the end of May and wrapped it up on June 2nd. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3102.9s)]
*  It goes out to over 1,000 people asking them, particularly on this issue that you've been [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3107.9s)]
*  leading on in terms of what their views are on Iran, Iran's nuclear weapons program, and [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3114.58s)]
*  what their views would be if Israel were to strike. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3120.9s)]
*  Of course, we asked these questions prior to the event six days ago, six plus days ago. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3123.7000000000003s)]
*  It turns out, Mark, that the American people are very concerned about Iran's nuclear weapons [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3129.3s)]
*  program and that they'd be supportive of Israel striking that program. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3134.5800000000004s)]
*  That was all before the events of six days ago. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3140.82s)]
*  84 percent. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3143.9s)]
*  That's a big number. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3145.7400000000002s)]
*  You can't get 84 percent to agree on anything, can you, Roger? [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3146.7400000000002s)]
*  Certainly not in our political domain. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3151.3s)]
*  We asked, we said, hey, what sort of issue concerns you most when it comes to your security [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3155.46s)]
*  and prosperity? [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3161.18s)]
*  What matters to you? [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3162.18s)]
*  Preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, as you just referenced, came out. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3165.26s)]
*  84 percent of Americans say that matters to their security, outperforming Russia and Ukraine [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3169.54s)]
*  or China and Taiwan. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3177.82s)]
*  Now, Americans are quite concerned about both of those, coming to about 75 percent and 73 [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3179.1s)]
*  percent, respectively. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3183.86s)]
*  But nothing else is as close in the mind of the Americans or what matters to them more [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3185.34s)]
*  than how do we prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon? [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3190.82s)]
*  As President Trump sits with this decision now in terms of what, if any, U.S. role will [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3195.5s)]
*  be in completing the work of Israel, he stands on not just solid footing but overwhelming [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3201.06s)]
*  support from the American people on this issue because they care about it. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3208.1400000000003s)]
*  It matters to American people and clearly it matters to President Trump. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3212.3799999999997s)]
*  Do you see some similarities, I do, with Reagan and Trump, peace through strength, make America [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3217.02s)]
*  great again? [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3223.62s)]
*  Both of them wanted to avoid wars. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3224.62s)]
*  I mean, Reagan defeated the Soviet Union without any direct confrontation whatsoever and yet [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3227.2599999999998s)]
*  he built up the military. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3232.9399999999996s)]
*  They knew he meant business. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3234.62s)]
*  He took out most of the Iranian Navy at one point. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3235.66s)]
*  There were other things we did, bombed Gaddafi's palace when he was, boy, he wasn't there, [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3240.38s)]
*  but he got the message after that he was back in his box and he gave up his nukes and I [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3246.1400000000003s)]
*  could go on and on and on. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3250.6200000000003s)]
*  In other words, Reagan, Reagan wasn't a quote unquote warmonger, but he was a powerful commander [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3251.6200000000003s)]
*  in chief, a prudential commander in chief. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3257.5s)]
*  And again, this whole idea of peace through strength was his, no? [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3259.6600000000003s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3264.2200000000003s)]
*  President Trump is the first president since President Reagan to run on a peace through [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3265.3799999999997s)]
*  strength platform, powerful and prudential, I think would describe President Reagan's [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3271.4599999999996s)]
*  approach to being commander in chief and what he did during his eight years in office. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3277.62s)]
*  And yes, President Trump is looking to do the same and has done the same, certainly as [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3282.1s)]
*  relates to Iran with the Somali strike in his first term. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3286.8199999999997s)]
*  And this idea of peace was, of course, top of mind and essential because of what President [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3291.06s)]
*  Reagan thought to achieve in his time in office. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3298.02s)]
*  And we're seeing that now as a defining sort of framework in which President Trump is [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3300.1s)]
*  approaching certainly the second term. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3305.14s)]
*  But it's the kind of peace, the nature of the peace is really what the debate's about. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3307.54s)]
*  And it's one that's backed by strength and is a meaningful piece, a lasting piece that [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3311.7799999999997s)]
*  actually makes Americans safer, not the sort of false peace that would allow Iran in this [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3315.94s)]
*  case to maintain a nuclear weapons program. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3321.78s)]
*  That is not the peace that makes us more secure. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3324.66s)]
*  And that's really what this debate is about. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3326.82s)]
*  And of course, President Reagan led on that debate during his time in office as related [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3328.66s)]
*  to the Cold War. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3332.66s)]
*  I mean, it was essential for Americans to understand that we had to have a true peace [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3333.38s)]
*  with the Soviet Union. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3338.26s)]
*  That was actually we winning and the Soviets losing. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3339.14s)]
*  That was President Reagan's approach. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3343.06s)]
*  You know, Roger, I look at this today, you step back and kind of push away all the static [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3346.66s)]
*  and just use your own noggin. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3352.1s)]
*  You're talking about 84 percent. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3354.5s)]
*  That tells me there really isn't a great debate in the Republican Party or even in the country. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3356.02s)]
*  But the Democrats there is, I mean, they are isolationists. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3362.18s)]
*  They hate Israel. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3365.7000000000003s)]
*  They undermine our own country. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3366.58s)]
*  This is just my opinion. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3367.78s)]
*  And the so-called isolationists, you realize what a small percentage of the population [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3369.7000000000003s)]
*  they really represent, whether it is sort of the extremists on one end or the extremists [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3375.06s)]
*  or the other. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3380.18s)]
*  And the extremists on both ends, as you know, they call this the shoe horse effect. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3381.2999999999997s)]
*  They really are in agreement on foreign policy, which isn't much of a foreign policy where [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3386.66s)]
*  the rest of the nation does not agree with them. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3391.22s)]
*  Your figure is 84 percent. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3393.06s)]
*  CNN came within something like this, about 80 percent. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3394.66s)]
*  That's the number. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3398.1s)]
*  Eight out of 10, eight and a half out of 10 Americans. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3399.06s)]
*  That is a big deal. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3401.94s)]
*  So I think the American people are not divided on this. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3403.62s)]
*  I don't think the Republican Party is divided on this. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3407.7s)]
*  I think there's some elements who claim there's division on this, want there to be division [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3410.34s)]
*  on this. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3416.1s)]
*  What do you think of that? [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3416.58s)]
*  I couldn't agree with you more. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3419.22s)]
*  I mean, there's this isolationist pocket that has outside influence and makes a lot more [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3420.34s)]
*  noise than it truly is in terms of the percentage representation of the Republican Party. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3426.66s)]
*  President Reagan, President Trump, excuse me, made clear that he speaks. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3433.54s)]
*  He's the one who defines what MAGA is and what it's not. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3438.18s)]
*  What this survey shows is where the American people are. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3441.7s)]
*  And you mentioned the 84 percent. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3444.8199999999997s)]
*  That bipartisan support for this is overwhelming. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3447.06s)]
*  You can't get those numbers anywhere when it comes to those who are Republican. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3450.8999999999996s)]
*  So respondents to the survey who are President Trump's voters, it's approaching 90 percent. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3454.9s)]
*  Hold on now, hold on now, hold on now. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3462.42s)]
*  That's a big number there. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3464.5s)]
*  So almost 90 percent of Republicans want these nuclear weapons taken out. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3466.34s)]
*  And Trump and they, of course, are simpatico on this. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3471.86s)]
*  President Trump is advancing something that his voters overwhelmingly care about. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3478.34s)]
*  It matters to them to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3483.86s)]
*  It's really not a debate within the Republican Party. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3488.02s)]
*  Roger, we got to have you back more often. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3490.82s)]
*  If people want to learn more about the Ronald Reagan Institute in Washington, D.C., where do they go? [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3492.58s)]

*  the Reagan Institute did a massive survey. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3593.62s)]
*  It does it. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3596.8999999999996s)]
*  Every year since 2018, they found that 84% of Americans say no nukes for Iran, period. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3598.98s)]
*  A whopping nearly 90% of Republicans. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3610.02s)]
*  That's MAGA+. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3615.46s)]
*  You understand what I'm saying? [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3616.8999999999996s)]
*  MAGA+. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3618.02s)]
*  I'll show you some more MAGA+. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3619.62s)]
*  This is consistent with CNN polling, and I don't like CNN, but their polling is pretty good. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3621.7s)]
*  And their pollster, this guy's not only entertaining, he's pretty good. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3626.82s)]
*  According to CNN polling, a staggering 83% of Republicans and 79% of Democrats and 79% [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3631.46s)]

*  Got that? [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3659.14s)]
*  Believe it or not, even more than immigration, the American people, according to these [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3662.8999999999996s)]
*  surveys and polls, are absolutely united because Americans are smart. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3667.14s)]
*  And no amount of grifting, no amount of foreign money, [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3672.5s)]
*  no amount of that insanity is going to persuade any rational American. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3677.8599999999997s)]
*  None. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3684.2599999999998s)]
*  We're talking about numbers that are in the stratosphere. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3686.2599999999998s)]
*  Stratosphere. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3688.58s)]

*  Now you see how the Democrats in Congress are way out of sync with their own party. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3698.2599999999998s)]
*  Tim Kaine, that freak, fraud, and phony. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3702.8999999999996s)]
*  They don't support Bernie Sanders and Tlaib and AOC and Omar and Tim Kaine and the rest [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3708.1s)]

*  They don't. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3725.14s)]
*  And Republicans are not supporting the United States. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3728.1s)]
*  And Republicans, almost 90%, say take those nuclear sites out. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3731.86s)]
*  I dare say these isolationists with their platforms and their whatever they have, [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3742.42s)]
*  they're not long for this world if they keep this up and they shouldn't be because they're [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3751.2200000000003s)]

*  They get oxygen from them. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3761.86s)]
*  And so they misread the people of the United States, they misread the president of the United [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3768.6600000000003s)]
*  States if they seek to and want to focus on the isolationists. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3772.42s)]
*  Now these isolationists, their think tank is funded by Soros and Coke. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3781.46s)]
*  Two massively wealthy individuals, neither of whom are conservatives, neither of whom [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3787.54s)]
*  are MAGA. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3796.5s)]
*  Soros we know. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3798.82s)]
*  Soros is a danger to America and his offspring, Alex, even more. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3801.2999999999997s)]
*  Charles Coke and his followers, I call them the Cokeheads, he used to be fairly mainstream, [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3808.82s)]
*  he used to be fairly mainstream, he used to have conservatives and so forth and so on, but he's, [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3813.94s)]
*  he's left the room. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3820.98s)]
*  And so they came together and they formed this thing called the Quincy Institute because they [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3824.66s)]
*  think John Quincy Adams and his viewpoints on foreign policy reflect theirs. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3828.66s)]
*  I can tell you knowing more about John Quincy Adams than those two billionaires. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3834.1s)]
*  John Quincy Adams would never support, never, isolationism and he would never support [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3838.18s)]
*  appeasement of an enemy who has weapons like this. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3843.62s)]

*  You have to be insane. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3851.46s)]
*  You have to be insane. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3856.42s)]

*  And so they try to build these movements on grudges. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3899.7799999999997s)]
*  What they've tried to do here, and I feel I even mentioned it before the president, [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3901.86s)]
*  they've tried to hijack his movement. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3905.14s)]
*  That's never going to happen. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3909.94s)]
*  This movement is built around one of the most charismatic figures in American history. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3911.14s)]
*  Donald Trump defines the movement. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3916.42s)]
*  He almost died for it. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3920.98s)]
*  Not these hangers-on. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3923.14s)]
*  Now I've been explaining this for how long now, Rich? [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3927.7000000000003s)]
*  Five, six weeks? [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3929.86s)]
*  At least. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3931.94s)]
*  At least. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3934.58s)]
*  And I want to welcome all those who are now joining this effort [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3936.98s)]
*  to make sure the American people know the facts and the truth. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3941.7000000000003s)]
*  Who were fearful that they might be targeted by one of these isolationists. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3945.3s)]
*  As I told you weeks and weeks ago, they're paper tigers. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3950.98s)]
*  There's nothing to fear. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3954.9s)]
*  The truth shall set you free. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3956.58s)]
*  Israel's not dragging us into a war. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3960.26s)]
*  Don't follow the anti-Semites. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3963.06s)]
*  Iran is a real threat to the United States of America. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3969.06s)]
*  We've laid out the facts until people are sick of hearing them, I'm sure. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3972.1s)]
*  But the American people are smart. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3978.42s)]
*  They're good. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3980.2599999999998s)]
*  Our reactions are smart and good. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3982.42s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard can show a video of Hiroshima and blame America first. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3987.94s)]
*  That's one thing they all have in common. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3994.5s)]
*  They blame America first. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3996.18s)]
*  Everything's a forever war, but everything is not a forever war. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=3998.1s)]
*  If you don't agree with them, you're a warmonger. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4002.98s)]
*  But we're not warmongers. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4004.98s)]
*  84 percent, excuse me, 90 percent nearly of the American people are not warmongers. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4008.66s)]
*  Nearly 80 percent of the Democrats and the independents, they're not warmongers. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4017.46s)]
*  Americans are not warmongers. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4021.62s)]
*  On the other hand, we're not appeasers either. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4026.42s)]
*  47 years of this is enough. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4032.5s)]
*  It's enough for Israel. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4034.66s)]
*  It's enough for America. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4035.78s)]
*  And the idea that these primitive barbarians from the seventh century [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4037.3s)]
*  should be free to have nuclear weapons, free to get the support of the [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4041.86s)]
*  communist Chinese and fascistic Russia, who they have this love affair with, it's sick. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4047.38s)]
*  Makes no sense to anybody, except the Islamists and the Marxists. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4056.34s)]
*  And they're stupid, quite frankly. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4062.66s)]
*  Sometimes things go to the heads of people who become popular, whether they're on TV [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4069.78s)]
*  or radio, whether they have a huge podcast, a huge subscription service, whatever it is. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4077.3s)]
*  And it goes to their heads. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4088.66s)]
*  They think they're bigger than they are. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4090.1000000000004s)]
*  When I was a kid and first saw my favorite movie, and I've probably seen it now 25, 30, 40 times, [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4096.02s)]
*  Patton. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4103.7s)]
*  I believe it was 1970, Patton. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4105.14s)]
*  And he gives this speech, as you know, George C. Scott at the beginning. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4111.54s)]
*  We have that somewhere, don't we, Mr. Producer, I think? [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4114.34s)]
*  Not to put you on the spot. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4117.06s)]
*  In that one sentence he said has stuck with me since I was 13 years old. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4121.14s)]
*  Glory is fleeting. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4130.820000000001s)]
*  There was a very popular radio host in New York. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4134.5s)]
*  His name was Gene Shepherd. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4137.780000000001s)]
*  He was great. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4139.06s)]
*  He didn't take calls. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4139.860000000001s)]
*  He told stories, spellbinding stories. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4143.14s)]
*  I forget if he was on WR, WABC, doesn't really matter. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4148.18s)]
*  A tremendous radio host. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4153.9400000000005s)]
*  And I used to listen to radio with my little transistor radio from Radio Shack. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4158.5s)]
*  Some of the young folks have no idea what I'm talking about. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4162.42s)]
*  That's okay. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4164.82s)]
*  But I'm teaching you a little bit about your own history. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4165.62s)]
*  They had transistor radios and they had antennas, even the little ones that you would move around [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4168.26s)]
*  in order to try and catch the signal. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4172.02s)]
*  And I try and catch the signal on New York talk radio, which I loved Philadelphia talk radio. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4176.02s)]
*  I love to, but mostly New York. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4180.1s)]
*  And I used to listen to radio with my little transistor radio from Radio Shack on the end [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4183.7s)]
*  of the world, too, but mostly New York. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4189.46s)]
*  That's how Bob Brand and I became fast friends. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4191.46s)]
*  And Gene Shepherd, I remember him saying a number of things, but one thing he said stuck with me, too. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4198.26s)]
*  This is why I take what I do seriously, America. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4203.78s)]
*  Because you never know who you're influencing. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4207.22s)]
*  He said 500 years from now, almost none of us will have existed. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4212.02s)]
*  What did he mean by that? [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4219.46s)]
*  Almost 500 years from now, almost none of us will have existed. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4222.9s)]
*  No, he didn't mean physically. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4226.74s)]
*  He meant in anybody's memory. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4232.1s)]
*  It's the rare person who knows the name of an ancestor from 500 years ago. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4235.94s)]
*  Now we have ancestry people, but it's still a rare person who knows. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4240.58s)]
*  They're flesh and blood from 500 years ago, unless they become incredibly famous for great deeds and for horrific deeds. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4245.06s)]
*  When you think about that, when you think about the opening with George C. Scott, when you think about what Gene Shepherd said, and I'm conveying them to you, [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4259.46s)]
*  you're pretty steady. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4268.58s)]
*  You're pretty steady. These things don't go to your head. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4271.54s)]
*  I'll tell you a little secret. I don't think it's that, out of school. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4278.82s)]
*  Almost every time I talk to the president, not every time, but almost every, and I truly admire this man, and we are friends, [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4283.14s)]
*  he'll say to me, you don't realize [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4291.46s)]
*  how big your voice is. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4296.1s)]
*  You don't realize how big your voice is. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4300.9s)]
*  I said, Mr. President, I don't think about it. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4304.5s)]
*  And he says to me, that's what's endearing about you. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4308.74s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, we all have egos, but I have never let this go to my head ever, ever. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4315.22s)]
*  If you meet me on the street, if you meet me at a diner, if you meet me at a shopping center, at a book signing, [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4323.219999999999s)]
*  people are stunned. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4330.9s)]
*  They say, boy, he's a regular guy. Yes, I'm a regular guy. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4332.9s)]
*  And there's a third thing that caused me to be the way I am. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4336.34s)]
*  When I shake somebody's hand, they take the time to say hello, unless I'm under an enormous rush, and I hope they understand when I say, [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4339.94s)]
*  look, I really want to spend time, but I got to go. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4345.86s)]
*  But that doesn't happen. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4349.0599999999995s)]
*  But that doesn't happen that often. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4351.860000000001s)]
*  My parents, [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4354.900000000001s)]
*  my parents love talk radio. They love this sort of thing. And I think to myself, [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4357.3s)]
*  if they were in line, [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4364.820000000001s)]
*  if they came up to me, came up to somebody at a diner or something, I wouldn't want them treated with respect. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4366.42s)]
*  So just so you know, this stuff doesn't go to my mind, but it has gone to Katarlson's mind. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4372.26s)]
*  It has gone to the minds of these other people. They like being cited by media, either the drudge reporter, this, that, or the other, and so forth. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4376.82s)]
*  They live for it. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4385.3s)]
*  I don't. We'll be right back. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4388.02s)]
*  Pure talk, my wireless company, a veteran-led company, believes every man and woman who has faithfully served this country [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4398.26s)]

*  because [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4504.68s)]
*  he was called out and he's a senator. He's got to get elected and that sort of thing. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4508.76s)]
*  But I would advise others don't waste your time. Just don't waste your time. He needs you more than you need him. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4513.96s)]
*  Let me put it that way. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4518.599999999999s)]
*  Let me put it that way. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4520.12s)]
*  And he stepped on the [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4522.2s)]
*  on the third rail when he decided to attack the President of the United States while the President of the United States is trying to make [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4523.72s)]
*  life and death decisions. You know, that's just unacceptable, period. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4529.16s)]
*  Now the President will probably forgive him because the President is that way. As I said, look at his cabinet. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4533.0s)]
*  Look at his Vice President, his Secretary of State. These are people that said very horrific things about him, [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4539.0s)]
*  but they didn't sabotage him. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4544.280000000001s)]
*  They weren't out [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4548.360000000001s)]
*  particularly at a time like this [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4551.240000000001s)]
*  to weaken his support. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4554.120000000001s)]
*  The only reason Katarelson apologized in my view to the President, I have no insight information. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4556.68s)]
*  He's the one who announced it, [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4561.88s)]
*  is because Katarelson was in trouble. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4563.88s)]
*  But this is how he apparently always is. He's disgruntled. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4568.12s)]
*  Can barely keep a job. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4572.36s)]
*  I don't have any formats he's had, but he's had a lot. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4574.92s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4578.68s)]
*  In the bowels of a hidden bunker somewhere under the brick and steel of a non-district building, [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4591.88s)]
*  we've once again made contact with our leader, [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4597.72s)]
*  Mark Levenne. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4600.92s)]
*  Stick with us folks. We're four or five weeks ahead of the others, not because they aren't good or even great hosts. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4606.28s)]
*  They're just not me. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4612.76s)]
*  Just saying. My experience and so forth. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4615.0s)]
*  I'll give you a perfect example. I'm going to mention something that nobody else has mentioned. I guarantee you, Mr. Perdue. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4618.36s)]
*  One of the people who is watching [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4626.679999999999s)]
*  like a hawk what Donald Trump is doing and I think what we're about to do. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4629.08s)]
*  I have no idea when to make that clear. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4634.599999999999s)]
*  None. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4637.24s)]
*  I think this weekend [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4638.28s)]
*  is when this gets addressed. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4641.639999999999s)]
*  It just can't go on forever. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4644.2s)]
*  Now there is well nor we have enough defensive missiles to keep this up forever. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4646.92s)]
*  What I want to tell you though is this and you'll hear the backbenchers and the plagiarists spew it out probably within minutes. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4653.96s)]
*  Xi is watching this very closely. Have you heard anybody else say that Mr. Perdue? [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4663.96s)]
*  Communist China is watching this very closely because they intend to invade Taiwan. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4669.5599999999995s)]
*  They're not exact parallels, of course. You're talking about a nation that's creating nuclear weapons. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4676.2s)]
*  Has been threatening to attack us. In China we're talking about a nation that has nuclear weapons and hasn't directly threatened us. But nonetheless they're watching. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4682.36s)]
*  They're watching to see if we have the resolve. They're watching to see if the president has the resolve. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4690.679999999999s)]
*  They're watching to see if the American people have the resolve and the answer is yes, yes and yes. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4695.0s)]
*  Yes, yes and yes. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4702.28s)]
*  Yes, yes and yes. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4704.679999999999s)]
*  Just remember Iran is a quasi- [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4707.48s)]
*  Just remember Iran is a quasi-client state. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4712.36s)]
*  A quasi-client state for China and of course Russia. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4716.44s)]
*  But when this is said and done, depending on how it's said and done, [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4722.759999999999s)]
*  China will have received a signal too. So [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4728.36s)]
*  understand what I'm saying. It will be repeated. It'll be repeated here on our favorite TV network. Now, this is the way it works. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4731.0s)]
*  And so when people talk about the ramifications outside [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4739.16s)]
*  of Iran [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4743.5599999999995s)]
*  in Israel, [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4744.919999999999s)]
*  there are ramifications. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4746.36s)]
*  Not that all these Arab countries are going to jump in. They were never going to jump in as I told you five weeks ago. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4748.759999999999s)]
*  Not because this is World War III. I told you this would never be World War III. That these were lies, [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4754.679999999999s)]
*  fear-mongering. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4760.2s)]
*  Not that Israel's dragging us in. I told you Israel's not dragging us in. That we need to take out those nukes for our [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4761.96s)]
*  defense and the American people know this. 90% of Republicans, [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4768.04s)]
*  84% of the American people, almost 80% of Democrats and independents. They know it. We know it. You know it. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4772.740000000001s)]
*  But China will see this [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4782.2s)]
*  and it will have a enormous benefit [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4785.8s)]
*  in the president's dealing with them. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4789.0s)]
*  Not that it will stop them from evading Taiwan, but they're definitely going to have to look a little bit over their shoulder [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4792.679999999999s)]
*  and rethink what they have in mind or at least the way they have it in mind. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4799.88s)]
*  This is a big deal. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4804.84s)]
*  The whole world is watching. The whole world. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4807.72s)]
*  And [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4814.599999999999s)]
*  Don't you know what's amazing about Donald Trump? [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4817.160000000001s)]
*  He didn't take courses in diplomacy. He was never a secretary of state. He was never a senator sitting on the [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4822.280000000001s)]
*  foreign affairs committee. He [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4828.4400000000005s)]
*  probably hasn't read a ton of books on statecraft because he doesn't need to. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4831.4800000000005s)]
*  He's one of the most [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4838.200000000001s)]
*  clever, [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4840.740000000001s)]
*  strategic, [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4844.42s)]
*  and [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4846.76s)]
*  powerful foreign policy presidents in American history because of the nature of this man. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4848.84s)]
*  Look, I'm telling you the truth. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4854.280000000001s)]
*  There's something about him. It's different and for the better. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4857.96s)]
*  Washington can't figure it out, so they attack him. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4862.04s)]
*  They sick the prosecutors on him. They sick the FBI on him. They sick the IRS on him. All of them fail. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4865.4800000000005s)]
*  All of them. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4872.6s)]
*  There's something about this man. He survived [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4875.4800000000005s)]
*  two assassination attempts, but one real attempt that literally grazed his ear and a half [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4879.160000000001s)]
*  half inch difference in trajectory and so forth [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4886.84s)]
*  would have blown the side of his head off. Think about that. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4892.280000000001s)]
*  Think about that. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4897.88s)]
*  Now, I want to disagree with people say the time for peace is running out. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4900.280000000001s)]
*  When this is all said and done, the time for peace hopefully is just beginning. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4905.08s)]
*  The way that the media use language, the way that the isolationists use language, the way some hosts use language and some guests use language [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4911.64s)]
*  is wrong. They have it upside down and inside out. What Israel is doing [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4921.240000000001s)]
*  is to create peace. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4929.4800000000005s)]
*  What the President of the United States is doing and I believe is going to do again, I have no inside information. I want to make that clear. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4932.44s)]
*  I just have my own instincts, my own [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4939.879999999999s)]
*  observations, just my own. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4944.82s)]
*  These are acts of peace destroying nuclear [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4948.839999999999s)]
*  development, nuclear missile sites [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4956.259999999999s)]

*  That's what they are. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4970.76s)]
*  That's what they are. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4974.76s)]
*  This is Israel and the United States [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4978.76s)]
*  defending the world. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=4984.76s)]

*  This little nation [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5079.24s)]
*  demonstrated [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5081.56s)]
*  in how it defeated Hamas effectively, [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5083.0s)]
*  Hezbollah, [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5085.88s)]
*  but even more. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5087.88s)]
*  They've demonstrated that they're not going to be able to do it. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5089.88s)]
*  But even more. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5092.28s)]
*  Less than one week ago, five evenings ago, five [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5094.04s)]
*  evenings ago, took out the higher command [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5098.28s)]
*  of the entire Iranian military. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5101.96s)]
*  Took out nine of all the top nuclear scientists. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5104.84s)]
*  And they're still pounding away and pounding away and pounding away. Those are their jets. Those are their pilots. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5109.24s)]
*  Iran has effectively been defeated. The only question now is [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5114.44s)]
*  what do they decide to do next and what do we decide to do with our military next? [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5120.599999999999s)]
*  Iran was effectively defeated in 48 hours, ladies and gentlemen. You realize that, Mr. Minister? [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5127.719999999999s)]
*  They couldn't defend themselves any longer. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5134.36s)]
*  Sure, they can fire off these ballistic mix. They're encased in the nuclear weapons. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5137.32s)]
*  Sure, they can fire off these ballistic mix. They're incapable of defending their homeland. They have nothing. Nothing's left. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5141.88s)]
*  The Israelis degraded them last October, degraded them last April, [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5148.6s)]
*  and now has [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5154.6s)]
*  blown out entirely their air defense system that was provided them by the Russians. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5155.88s)]
*  In 48 hours, [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5165.56s)]
*  they defeated Iran. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5168.4400000000005s)]
*  48 hours. Again, the question now is whether the regime survives, and I would suggest to the Israelis, don't allow it to survive. Whatever we decide, [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5171.08s)]
*  that ultimately is Israel's decision. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5181.32s)]
*  Now these critics of the president, critics of Israel, they seem to think that they're smarter than Netanyahu and smarter than Donald Trump. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5185.64s)]
*  Do you think they are? [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5192.2s)]
*  Now some of them I should call out by name. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5195.24s)]
*  But I'm not going to do it. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5198.52s)]
*  I'm not going to do it. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5201.64s)]
*  Some of them under these pressures, under these events, weren't sure what to do with themselves, what to say. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5204.84s)]
*  I'm not going to try and embarrass them or humiliate them. Some of them are actually good people. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5211.64s)]
*  One of them I've known a long, long time. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5217.4800000000005s)]
*  He gave a format to Katarlson, [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5221.0s)]
*  which was used [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5224.92s)]
*  to lie about me and so forth and so on. But he himself, I think, was in a bit of a pickle. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5227.08s)]
*  And he himself has never done that. And so I will leave that alone for now, too. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5237.88s)]
*  I'm not about trying to hurt people and so forth and so on, but I am about this country. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5244.76s)]
*  As I have been, those of you who've listened for over two decades, those of you who are newly here, [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5250.76s)]
*  that's what I do every day. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5257.0s)]
*  That's what I write about in these books all the time. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5259.96s)]
*  That's it for me. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5263.56s)]
*  I'll be right back. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5266.04s)]
*  All right, Mr. Producer, I've been promising a little bit of this debate. I don't have the audio in front of me, only because I don't have the print. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5280.04s)]
*  So let's go to the first item. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5291.56s)]
*  Let's take a little listen. We're not going to spend all hour on this, but this is [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5294.28s)]
*  Ted Cruz and Katarlson. Go ahead. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5298.92s)]
*  But I just want to pull that thread because it's so important. I voted for Donald Trump. I campaigned for Donald Trump. He's our president. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5301.88s)]
*  And we're on the cusp of a war. So if Iran, if there's evidence that Iran paid hitmen to kill Donald Trump and is currently doing that, [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5307.719999999999s)]
*  where is that? What do you even talk? I've never heard that before. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5315.0s)]
*  Okay, where is the evidence? Who are these people? Why haven't they been arrested? Why are we not at war with Iran? [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5318.2s)]
*  That's a great question to ask. How do you know that that's true? [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5322.679999999999s)]
*  We know that it's true because we have been told that by [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5327.32s)]
*  the military and our intelligence community for the last two years. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5331.48s)]
*  We meaning who? Congress has in the public. I mean, it had multiple testimonies. I can send you [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5335.56s)]
*  testimonies. Do we know the names of the people or where this happened or what they tried to do to control? [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5341.08s)]
*  Hold on to say this is the game. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5345.400000000001s)]
*  This is the game. Do you know the names of the people? Ladies and gentlemen, go online. There's an entire [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5348.4400000000005s)]
*  charge list that's been brought against these individuals, their names, [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5355.320000000001s)]
*  who they are, where they come from, their connection to the government of Iran. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5359.56s)]
*  It's right there. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5364.6s)]
*  So when you try and put somebody on the spot and say, do you know the names? You know that what does that have to do with anything? [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5367.240000000001s)]
*  I mean, is Katarlson denying that that case exists? Is he denying the information? Where is he getting his information from? [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5375.0s)]
*  His ass? Go ahead. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5382.4400000000005s)]
*  Do not, we have not apprehended an Iranian hitman trying to kill him. We know that Iran is trying to do so. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5384.84s)]
*  In the United States. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5391.320000000001s)]
*  Yes, actually have charged somebody. I believe I'll pull that up and find it. I can't do it during the course of this show. I'll bring it up [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5393.0s)]
*  tomorrow. Go ahead. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5400.12s)]
*  This just seems like a huge headline and you're acting like everyone knows this. I didn't know that. Iran put out a whole video [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5402.2s)]
*  about murdering Trump. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5408.28s)]
*  Right, but I've never heard evidence that there are hitmen in the United States. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5410.68s)]
*  I mean trying to kill Trump right now, we should like have a nationwide. So you see how clever that is in the United States. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5414.92s)]
*  Got that Mr. Bidouka? [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5421.24s)]
*  Got to watch this guy. You know, he's a prep boy, so he thinks he's very clever. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5425.24s)]
*  So you just got to move the facts around a little bit. Go ahead. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5428.92s)]
*  Well, if that's true. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5432.2s)]
*  Don't you think? No. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5433.639999999999s)]
*  If they're trying to assassinate our president. They have been for two years. Then why aren't we at war with them? [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5436.04s)]
*  Well, we are trying to think. Why don't we just nuke Tehran if they're trying to murder our president? [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5441.5599999999995s)]
*  There's nothing that you could do that would be worse for the United States than murdering Trump. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5445.639999999999s)]
*  And I just don't understand why you're not calling for the use of nuclear weapons against the IJOLA right now. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5449.799999999999s)]
*  Oops, I almost got. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5454.599999999999s)]
*  I didn't say [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5457.0s)]
*  the last part of it. Did I misproduce it? [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5458.84s)]
*  Dumbass, I didn't call him an ass. You know what? Why don't we just nuke them? Why don't we do that? That's good. Good idea. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5462.5199999999995s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5468.5199999999995s)]
*  Let's go to the next, the next one. Go ahead. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5471.48s)]
*  If it's true that Iran is trying to murder Trump, we need to move militarily against Iran immediately. That's not isolationism. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5474.68s)]
*  That's the most. So you agree with me, genius. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5480.599999999999s)]
*  Wow, it's good to know. Now he needs proof. That's not hard to find. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5487.4s)]
*  The president himself has mentioned this. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5492.68s)]
*  Anyway, go ahead. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5494.92s)]
*  Which I am calling for. If we believe that Iran is trying to murder our president, we need to strike Iran. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5496.76s)]
*  Okay, but I say things like, well, then just nuke them, which is what you just said, which is kind of a weird. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5501.5599999999995s)]
*  Because I'm upset. It is weird. I'm taking you seriously. You don't take your own statements seriously. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5505.879999999999s)]
*  I take my statements very seriously. So I've asked you where's the evidence this is true? [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5510.759999999999s)]
*  And you said, well, they're trying to assassinate Brian Hook or something, which I'm against, by the way. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5514.12s)]
*  And I'm against hurting any American, period, no matter. So you dispute that they're trying to murder. I'm not disputing it at all. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5518.2s)]
*  I'm not disputing it at all. I mean, they literally arrested the hitman with Bolton. I don't know why [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5523.24s)]
*  that's even relevant. I'm asking about the president of the United States. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5527.4s)]
*  It's not relevant that Iran hired hitmen to murder cabinet members in Trump's administration. That doesn't go to [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5530.360000000001s)]
*  I've already said that they're willing to spend money to do that. I'm fully opposed to that. It's awful. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5536.52s)]
*  I am against killing anybody, actually, especially foreign government. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5542.76s)]
*  I'm asking about your allegation and the prime minister of Israel's allegation that [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5547.8s)]
*  is that Iran is trying to murder the president. Killing terrorists is a good thing. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5552.6s)]
*  Killing people who are trying to murder Americans is a good thing because if you're America first, [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5557.16s)]
*  you want to protect America. And so taking out killing Osama bin Laden was a fantastic day for the world. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5562.12s)]
*  But you don't really believe that they're trying to murder Trump or you? [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5567.64s)]
*  Yes, I do. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5569.72s)]
*  Let's see what comes up. I'm typing this in right now. Bear with me, America. Hold on here. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5573.4s)]
*  You already have it, three people. All right. I mean, it's so obvious. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5581.96s)]
*  I don't even know why this is a subject that Katarosin feels necessary to debate. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5589.32s)]
*  You already sent it, Richie? All right, he's pulling it together. Let's take a break now. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5595.72s)]
*  We'll be right back. Oh, I have a minute and a half left. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5602.12s)]
*  All right, I have a minute and a half left, but we'll pull it up. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5605.8s)]
*  All right, I have a minute and a half left, but we'll pull it up. Now, [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5608.84s)]
*  you can pull it up too, folks. It just shows you the numbskull-like focus of this debate. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5612.04s)]
*  Do you have evidence? Do you have evidence? Do you have evidence that there was actually an [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5621.08s)]
*  assassination? No, we made it up. We made it up. We made up the Hunter Biden laptop. We make up [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5625.32s)]
*  everything. And it's just like a Tulsi Gabbard part of the cabal, in my humble opinion. And she's [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5630.2s)]
*  that we don't have any evidence that the Iranians are still working. You know, [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5636.68s)]
*  they're moving ahead. CNN ran with this. It could be as far as three years away. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5640.84s)]
*  Does it look like to you, America, that as far as three years away? [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5644.84s)]
*  No, it's not three years away. You can ask real generals, real experts who have to deal with this [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5651.0s)]
*  every day in that region of the world, and they'll tell you. Look at the IAEA report. Now, why is that [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5656.92s)]
*  important? Because it's part of the UN. The UN hates Israel. The UN hates America. And they put [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5662.28s)]
*  this out. It was persuasive to America, was persuasive to Europe. They all signed off to hold [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5668.28s)]
*  Iran, to hold Iran. I don't know what they're planning to do to sanction Iran. It's kind of [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5674.759999999999s)]
*  Israel that's sanctioning Iran. And it gives chapter and verse on everything that Iran is doing, [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5680.599999999999s)]
*  everything that they're trying to hide, what they have found despite efforts by Iran to hide it. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5686.759999999999s)]
*  And it is overwhelming. It is massive. And this chucklehead still believes there's no evidence of [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5691.88s)]
*  that. Our DNI director said there was no evidence of it either. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5699.56s)]
*  The new American revolution starts here. The Mark Levenshaw call in at 877-381-3811. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5708.84s)]
*  There were individuals charged, a murder for hire and related charges. I'm reading from a press [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5719.96s)]
*  release by the Department of Justice against IRGC asset and two local operatives. FBI director Chris [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5727.32s)]
*  Ferre said the charges announced today expose Iran's continued brazen attempts to target US [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5735.64s)]
*  citizens, including President-elect Donald J. Trump, other government leaders and dissidents who [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5740.6s)]
*  criticize the regime in Tehran. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a designated foreign [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5746.36s)]
*  terrorist organization, has been conspiring with criminals and hitmen to target and gun down [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5753.5599999999995s)]
*  Americans on US soil. And that simply won't be tolerated thanks to the hard work of the FBI. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5758.5199999999995s)]
*  Deadly schemes were disrupted. We're committed to using the full resources of the FBI to protect [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5764.12s)]
*  our citizens from Iran or any other adversary who targets Americans. Now this is from last November. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5769.24s)]
*  So obviously the case hasn't gone to court yet. The defense has time to make its [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5776.92s)]
*  case and so forth and so on. So I guess Katarlson up there in Maine, does he not have access to a [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5781.639999999999s)]
*  computer, Mr. Reducer? I would think so. This is from ABC News. November 8th, three charged [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5789.08s)]
*  in Iran link murder plots with one targeting Donald Trump as revenge for killing Qasem Salamani, [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5798.679999999999s)]
*  Department of Justice. Three people have been charged with in a series of alleged [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5803.88s)]
*  Iran link murder plots with one of them accused of trying to assassinate President Donald Trump, [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5808.76s)]
*  President-elect Donald Trump, others talking in Iranian American activists and two Jewish [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5813.08s)]
*  Americans living in New York according to a criminal complaint unsealed Friday in New York. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5817.88s)]
*  And it goes on. And there are multiple other articles and information related to these [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5822.92s)]
*  assassination attempts. One person was assassinated. In fact, the IRGC also tasked [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5827.8s)]
*  Shaqiri, the head of this, with carrying out other assassinations against U.S. and Israeli [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5835.96s)]
*  citizens located in the United States, including Trump, the complaint alleges. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5841.0s)]
*  Now this is the Biden Justice Department. This is Merrick Garland. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5846.68s)]
*  Now what else was it that Katarlson needs for evidence that the Iranian regime [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5851.320000000001s)]
*  sought to assassinate Donald Trump? What else does he want? [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5856.2s)]
*  What else does he want that there was evidence of nuclear, of them building nuclear weapons? [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5863.16s)]
*  I mean, what is this, ladies and gentlemen? This is just insanity, insanity. Folks, stop wasting [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5868.5199999999995s)]
*  time debating this guy. If you want to debate him, stop waiting, wasting time recognizing him. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5875.88s)]
*  Stop wasting time following him. He's a freak, a fraud and a phony, in my humble opinion. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5882.44s)]
*  And it's very interesting. This website media is very much in Katarlson's corner and it's [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5893.08s)]
*  run by Dan Abrams. It's a left-wing website. Most of the people are very passionately supportive of [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5898.28s)]
*  the Democrats. They spend an enormous amount of time trying to smear Donald Trump and Fox and me [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5904.839999999999s)]
*  and others. But they love Katarlson. Why? Same thing, grifters. Grifters. How many clicks can they get? [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5910.68s)]
*  How many clicks can they get? They're not news operations. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5924.280000000001s)]
*  They also stated that he was tasked with surveilling two Jewish American citizens residing [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5930.4400000000005s)]
*  in New York City, was offered half a million dollars by the Iranian Republican Guard official [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5934.84s)]
*  for the murder of either victim according to the complaint. He was also tasked with targeting Israeli [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5939.72s)]
*  tourists in Sri Lanka and it goes on and on and on. Actors directed by the government of Iran continue [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5944.6s)]
*  to target our citizens, including President-elect Trump on U.S. soil and abroad. This has to stop, [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5949.96s)]
*  said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams, appointed by Biden. Today's charges are another message to those [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5955.56s)]
*  who continue in their efforts. We will remain unrelenting and so forth and so on. So is there [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5961.72s)]
*  still any doubt? Just because Katarlson lives in his own world, it's an amazing thing. He's [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5966.2s)]
*  instinctively denying what these Islamist terrorists are capable of and doing. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5974.12s)]
*  Maybe the next time he interviews the monarchical inbred that runs Katar, he can ask him about [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5982.36s)]
*  things like this. Maybe the next time he interviews that guy, he can ask him about [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5987.72s)]
*  9-11 and why they protected KSM so that he could attack our country a year or two later. Why did [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5992.28s)]
*  they give him a fake passport? Why did they give him money? Why did they give him an apartment? [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=5999.16s)]
*  Maybe he can ask him that in one of his tough questions next time. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6003.32s)]
*  I've had enough of all this and I hope you have too. This is just, you know, [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6010.12s)]
*  there's too many things going on that are gravely important to the survival of this nation. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6014.84s)]
*  Gravely important. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6022.679999999999s)]
*  And so I just felt when he threw down the hammer, [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6026.5199999999995s)]
*  there was time to engage and expose. Engage him and expose him. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6031.88s)]
*  It is what it is. Very important, I think. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6040.2s)]
*  Let's see here. Hold on one second. Still looking at this. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6044.44s)]
*  We have here the Department of Justice announces murder for hire and related charges against the [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6050.759999999999s)]
*  IRGC asset and two local operatives. It goes on again. And they mentioned Donald Trump. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6055.879999999999s)]
*  So there you go. So now what's his excuse? [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6066.04s)]
*  I didn't say plotting. I said attempted. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6070.2s)]
*  Okay, good for you. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6075.64s)]
*  Let's take some calls. Shall we, Mr. Producer? I think we shall. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6079.56s)]
*  All right, let's see. Let's go to Michael Williston, North Dakota on the Mark Levin app. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6085.16s)]
*  Michael, how are you? So, Michael, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6091.16s)]
*  I'm doing really good today. Mark, how are you today? Very well. Thank you. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6096.2s)]
*  Good. Good. Hey, you are an amazing man for what you do. Thank you for standing with our country [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6107.639999999999s)]
*  and for Israel. I recently just got back from Israel four weeks ago with a group from our church. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6114.76s)]
*  And we started going there 12 years ago on tours. And God had always put it on my heart [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6122.92s)]
*  to help the Jewish and Israeli people. So we've been going over along the Gaza border, [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6131.64s)]
*  working at the kibbutz, cleaning up, planting trees. More importantly, just showing the Israeli [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6139.72s)]
*  Jewish people that we love them, that we care for them, and that they matter. Yes, it matters. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6149.4s)]
*  And it's very vitally important. It does matter. It's very vitally important that everyone [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6156.679999999999s)]
*  gets involved. We named our ministry Genesis 12-3, where God says, [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6165.08s)]
*  those who bless Israel will be blessed and those who curse will be cursed. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6170.679999999999s)]
*  At the end of the month, I will be joining you in Washington, D.C. for the Kufi Summit. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6174.84s)]
*  Oh, that's going to be fantastic. Make sure you come up to me and remind me [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6181.96s)]
*  that you made your call. OK, I very much appreciate it. God bless you, my friend. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6186.52s)]
*  Let's go to Rick Kingsley, Pennsylvania, the great WTRW. Rick, how are you, sir? [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6192.28s)]
*  I'm great, Mr. Levin, and thank you for taking my call. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6197.639999999999s)]
*  My pleasure. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6202.12s)]
*  I won't be shedding any tears for the Supreme Leader in Iran if he gets whacked. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6204.44s)]
*  And that's because we have, there was five servicemen from my area that got whacked in Iraq [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6211.16s)]
*  with an IED. And so I'm sure my community, there won't be any hard feelings for that. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6218.839999999999s)]
*  Are you in central Pennsylvania? [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6229.16s)]
*  I am in northeastern Pennsylvania. Yeah, we bordered New York State. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6231.799999999999s)]
*  So it's a rural area, obviously. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6239.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6242.04s)]
*  And you lost five of your citizens. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6242.84s)]
*  These IEDs were manufactured by Iran under the oversight of Soleimani. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6247.08s)]
*  Donald Trump took out Soleimani. And are you aware that Chatsworth Katarelson criticized him? [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6254.76s)]
*  Are you aware that Rand Paul criticized him? The same crowd because they said it would lead [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6261.16s)]
*  to a broader war? This is what I'm talking about. This is utterly irresponsible propaganda by these [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6266.28s)]
*  people. And I'm very, very sorry to hear this. Very, very sorry to hear it, Rick. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6272.28s)]
*  Thank you for your call, and God bless you, my friend. Yep. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6276.84s)]
*  Let's go to Julie, Santa Monica, California. As you can see, we're going all across the country [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6282.04s)]
*  here. Julie, on the Mark Levin app, how are you? [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6286.36s)]
*  I'm wonderful, Mark. Nice to speak with you. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6290.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6293.48s)]
*  I was thinking there's a reason that Israel has the best air defense systems in the world. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6296.2s)]
*  The Iron Dome, David Slane, Beryl 2 and 3, and now the Barack Magen, [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6301.88s)]
*  is because their purpose in the world is to have life and improve life. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6308.12s)]
*  They could have the most, well, they do, destructive weapons, but they did not put all [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6316.2s)]
*  their technology to destroying their enemies. I just want to put a fine point on that. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6321.08s)]
*  There have been reports that they have multiple nuclear weapons and they haven't used one of them [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6329.4s)]
*  and they haven't even considered using one. And nobody even talks about it because they know what [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6333.4s)]
*  Julie's point is. This is a country that wants to live and wants other people to live, but they [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6338.76s)]
*  cannot tolerate what's being done to them. And yet they have an arsenal that they haven't used. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6343.0s)]
*  Isn't that your point? [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6348.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. That they have all the power in the world. If it were our country, [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6351.16s)]
*  being bombarded by missiles by our neighbors, we'd pulverize them in one second. And Israel [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6356.76s)]
*  is vocation. They say, please stop bombing us. And they just put up these defensive shields. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6363.0s)]
*  And they have a term for this in Israel, chikkun olam. And that means repair the world. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6369.24s)]
*  And that is Israel's national purpose. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6377.72s)]
*  Well, Julie, you're a lovely lady. You made a superb point. I'm going to have to go. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6381.56s)]

*  Mark Levin. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6446.6s)]
*  All right. Let's see here. How much time do I have, Rich? [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6459.64s)]

*  I'm doing my best. Okay, let's go to Jim Jacksonville, Florida, listening on WSKY. How are you? [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6468.6s)]
*  I'm fine. Thank you, Mark. Hey, I'm trying to resolve this US strike on Iran's nuclear bunkers. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6478.76s)]
*  How about if we sell and support arms across the world, which we do. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6488.92s)]
*  So in that vein, we could sell the Moab's to Israel. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6495.96s)]
*  No, but you need the bombers. It's not just the bomb. It's the bombers. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6503.48s)]
*  And these are very sophisticated systems and I don't think we're selling them to anybody. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6508.76s)]
*  So you need certain types of equipment. You need certain types of [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6515.64s)]
*  bombers where this equipment is installed in order to drop this bomb. Otherwise, I'm sure they would [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6521.4800000000005s)]
*  have, but that's the problem. And the Israelis are not trained in flying these bombers. Very few of [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6527.4800000000005s)]
*  our pilots are trained in flying these bombers. And so either we use them and drop these bombs or [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6533.56s)]
*  they don't get dropped. Thank you for your call, brother. Great call. Let's keep going. Let's go to [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6541.0s)]

*  Mark, how are you? It's an honor to talk to you. Thank you. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6554.2s)]
*  I'm not going to listen to your wife, Julie, your beautiful children. I just wanted to make sure [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6559.0s)]
*  that I have to say that this, uh, Charlton has gone crazy. It's gone crazy. The guy's a bit of [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6563.88s)]
*  a whack job. I used to like the guy, but no more. Now you live in Dublin. Are you a citizen of Ireland? [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6572.52s)]
*  Yes, sir. So you used to watch them in Ireland, but not now. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6580.68s)]
*  No, no, I don't watch them. I used to. No, I don't. I don't pay attention to that. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6585.160000000001s)]
*  What's happened to the government of Ireland? My God, they hate the country of Israel. What's that [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6593.4800000000005s)]
*  all about? I know. I was just going to say, I was on to that 10 years ago, got my media [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6597.72s)]
*  and, um, you know what? They've gotten worse. Ray, do me a favor, call back tomorrow. I'm literally [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6603.88s)]
*  out of time. You know, McGregor, you're a great UFC fighter. He's very pro-Israel and he despises [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6610.68s)]
*  the government over there, but give us a call tomorrow. I'd love to talk to you. We salute our [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6616.12s)]
*  armed forces, police officers, firefighters, emergency personnel, our truckers, the men and [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6620.280000000001s)]
*  women in Ukraine, the men and women in Israel, and of course you, the great American people, [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6624.28s)]
*  and Mr. President, you don't need to meet with the Iranians. Time is up. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5eKB0xBAo&t=6628.679999999999s)]
