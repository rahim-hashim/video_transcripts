Video Description: On Thursday’s Mark Levin Show, the Senate parliamentarian is blocking Medicaid changes to waste, fraud, and abuse in the big, beautiful bill. House Republicans proposed tightening Medicaid eligibility with work requirements and restrictions on illegal aliens, but the Senate parliamentarian deemed these changes outside budget reconciliation, exposing the bill to a filibuster. The Senate’s decision not to challenge this ruling perpetuates Medicaid misuse. Additionally, the Senate opposes raising the $10,000 cap on home mortgage interest and property tax deductions, disproportionately affecting taxpayers in high-tax blue states. We need to maximize tax deductions for individuals no matter if they live in a blue or a red state. Presidents Reagan and Trump’s tax policies fueled economic growth. Also, Zohran Mamdani, a New York City mayoral candidate, is a dangerous Marxist Islamist with ties to anti-Semitic and anti-Israel activities. Mamdani’s proposals, including city-owned grocery stores, massive tax increases, and refusing to cooperate with ICE, are policies that could drive out productive residents, attract welfare-seekers, Islamists, and Marxists, and lead to economic disaster for New York City. If Mamdani gets elected you will see authoritarian democracy in NYC. Authoritarian democracies mimic authoritarian regimes, using seemingly legitimate legal processes—such as passing tyrannical laws or disregarding due process—to justify power, prioritizing legality over justice or morality. Later, John Catsimatidis, owner of Red Apple Media and grocery chains Gristedes and D’Agostino Supermarkets, calls in to warn that he'll close his grocery stores if Mamdani wins the NYC mayor race. Catsimatidis explains that Mamdani’s policies, including massive tax increases and defunding the police, would drive businesses out and harm the city’s economy.  In addition, capitalism drives innovation and improves quality of life by creating wealth through valuable goods and services, such as grocery store chains offering affordable, diverse food options. In contrast, Marxism destroys societies without producing tangible benefits. Capitalism underpins everyday conveniences—clean water, electricity, advanced healthcare, and mobility—unmatched globally. Marxist and socialist ideologies promise unattainable utopias while overlooking capitalism’s capacity to foster equality through social mobility, enabling anyone to rise from poverty to wealth. Finally, Johnny Joey Jones calls in to discuss his new book, Behind the Badge – Answering The Call To Serve on America’s Homefront.

# The Real Enemy Within: Marxism and Islamism in America
**The Mark Levin Show:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0)
*  Ladies and gentlemen, this next segment of the podcast is brought to you by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=0.0s)]
*  For over 50 years, the Great Heritage Foundation has been America's outpost in Washington, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4.8s)]
*  fighting against the D.C. federal bureaucracy and working to secure a future that allows Americans [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=9.52s)]
*  to live the good life. For too long, common sense principles have been ignored by many of the very [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=14.64s)]
*  leaders claiming to fight for America, but the Heritage Foundation is proud to hold our leaders [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=19.28s)]
*  accountable and stand up for America's founding principles, paid for by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=23.6s)]
*  He's here. Now, broadcasting from the underground command post, deep in the bowels of a hidden [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=30.48s)]
*  bunker, somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=38.0s)]
*  we once again make contact with our leader, Mark LeVein. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  Hello America, Mark LeVein here, our number 877-381-3811, 877-381-3811, lots to get to. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=120.88s)]
*  By the way, on this great big bill, I could be wrong. If the Senate's making it look better, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=133.12s)]
*  I'd like to know how. The House, Republicans, to their great credit, they looked at Medicaid, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=141.12s)]
*  they saw legal aliens were getting Medicaid, they wanted to tighten it up. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=148.64s)]
*  They see that individuals who are sound of mind and body, who won't work at least 20 hours a week, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=152.48s)]
*  were getting Medicaid, which is a welfare program. So they wanted to fix that and have a stronger [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=159.27999999999997s)]
*  work requirement in there and a couple things like that. So the Senate parliamentarian, who is a [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=166.23999999999998s)]
*  bureaucrat, has apparently ruled that that's not part of a budget process, that's more policy [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=170.72s)]
*  oriented and therefore does not fit within the reconciliation process. Now what's all that jargon [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  mean? What it means is, if you put it in the bill, the bill is subject to a filibuster, as opposed to [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  just a majority. And we know what the Democrats would do with it. So Senator Thune, as I read [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=189.76s)]
*  the various press reports, has said that he will not overturn the parliamentarian's decision. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=196.4s)]
*  So now if this bill passes, it means that all this fraud and waste that's going to individuals who [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=202.88s)]
*  shouldn't get it under Medicaid, they'll get it. Okay? I'm cutting to the chase. No Washington, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=208.56s)]
*  D.C. jargon. Number two, I guess some of the minority on this with some people, I don't think [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=213.6s)]
*  with you, but I think inside Washington, these deductions for home mortgage interest [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=220.32s)]
*  and property taxes, there used to be no cap on that, none whatsoever. None. But then they put a [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  $10,000 cap on it because their view is, well, that'll cover most people. And so the Republicans [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  went back and quite frankly, some of the Republicans from Northeastern states where taxes [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=244.72s)]
*  are ridiculous, they got it to go up. I think it was to $40,000. Now, that doesn't mean most [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=250.4s)]
*  of you need a $40,000 tax deduction, but this isn't just about Frank over there and Sally over [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=257.28s)]
*  there and Hakeem over there and so forth and so on. It's what's best for the country. My attitude [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=263.44s)]
*  is always, if you can keep more of your money, you earned it. You earned it and you should keep [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=269.28s)]
*  as much as possible. This is Ron DeSantis's view here in Florida, where there's no income tax. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=274.32s)]
*  All taxes are low except for these property taxes and the state has nothing to do with it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=280.15999999999997s)]
*  It's the selfish, damnable counties paying off teachers unions and everything else. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=284.48s)]
*  So the property taxes are fairly high in Florida and the state has no direct control over it. So [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=291.2s)]
*  he wants to address that. Well, in a lot of states, a lot of you Republicans live in blue [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=299.28s)]
*  or purple states and your property taxes are significant. And so it seems the position of [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=305.12s)]
*  the Senate Republicans and they're not the only ones is screw you. You live in a blue state. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=310.8s)]
*  They have to lower the property taxes. Otherwise you're going to suffer. No, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=315.59999999999997s)]
*  that's not the way it's supposed to work. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=320.64s)]
*  At the federal level, we're talking about taxes. We should be able to keep as much as we can, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=322.32s)]
*  whatever the state property taxes are. It's not about rewarding this state or that state. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=332.0s)]
*  If you have mega people living in New York, living in California, living in Illinois, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=339.36s)]
*  you know, they don't, we don't all live in one little neighborhood. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=345.6s)]
*  They should be able to have as much of a tax deduction as possible as anybody else. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=349.35999999999996s)]
*  No, but we're going to punish the blue state. What do you mean punish? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=354.88s)]
*  You're talking about individual citizens. It's their money. It's your money. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=359.35999999999996s)]
*  That's my view. I remember when Regulus president, we had massive slash of taxes across the board. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=364.96s)]
*  You know what we had? He got rid of the inheritance tax [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=371.91999999999996s)]
*  tax. Because you've already paid taxes on that money. And so it was zero, zero, not today. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=374.48s)]
*  And then when it came to interest deductions or property tax reductions, there was no cap. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=386.32s)]
*  No cap on that. No inheritance tax. And you know what happened, ladies and gentlemen, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=392.56s)]
*  massive economic growth. For the years that Donald Trump was president, our economy grew by [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=399.12s)]
*  almost one third. The entire damn economy grew by almost one third because of his tax program. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=406.0s)]
*  So the Republicans are acting like kind of rhinos. Well, the Senate says we're not going [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=416.71999999999997s)]
*  to go along with this house thing of $40,000 deduction. We're going to go back to 10. Why? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=423.44s)]
*  Well, we don't want to benefit these these blue states. We never even had those arguments during [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=431.84s)]
*  the Reagan administration. It wasn't a matter of blue states, red states, purple states, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=437.36s)]
*  polka dot states. It was a matter of the individual taxpayer. They're the ones who pay the taxes, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=442.96s)]
*  not the state government of New York and California and Illinois and Rhode Island. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=449.44s)]
*  A real human being with a family, you pay the taxes. So I have a strong disagreement with the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=454.08s)]
*  Senate on this. And a strong disagreement with the majority leader, Thune. He should override [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=461.52s)]
*  the parliamentarian. We didn't vote for the parliamentarian. You got a program that's full [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=469.76s)]
*  of bloat and fraud with illegal aliens and people who can work able bodied, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=475.84s)]
*  able mind people who won't work. And you're paying their health care. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=482.56s)]
*  So the parliamentarian says who gives a damn what the parliamentarian says. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=489.52s)]
*  Who cares what the janitor says? I don't care that there's anything wrong with them. It doesn't matter. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=495.52s)]
*  Crazy, crazy. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=500.64s)]
*  All right, you got this this Marxist Islamist and he is he is a dangerous man. The Zoran [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=508.4s)]
*  Mamdani. He started his chapter of students for justice in Palestine. That is a Hamas terrorist [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=515.12s)]
*  front group. And they have hundreds of these these entities on our college campuses. They are here to [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=523.84s)]
*  overthrow the country. It's a big supporter of BDS. BDS is an anti-Semitic anti-Israel program [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=529.28s)]
*  worldwide where the anti-Semites get together and they want to destroy the economy of Israel by [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=538.16s)]
*  refusing to do business with them. We actually have liberal Republican Democrats like Chuck Schumer, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=542.72s)]
*  like Jerry Nadler, and they're not alone and many of them who've now endorsed this guy. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=553.1999999999999s)]
*  Who've now endorsed this guy, as my wife said. Why? Because the religion is the Democrat Party. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=560.0s)]
*  Frankly, we Jews are stuck with people like this and we have been for a long, long time. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=569.8399999999999s)]
*  We really have. Self-haters, self-promoters. Every faith, by the way, every ethnicity, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=577.12s)]
*  every background, it's the same damn thing. But I'm speaking to all my people and how [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=584.24s)]
*  infuriating it is. I have nothing in common with Schumer and Nadler. Nothing. Nothing. Zero. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=589.52s)]
*  And they're willing to back somebody like this? Back somebody like this? Guy wants to start [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=597.2s)]
*  city-owned grocery stores and we're going to talk about that next hour. He wants massive tax [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=605.28s)]
*  increases for business. He will not allow ice in his city, even though that is [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=612.24s)]
*  not under his control, but that means he won't let the cops help work with ice. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=619.28s)]
*  So you're going to have productive people, people who are long-time New Yorkers, leave the city, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=626.48s)]
*  and you're going to have people come into the city who want welfare, who want freebies. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=631.84s)]
*  You're going to have Islamists come in. I don't mean Muslims. I said Islamists. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=636.16s)]
*  Of course, you'll have more Marxists come in and you're going to have a disaster on your hands. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=640.4s)]
*  The biggest city, the financial center of America. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=645.52s)]
*  The city that was ground zero in 1775 for the Revolutionary War. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=654.72s)]
*  The tax revolt. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=665.12s)]
*  So we're going to take a very short break and I want to read something to you that's very important. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=666.32s)]
*  Very important. We'll be right back. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=670.88s)]
*  Mark LeBen. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=672.48s)]
*  President Trump is in Washington with a mandate from the American people to solve the border [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=680.1600000000001s)]

*  judges across our country have consistently been blocking President Trump's attempts to fulfill his [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=690.9599999999999s)]
*  mandate. The Heritage Foundation has been analyzing the situation and they've been able to identify [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=695.8399999999999s)]

*  Before I read to you what I want to read to you, which I think is very important after the bottom [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=751.68s)]
*  of the hour, I want us to regroup and think about something. Today is June 26th. June 26th. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=755.36s)]
*  On June 4th, I met with the President of the United States at his request. On June 5th, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=768.4s)]
*  it was leaked. On June 5th, I was attacked for trying to get the United States to go to war. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=773.68s)]
*  A couple days after I met with the President, and I don't link the two, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=786.8s)]
*  the 60 days that he gave Iran to negotiate and basically surrender, passed the day 61. The Israeli [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=790.16s)]
*  struck. They struck. I believe it was two, three days later. We had a whole, relatively small, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=798.4799999999999s)]
*  but a whole group of people who accused me of helping to start that war by convincing Donald Trump [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=812.08s)]

*  The President of the United States, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=831.84s)]
*  the Vice President of the United States, 94% of Republican MAGA support what took place, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=835.9200000000001s)]
*  right, Mr. Medusa? Support. Support what the Israelis did and then later supported what [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=843.0400000000001s)]

*  It was inevitable. There was no choice. It's that simple. Despite all the, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=876.1600000000001s)]

*  And we knew at some point beyond that we had to drop those bombs. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=896.24s)]
*  The President obviously knew as did his entire administration. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=904.72s)]

*  Dead wrong. 94% of Republican MAGA. The media have been writing ever since about this divide [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=923.84s)]
*  in MAGA. There is no divide in MAGA. 94% to 6%, that's not a divide. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=933.28s)]
*  But they keep promoting it and they promote these people. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=942.3199999999999s)]
*  Although that will stop just a matter of time because they're humiliating themselves. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=947.2s)]
*  Because they want there to be a divide. If the Israelis had an act and we had an act [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=951.76s)]
*  to take out those sites, we'd pay a price your kids and your grandkids would. It'd be a horrendous [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=958.56s)]

*  Now there's a ceasefire. I don't know of any ceasefire that's ever last forever. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=971.68s)]

*  in his policies, which are great. Negotiate, try and get the deal, try to hammer it down and so [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=987.28s)]
*  forth and so on. It's the enemy that's the problem. Not the president, not the Israelis, not me, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=993.28s)]
*  not you. Even now they won't say they'll surrender their nuclear program. Even now they say they won't [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=998.96s)]

*  talking about this. General Kaine has talked about it. It's a serious matter and the president will [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1016.96s)]
*  talk about it and have to confront it and deal with it. And I wouldn't want anyone else to do [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1022.24s)]

*  I just want to remind you [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1046.32s)]
*  in this battle here at home, which does affect policy, you won, we won, the president won, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1050.0s)]

*  to hit the sites. I see unity among conservatives and Republicans and MAGA like I haven't seen [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1072.8799999999999s)]

*  Democracy doesn't ensure liberty, doesn't ensure property rights, it doesn't ensure security. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1368.5600000000002s)]
*  Democracy is a system by which you choose individuals in a government. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1374.56s)]
*  That process does not ensure [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1383.4399999999998s)]

*  we have democracy, we get to vote. Really? [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1405.6s)]

*  In the book, I coined these words because I think they're important. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1417.28s)]
*  What is it? [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1422.3999999999999s)]
*  Negative power need not be exercised or present itself in such aggressive forms. For modern [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1422.96s)]
*  Western societies, most of which are said to be advanced, enlightened, and democratic, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1428.0s)]

*  In one word, we'll get into this in a couple of weeks, it's coercion. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1440.96s)]
*  It's the centralization of power in a few and fewer individuals. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1446.88s)]
*  It's the centralization of power in a few and fewer individuals. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1450.08s)]
*  Typically, Western institutions have been established gradually by experience and practice [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1454.48s)]
*  or constituted by design to counter or limit the most aggressive forms of negative power, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1459.6s)]
*  such as dictatorships and oligarchies. However, over time, they tend to become [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1465.04s)]

*  negative power. I call this authoritarian democracy. If this guy gets elected, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1544.08s)]
*  you're going to see it in spades in New York City. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1550.32s)]
*  Authoritarian democracy is when a democracy begins to slide into a form of authoritarianism, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1552.24s)]
*  not all at once, but steadily, where authoritarian attributes slowly proliferate, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1559.92s)]
*  and one branch of the democracy begins to envelop the others, and where all branches coalesce into [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1565.36s)]
*  one. Either way, the exercise of power is steadily centralized and the citizenry increasingly [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1570.72s)]
*  peripheral. It typically results in the rule by the unelected governmental branches, [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1577.2s)]
*  but can also mutate into excessive executive or legislative empowerment. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1583.28s)]
*  Does this sound about right, Mr. Producer, about what's going on in New York City? [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1590.8s)]
*  Authoritarian democracies adopt the, excuse me, adopt and use the tactics of authoritarian regimes, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1596.72s)]
*  albeit at first with more of a glove than an iron fist, but the underlying attributes are there. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1603.2s)]
*  For example, legislatures that pass tyrannical laws, but which laws are said to be legitimate [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1610.0s)]
*  simply because the legislature adopted them. Courts that disregard due process, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1615.76s)]
*  but which trials are said to do justice because they were held in a court of law with defense, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1620.72s)]
*  counsel, and juries present, and so forth. The use of law is said to be a legitimate application [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1626.0s)]
*  of power because it is the law, not because it is proper, just, or moral law. Even today, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1632.16s)]
*  the impact of authoritarian democracy has seeped into our society's psyche so successfully [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1641.0400000000002s)]
*  that the late Austrian-American economist Ludwig von Mises observed that one of the worst tyrannies [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1647.44s)]
*  of all, Marxism, has become part of the West's psyche. Is that not the case right now in New York City? [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1654.16s)]
*  He said to a considerable extent, without knowing it, many people are philosophical Marxists, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1663.0400000000002s)]
*  although they use different names for their philosophical ideas. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1668.88s)]
*  And I go on. However, there are also those, perhaps many, who benefit from the government's [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1673.68s)]
*  use of soft negative power, ready? Including when that power is used, for example, to forcibly [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1680.16s)]
*  redistribute the wealth and property of those who produced and earned it, for the use and [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1686.24s)]
*  enrichment of others, beyond the usual and basic needs of a civil society, and justify what would [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1692.16s)]
*  otherwise be considered thievery as noble and even moral. And there he is, the Marxist, the Marxist [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1698.64s)]
*  Islamist, Zoran Mamdani. Massive tax increases, massive redistribution of wealth. And of course, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1705.36s)]
*  people are going to support it, because they benefit from it. But what is not discussed, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1715.44s)]
*  not even a little, except by me and in this book, is the liberty is the governing construct that [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1721.52s)]
*  you are going to lose as a result, and ultimately the tyranny, the poverty, the impoverishment, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1728.24s)]
*  the results. The beneficiaries of such soft negative power are fully aware that they did not [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1733.68s)]
*  earn what they have received, but delude themselves in various ways that they are deserving it. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1740.72s)]
*  Democrats have this, excuse me, democracies have the seeds of their own destruction within them. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1748.88s)]
*  Folks, this is two and a half pages. I'm explaining what's going on in New York before [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1755.5200000000002s)]
*  what was taking place in New York, not because I'm Nostradamus, but because I'm thinking these [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1759.3600000000001s)]
*  things through. I'm writing to you. I'm warning you of what is good and what is bad. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1763.6000000000001s)]
*  Democracies have the seeds of their own destruction within them. Indeed, today, [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1770.96s)]
*  soft negative power is ascendant. That is the West, which obviously includes the United States, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1774.8000000000002s)]
*  is regressing toward the more primitive way of thinking and governing, and the more aggressive [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1780.48s)]
*  form of negative power. The circle of liberty and security surrounding each individual is shrinking [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1786.0s)]
*  as the supposed common good and public interest defined and determined by a relative handful of [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1791.8400000000001s)]
*  masterminds and politicians is said to be increasingly imperative and paramount. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1797.76s)]
*  The assumed legitimacy for interference in the individual's life has become so routine, assumed [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1803.12s)]
*  to be both necessary and inevitable, that their justifications are less important anymore. The [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1808.72s)]
*  growth of centralized government and its attendant authority are presented as, and indeed seen by [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1815.2s)]
*  many as, predestined, even essential to human and societal progress. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1820.8s)]
*  This is in my new book, On Power. You're getting a little bit of an audio version from me live, [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1828.48s)]
*  which is not available yet, but will be soon. If you want to grab your copy, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1836.56s)]

*  I realize that what follows in the book will be dismissed or castigated by certain partisans and [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1844.4s)]
*  fanatics, but that's to be expected since my observations involve them, and they are not [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1853.6000000000001s)]
*  laudatory. And truth among the most dangerous domestic menaces to present-day America is the [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1859.6000000000001s)]
*  Democrat Party. It is a political institution that exists for the purpose of agitating for, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1864.88s)]
*  and in fact, breaching the Constitution's firewalls in pursuit of the ever-elusive [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1870.64s)]
*  earthly utopia. It is home to, among others, a conglomeration of Marxists, [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1876.16s)]
*  socialists, and Islamist ideologues and activists. Of course, this is not to say that the majority of [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1880.24s)]
*  its membership share that ideology. However, the majority of its membership does not rule the party. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1885.6000000000001s)]
*  The people in the party don't rule the party. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1894.0800000000002s)]
*  I say this not as hyperbole for partisan political purposes, but as an everyday witness with [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1896.4s)]
*  functioning eyes and ears, reading and hearing the daily barrage of declarations and promises [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1901.2s)]
*  about the fundamental transformation of America and the dogged assault on Americans' foundations [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1906.8000000000002s)]
*  by its academics, Democrat Party apparatchiks and surrogates. Indeed, unlike reform and [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1912.0s)]
*  the fundamental transformation which they speak, it's the wholesale transmutation [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1919.44s)]
*  of a nation's character and traditions. I'm not going to read the whole book, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1927.6s)]
*  although I did the whole audio for the book. And there's much more than that. Just as yesterday [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1933.28s)]
*  when I was talking about sovereignty and God and the West and the Enlightenment versus Islam and [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1939.52s)]
*  Marxism and their mental approach and world view, it's all coming together. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1946.08s)]
*  It's all coming together. And I break it apart and then put it back together so you can understand it. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1953.68s)]
*  So you can understand it. This book, On Power, I've written a lot of important books. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1960.72s)]
*  I wrote a book, Liberty and Tyranny, that sold a million and a half copies. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1969.52s)]
*  I wrote a book, American Marxism, that sold 1.4 million copies. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1972.96s)]
*  This may be more important than those books, given the times we live in. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1977.68s)]
*  For too many Americans, our guard is down. Our guard is down. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1984.08s)]
*  I hope you'll take advantage of this. I really do. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1992.1599999999999s)]
*  We're going to talk about it a lot more because it's philosophy, it's scholarship, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=1994.3999999999999s)]
*  it's history, but their application apply to this day and this minute to your lives. Crucially [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2000.72s)]
*  important. I'll be right back. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2010.48s)]
*  President Trump is in Washington with a mandate from the American people to solve the border crisis, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2024.3999999999999s)]

*  judges across our country have consistently been blocking President Trump's attempts to fulfill [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2034.3999999999999s)]
*  his mandate. The Heritage Foundation has been analyzing the situation and they've been able to [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2039.6799999999998s)]

*  Mamdani. Cut eight, go. You call yourself a democratic socialist. The word socialist, of course, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2098.7200000000003s)]
*  has been vilified and used to attack you specifically. How do you define being a [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2105.04s)]
*  democratic socialist? I think of the words of Dr. King who decades ago said, well Dr. King was a [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2110.0s)]
*  Republican and you're a Marxist Islamist, so don't defame Dr. King. You should quote who you really [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2115.2s)]
*  believe. Arafat, people like that. You're a fraud and a phony and a fool. Go ahead. Socialism, there [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2121.6s)]
*  must be a better distribution of wealth for all of God's children in this country. And it gets to [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2130.16s)]
*  the heart of the matter. And who's going to figure that out? You? You're going to do that? [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2134.32s)]
*  Tell me, ladies and gentlemen, as I also explained in the book, where is there more prosperity for [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2138.32s)]
*  more people on the face of the earth than in the United States of America? Where? Nowhere. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2142.2400000000002s)]
*  In the regimes where the government controls the distribution of food and so forth, most of the [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2149.52s)]
*  people are starving. So what this man does is he takes a third world model, economic socialism, [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2153.52s)]
*  Marxist ideology, and he's going to create more wealth and equality. And he quotes Dr. Martin [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2164.56s)]
*  Luther King for his propositions. Go ahead. And my belief that every New Yorker should have what [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2172.6400000000003s)]

*  What does that mean? It means nothing. It means nothing. And this is what the Marxists do. I [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2194.8s)]
*  have a whole chapter, by the way, on language. This is the language. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2202.96s)]

*  creating too much material wealth. Now they argue there's not enough to go around. Whatever works. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2248.48s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2256.4s)]

*  Grocery store chains so people have food at a good price. Choices they don't have anywhere [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2285.12s)]
*  else on the face of the earth in their communities, in their neighborhoods. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2289.92s)]
*  So who cares if that person's wealthy? What does that have to do with anything? [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2294.32s)]
*  Or somebody invents something that we need and use helps the quality of life. They're going to [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2298.0s)]
*  be wealthy too, but that means more and more of you want to buy it. So what's wrong with that? [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2303.68s)]
*  Why is it that the illegal alien, the welfare recipient, why is it that they are to be held [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2308.24s)]

*  So what? Maybe there ought to be a 10,000 people depending on what they're creating [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2328.0800000000004s)]
*  or what they produced. They're not robbing banks, America. They're not robbing banks. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2334.32s)]
*  We're giving them our money in small ways and large. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2340.88s)]

*  And with this clown who's 33, who hasn't produced or created a damn thing, he wants to [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2386.8s)]

*  Now broadcasting from the underground command post deep in the bowels of a hidden bunker somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building. We've once again made contact with our leader, Mark Levin. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2426.2400000000002s)]
*  Hello America, Mark Levin here. Our number 877-381-3811-877-38138. When I will be on Hannity tonight, I will be flying quickly, not literally, but quickly in my vehicle. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2441.2s)]
*  From my radio location to my TV studio as quickly as I can. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2463.52s)]
*  So I could be on the Hannity program. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2471.28s)]
*  You know, I also discuss in the book related to what's going on in New York and all this [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2476.96s)]
*  pablum about Marxism. A couple of things that you'll learn from the book on power as well. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2481.84s)]
*  Marxism was always flawed for a number of reasons. Number one, the great second industrial revolution began in around 1870. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2488.4s)]
*  Most of what Marx and Engels wrote preceded 1870. They saw the first industrial revolution, which was okay, but it was the second one where there was this explosion of growth and inventions and development and so forth and so on. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2501.2s)]
*  When Marx was writing about capitalism, a word he termed, that didn't exist. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2517.68s)]
*  It didn't even exist. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2524.4s)]
*  Number two, Marxism and all these other isms that predict the promised land, the end of society, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2525.36s)]
*  are flawed. How can you predict the end of society? I don't mean that it will end, but that what the final society will look like. How do you know that? [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2536.4s)]
*  See, we don't do that here. Our system isn't set up that way that we're going to do this, this, this, and this to meet the promised land to get to the promise. That's not what we do. We set up a realistic system. We have our founders did framers through the Constitution. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2546.7999999999997s)]
*  To live by day by day. We hope to preserve it for our children and grandchildren as long as we possibly can. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2561.44s)]
*  But we don't say the American government at the very end at the pinnacle is going to look like X. No, we don't. And yet Marxists do that. Islamists do that. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2569.12s)]
*  That's another great fault, as I explained in the book. But I also explain in the book to counter this, this Marx, they keep calling him a socialist. Socialism is an economic policy. And Marx said, so is socialism. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2578.88s)]
*  So when I talk about this guy, Zoran Mamdouh, who was the first to say that communism was the last step before communism, he said, socialism is the last step before communism. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2588.64s)]
*  So when I talk about this guy, Zoran Mamdouh, he said, socialism is the last step before communism. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2598.8799999999997s)]
*  And Marx said, socialism is the last step before communism. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2606.96s)]
*  So when I talk about this guy, Zoran Mamdouh, he's a Marxist. He supports economic socialism, just like AOC, just like Bernie Sanders and so forth. OK. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2614.96s)]
*  Now use this word Marxism. When I used it on talk radio on Fox, nobody would use it. They kept saying socialism, progressivism, left wingism. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2626.48s)]
*  And so I would tell them I would tell them off air and on. Stop it. And stop calling them progressives. That's their own nomenclature. They gave it to themselves. They're not progressive. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2636.32s)]
*  Marxism. So now you hear the word Marxism. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2646.2400000000002s)]
*  Three or four years ago, people were afraid to get my god, my god. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2648.48s)]
*  These guys are Marxist Islamist. They're afraid of using the word Islamist. Hopefully not anymore. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2655.36s)]
*  But I explain in the book, let's just step back a second. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2665.68s)]
*  When you go into a grocery store. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2671.44s)]
*  And we're going to have one of the great grocers on the program in about what is it? Ten, fifteen minutes. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2673.04s)]
*  Not a big chain grocery store, but a very important family chain of grocery stores in New York. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2683.12s)]
*  You have more choices. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2691.92s)]
*  Of every kind and every category of food and drink. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2694.96s)]
*  Than the kings and queens of the wealthiest monarchies had a hundred years ago. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2698.0s)]
*  You realize that? [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2705.44s)]
*  You have more choices. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2708.4s)]
*  Than the Rothschilds have. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2713.04s)]
*  Than the Rockefellers had originally. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2715.12s)]
*  Than the Vanderbilt's had. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2718.0s)]
*  You have more choices today. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2720.48s)]
*  You have more choices today. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2722.88s)]
*  It's just a regular American going into a grocery store, going to a supermarket. You have even more. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2725.68s)]
*  How did that happen? By government? [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2730.88s)]
*  We take things for granted. We don't even realize where they come from. You will understand it when you read my book on power. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2735.68s)]
*  We complain about the airports. I get it. So do I. We complain about air flight. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2741.12s)]
*  Step back a minute. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2748.56s)]
*  Those of you who fly, you get on a jet. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2749.44s)]
*  It's air conditioned. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2753.44s)]
*  Maybe you're on one of these jets that have television. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2758.08s)]
*  Maybe not. Maybe they have Wi-Fi. You can plug in. Maybe listen to whatever you want. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2760.88s)]
*  On an iPhone. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2766.2400000000002s)]
*  On a laptop. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2767.76s)]
*  And if you're lucky, maybe they'll serve you some peanuts or some popcorn or something like that. Maybe not. But you'll get a drink, right? [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2770.4s)]
*  Soda or juice or booze or whatever it is. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2776.0s)]
*  You're 35,000 feet in the sky. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2781.28s)]
*  You don't even realize it. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2786.32s)]
*  That didn't exist 100 years ago. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2792.48s)]
*  Nothing like it. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2795.36s)]
*  Nothing like it. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2797.92s)]
*  Look what we take for advantage. You walk into your house. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2801.6s)]
*  Look what we take for advantage. You walk into your room and you turn the lights on. Where does that come from? [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2804.08s)]
*  You turn the faucet on and there's water. It's clean. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2810.72s)]
*  If you want hot water, you got hot water. You want cold water, you have cold water. At your fingertips. At your fingertips. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2815.2799999999997s)]
*  Did that come from Marxism? [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2820.72s)]
*  Or did that come from capitalism? [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2823.36s)]
*  We complain about health care. The Marxists are good at this because everybody's annoyed with insurance company and costs and li- okay. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2825.36s)]
*  I got it. Is there another country on the face of the earth we have access to the kinds of prescription drugs and health care that you have in the United States? [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2836.88s)]

*  You go into the health care system such as it is with these socialist systems. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2869.76s)]
*  Whether it's private, public, private health, social, or public health, they're using the medicines for the most part that we invent in the United States of America. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2873.04s)]
*  These systems, whether it's Britain or France or you name it, you have a fairly rare disease. They don't have any medicine for you and they're not going to pay for it. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2879.04s)]
*  They come to the United States, these people. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2889.04s)]
*  In Canada, where they have a socialist health care system, they come to the United States. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2893.04s)]
*  The lines are long. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2899.04s)]

*  Capitalism. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2931.04s)]
*  Almost everybody has an automobile. Some families have two or three. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2935.04s)]
*  What created that? Capitalism. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2939.04s)]
*  You want heat in the winter? You got heat in the winter. You want air conditioning in the summer? You got air conditioning in the summer. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2945.04s)]
*  You may not like the cost, but for the most part, the cost is higher because of government. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2951.04s)]
*  Government regulations, government limitations on drilling and production. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2955.04s)]

*  That's capitalism. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2967.04s)]
*  It's amazing, isn't it, Mr. Producer? [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2975.04s)]
*  And it's attacked because people don't know how to discuss it. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2979.04s)]
*  What about equality and freedom under capitalism? [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2983.04s)]
*  Capitalism is the most equal system on the face of the earth. Why? [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2985.04s)]
*  Because rich people can become poor and poor people can become rich. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2989.04s)]
*  It's an amazing thing. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=2995.04s)]

*  Chairman and CEO of grocery chains, Christides and Digestino Supermarkets. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3135.04s)]
*  John, how are you? [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3141.04s)]
*  I am fine. Thank you, Mark, for having me on. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3143.04s)]
*  We're in crisis mode. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3146.04s)]
*  There's an undercurrent in this country, Mark, that they're taking over city by city. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3149.04s)]
*  And look, I was a Democrat at one time. I was a Bill Clinton Democrat. I ran his campaign. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3156.04s)]
*  But there's no way you could be a Democrat today. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3162.04s)]
*  There's no way. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3165.04s)]
*  I mean, there's an undercurrent. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3166.04s)]
*  We have common sense Democrats and we have the loonies. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3170.04s)]
*  And the common sense Democrats don't have the courage to stand up against the loonies. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3174.04s)]
*  And right now, New York is under attack. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3180.04s)]
*  You are under attack. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3184.04s)]
*  And what's crazy is that these Democrats seem to be lining up behind the guys. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3186.04s)]
*  They're behind the guys. Schumer and all these others. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3192.04s)]
*  And I'll speak as a Jew. I mean, this guy's an anti-Semite and all the rest. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3196.04s)]
*  They're still lining up behind it. What do you make of that? [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3200.04s)]
*  He's part of the Columbia University crowd. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3203.04s)]
*  I think his parents are Columbia University graduates or they're professors there. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3207.04s)]
*  And they started a movement and they're trying to take over. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3213.04s)]
*  It's part of AOC, the same movement. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3220.04s)]
*  They're trying to take over the Democratic Party completely. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3223.04s)]
*  I was very, very much disappointed. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3228.04s)]
*  You know, my friend and he's still my friend. I love the guy. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3231.04s)]
*  I couldn't believe that my friend Bill Clinton sent out the tweet yesterday. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3235.04s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3239.04s)]
*  Oh my God. Yep. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3240.04s)]
*  And you know, it's just disappointing. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3241.04s)]
*  But all canons are lined up, whether you're a Democrat, whether you're a Republican, [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3246.04s)]
*  whether you're independent, this guy has to go down. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3252.04s)]
*  And I think that's the number one priority of common sense people in New York City. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3256.04s)]
*  He wants massive tax increases that will chase businesses. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3264.04s)]
*  He certainly won't attract businesses. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3267.04s)]
*  He basically wants to defund the cops, he said. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3270.04s)]
*  I mean, this is a real crackpot. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3273.04s)]
*  And so if he gets in, by God, I hope he doesn't. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3275.04s)]
*  Look, I'm a Philadelphian, but we all know New York's the greatest city. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3279.04s)]
*  It's not necessarily the greatest sports teams, am I humble, but the greatest city. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3282.04s)]
*  And so if this guy takes over the city, it's going to be like London. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3287.04s)]
*  It's going to be like that nut job in London. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3291.04s)]
*  And he's going to attract the wrong people and the other people. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3294.04s)]
*  And I don't mean ethnicity. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3297.04s)]
*  I mean, in terms of investment and that sort of thing. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3298.04s)]
*  By the way, an ideology and other people, it's going to depopulate this. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3301.04s)]
*  Let me ask you something. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3306.04s)]
*  You have these grocery stores and you've contributed a lot to this city [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3307.04s)]
*  in terms of the neighborhood grocery stores. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3313.04s)]
*  People love your grocery stores and not these massive chains and that sort of thing. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3315.04s)]
*  And you say, look, I'm probably going to have to shut down these stores. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3319.04s)]
*  The guy wants to basically take over the grocery business, no? [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3322.04s)]
*  Well, you know, he wants to take over the grocery business. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3327.04s)]
*  And like I said on Fox the other day, you can't fight City Hall. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3332.04s)]
*  If City Hall wants to run the grocery business, they're going to run it. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3337.04s)]
*  And nobody gets arrested for stealing. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3343.04s)]
*  Nobody goes to jail. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3346.04s)]
*  It'd be like Los Angeles. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3348.04s)]
*  You could steal $985 and nobody's going to say anything to you. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3349.04s)]
*  So New York is going to become worse than Chicago, worse than Los Angeles. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3354.04s)]
*  And that's why whether you're Democrats or Republicans, everybody has to put their foot down. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3360.04s)]
*  You can't allow socialists to take over New York City, one of the greatest cities in the world. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3368.04s)]
*  John, tell the nation a little bit about your background. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3373.04s)]
*  Were you raised as a trust fund child? [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3377.04s)]
*  How did you get where you are? [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3380.04s)]
*  Well, my book tells a story. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3383.04s)]
*  I came to America. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3387.04s)]
*  My two grandfathers came to America in 1913. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3389.04s)]
*  And they came over to find the streets paved with gold. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3393.04s)]
*  They left my father in the old country to take care of the three sisters and his mother. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3399.04s)]
*  And my father worked on the lighthouse for 17 years to earn a few lira and got paid by the Italian government in lira to feed his sisters. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3406.04s)]
*  And then after World War II, when the Brits came over to Greece, took back the islands, took back the lighthouse, my father lost his job, married my mom, came to America. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3417.04s)]
*  I was six months old. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3431.04s)]
*  We grew up in Harlem. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3433.04s)]
*  My father never made more than $100 a week as a busboy in a restaurant. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3436.04s)]
*  And I got lucky and my book. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3443.04s)]
*  And I went to public school. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3448.04s)]
*  I went to Brooklyn Tech, one of their best high schools. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3450.04s)]
*  I had the congressional nomination for West Point in 1966. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3453.04s)]
*  But I was the only child and my mother cried, won't let me go. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3457.04s)]
*  I went to New York University and I grew the company and I started working for my quasi cousin. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3461.04s)]
*  And I in my senior year in college in New York University, I had one store and I ended up having 10 stores by the age of 23, 24, making a million dollars a year. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3471.04s)]
*  And in 1973, 74 million dollars a year was a lot of money. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3484.04s)]
*  Now these stores you have, they're pretty much neighborhood stores, aren't they? [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3488.04s)]
*  Right now the stores we have left in New York City are neighborhood stores. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3497.04s)]
*  We thought we had, but right now the supermarket business is our smallest business of any of our companies. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3502.04s)]
*  I've run it for 54 years. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3511.04s)]
*  And what I said on television is, my son was supposed to take over for me and I'm older than you, Mark. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3513.04s)]
*  And I don't want my son running the supermarket business in 54 years. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3521.04s)]
*  I don't want my son to have the same burden on his shoulders to run it. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3528.04s)]
*  We do very well in the real estate business. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3535.04s)]
*  We do very well in the energy business. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3538.04s)]
*  I love the media business. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3540.04s)]
*  You know, I enjoy it. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3542.04s)]
*  I work 20 hours a week doing shows. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3544.04s)]
*  And I just want to keep America free. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3547.04s)]
*  And that's my duty. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3551.04s)]
*  Mark Levin, it's your duty to get the truth out. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3553.04s)]
*  John, our catch is we like to call you. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3557.04s)]
*  Let's hold you over. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3560.04s)]
*  I've got several more questions. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3562.04s)]

*  And much more than that, you heard him, he owns a lot. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3680.04s)]
*  He came here with nothing. His parents came here with nothing. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3684.04s)]
*  And he's the example of capitalism and how it works. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3687.04s)]
*  You can come with nothing and become wealthy. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3691.04s)]
*  You can come with nothing, become middle class, you can be wealthy and lose everything. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3693.04s)]
*  But I can tell you this, you won't be prosperous under any circumstances [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3697.04s)]
*  under a Marxist who imposes a socialist type of regime. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3701.04s)]
*  Guy's 33 years old, John. He doesn't know a damn thing about economics. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3705.04s)]
*  He's an ideologue, Bernie Sanders, AOC and the rest of them. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3708.04s)]
*  And do you think that the people of New York will rally, [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3712.04s)]
*  that the donors to these campaigns will rally, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3716.04s)]
*  get behind somebody and be able to defeat him? [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3719.04s)]
*  It seems like an uphill battle right now. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3722.04s)]
*  It's an uphill battle right now. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3725.04s)]
*  We have to consolidate. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3728.04s)]
*  Cuomo and Eric Adams can't run on the same ticket or in November. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3732.04s)]
*  I think one of them has to bow out and has to be one on one against the socialist. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3741.04s)]
*  And that's the only way we can make sure that he doesn't win. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3748.04s)]
*  We have to come up with a game plan. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3753.04s)]
*  The common sense people of New York City have to come up with a game plan [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3756.04s)]
*  not to allow socialism to take over New York. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3760.04s)]
*  And that's the number one goal. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3763.04s)]
*  Now you have a lot of context there, Republican and Democrat. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3766.04s)]
*  Do you get the sense that there's heightened concern [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3769.04s)]
*  and that people are starting to rally and trying to figure out what to do about this? [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3772.04s)]
*  All of a sudden everybody's here to rally. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3777.04s)]
*  The common sense Democrats that I'm friends with, [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3780.04s)]
*  right now they want that guy out. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3783.04s)]
*  The common sense Republicans want the guy out. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3786.04s)]
*  So we're consolidating everything and we have to do it. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3789.04s)]
*  I mean we can't lose New York City. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3795.04s)]
*  There's too many people that work too hard to make New York City the greatest city in the world. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3798.04s)]
*  All right. Well, we wish you well. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3803.04s)]
*  I'd like to bring you back in a month or two or three and see how things are going [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3805.04s)]
*  because this affects the whole nation. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3808.04s)]
*  I mean when these cities start getting picked off like this, and they are, [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3811.04s)]
*  they're targeting the cities, they have a grand strategy. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3814.04s)]
*  He was he's a founder of Students for Justice in Palestine, [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3817.04s)]
*  which is a Hamas front group for God sakes. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3821.04s)]
*  PDS, BDS, which is an organization that has its purpose to destroy Israel economically. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3824.04s)]
*  He's talking about global intifada. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3830.04s)]
*  That is a terrorism, a terrorism agenda. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3832.04s)]
*  I mean, this guy's not some moderate Muslim, which he pretends to be. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3837.04s)]
*  He's an all out Islamist, this guy, no? [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3841.04s)]
*  Absolutely. Now, I will tell you one of the things that came up. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3845.04s)]
*  I had the GOP chair with us on a five o'clock show just before you today, Michael Watley. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3850.04s)]
*  And remember when 20,000 Chinese quasi soldier looking 20 year olds came into America? [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3858.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3870.04s)]
*  I think that coincides with the 20,000 licenses that the FBI found the Chinese issuing them. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3871.04s)]
*  And those 20,000 were responsible to go into key American states [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3883.04s)]
*  and change those states from Republican to Democratic. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3890.04s)]
*  And that was their mission for those 20,000 of them. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3897.04s)]
*  Unbelievable. I think that was the whole purpose of the open borders, you know, to change the election. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3900.04s)]
*  The 20,000 number of Chinese of military age that came in at the same time we had 20,000 drivers licenses issued to them. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3906.04s)]
*  Well, how does it say? Tick, tick, tick, tick. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3919.04s)]
*  You're right. And it is. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3923.04s)]
*  All right, John, John Ketscher, MEDES, who is a great guy who I've just gotten to know mostly right in this conversation. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3926.04s)]

*  Pretty good, don't you think? He understands what's going on. That's for sure. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3961.04s)]
*  He's got his own radio show before mine on in New York on W.A.B.C. five to six. Works very, very hard. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=3965.04s)]

*  Because it's MSNBC, that's how. Go ahead. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4113.04s)]
*  24 hours, including from Stephen Miller, Elise Stefanik, the NRC. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4117.04s)]
*  Let's smear them. Let's smear them. Let's smear them. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4122.04s)]
*  This guy, poor guy, is going to come under attack. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4126.04s)]
*  Whatever you do, don't scrutinize him. Whatever you do, lie about him. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4129.04s)]
*  Pretend he's not an anti-Semite. Pretend he doesn't support the global intifada. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4132.04s)]
*  He said it. Pretend he doesn't support BDS. He said it. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4138.04s)]
*  Pretend he's not a Student for Justice and Palestine founder. He did it. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4143.04s)]
*  Guy's not even hiding who he is. Well, he's trying to kind of, you know, a little bit now. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4148.04s)]
*  But what kind of questioning is this from Pesci and MSNBC? [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4153.04s)]
*  He's a Democrat. That's all they care about. Democrat, Democrat. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4156.04s)]
*  They go vote Goo Goo Gaga, you know, the spittles coming down their lip. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4160.04s)]
*  They can't wait to vote for that. Where is he? Where is he? [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4164.04s)]
*  That's what I mean. This is authoritarian democracy. It's in the book. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4167.04s)]
*  I spell it out in much more detail than you heard. On power. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4172.04s)]
*  It's authoritarian democracy. In other words, you go through the motions. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4176.04s)]
*  You vote. You elect them. And you're going to vote. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4180.04s)]
*  You vote. You elect them. And you don't have a democracy anymore. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4183.04s)]
*  You have an autocracy, but you voted for him. That's all that matters, right? [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4188.04s)]
*  Authoritarian democracy. This guy's an authoritarian. That's what he is. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4193.04s)]
*  Who he was being old. Shut up, old man. That's what he is. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4197.04s)]
*  Go ahead. And Islamophobic campaign against you. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4202.04s)]
*  Oh, Islamic phobic campaign. God, I detest these white liberals. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4207.04s)]
*  I really do. I detest them. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4211.04s)]
*  The guy talks like David Duke. He talks like a neo-Nazi. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4216.04s)]
*  He talks like a Klansman. He talks like some of these podcasters. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4220.04s)]
*  And already you and I are Islamophobic. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4227.04s)]
*  Notice she's never interviewed Zudy Jasser. I asked him. I asked him. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4231.04s)]
*  You ever been on MSNBC or these other stations to talk about your book? [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4236.04s)]
*  Never asked. Never. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4241.04s)]
*  So it's Islamophobic now to bring this up. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4244.04s)]
*  Says the dumb, lily white liberal who covered up for Joe Biden and his dementia. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4248.04s)]
*  Who gets a TV platform because she's so substantive. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4256.04s)]
*  Go ahead. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4266.04s)]
*  And you've lived this, but for people who are just tuning in, it's a continuation of some of the tactics that we saw during the primary. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4268.04s)]
*  But it's going to come tenfold. I know you know that. But how are you going to handle that? [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4274.04s)]
*  Listen to this. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4279.04s)]
*  How come you don't talk about the things he said, lady? [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4282.04s)]
*  How come you don't talk about the things he has said? [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4285.04s)]
*  Frightening the people that watch this MSNBC, or as I call it, MSLSD. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4289.04s)]
*  It is frightening. She's a liar. She's a propagandist. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4293.04s)]
*  Mr. Producer, let's try and get this guy on my show. Can we do that? [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4298.04s)]
*  Zoran Mamdani. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4304.04s)]
*  I mean, we're on in New York on WABC. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4308.04s)]
*  We're everywhere. I'll give him a whole national platform. I'll give him a worldwide platform. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4312.04s)]
*  Worldwide. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4318.04s)]
*  Worldwide. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4320.04s)]
*  Invite him on. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4321.04s)]
*  Won't get an interview like this, some kiss-ass stupid interview. Islamophobia. No, no, no. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4324.04s)]
*  When somebody is what he is, it has nothing to do with Islam, quite frankly. Frankly, he's an Islamist. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4331.04s)]
*  He's not a moderate Muslim. No, he's an Islamist. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4339.04s)]
*  And so we want to do a real interview. We'll see. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4345.04s)]
*  He's working hard. He's campaigning, going door to door, going on radio. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4348.04s)]
*  Well, we're going to find out if he'll come. I really pray he does. I really do. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4353.04s)]
*  He's smart. He'll be able to defeat me in a debate. Oh, yeah. He'll be tremendous. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4358.04s)]
*  What am I? I'm just a talk show host. That's all. Just a talk show host. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4364.04s)]
*  I'm just a talk show host. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4368.04s)]
*  Rich, I want you to offer him any day this week and any day next week we're here. Okay? [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4373.04s)]
*  And I'll be right back. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4379.04s)]
*  Hello, Ben. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4381.04s)]
*  Pure Talk, my wireless company, a veteran-led company, believes every man and woman who has faithfully served this country deserves to proudly fly an American flag [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4388.04s)]
*  that was made in America. And listen to this. That's why Pure Talk is on a mission to give an allegiance flag, the highest quality American flag ever, [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4396.04s)]
*  to 1,000 U.S. veterans in time for the patriotic holidays. Switch your cell phone service to Pure Talk today. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4405.04s)]
*  Know that you're supporting a company that will be providing these high quality flags made in America to deserving veterans. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4412.04s)]
*  With plans from just $25 a month for unlimited talk, text, and plenty of data, you can enjoy America's most dependable 5G network while cutting your cell phone bill, in many cases, in half. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4418.04s)]
*  The average Pure Talk family saves over $1,000 a year. Just go to puretalk.com slash levine. That's pure talk.com slash levine to switch hassle-free in as little as 10 minutes. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4429.04s)]
*  Again, that's pure talk.com slash levine. Switch to a wireless company that supports our veterans that is patriotic, based right here in America. Switch to Pure Talk. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4442.04s)]
*  Saturday night, on Life, Liberty, and Levin, we're going to have Newt Gingrich and Colonel Richard Kemp. Colonel Richard Kemp, as you may know, was the commander of British forces in Afghanistan. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4457.04s)]
*  What you may not know is all through these battles, Israel taking it to a round, he was in Tel Aviv. And he was there when the rockets were flying, these ballistic missiles which are massive. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4467.04s)]
*  And he's remarkable because a year ago, April, I was there, my wife was there, a few of our family members with us, and you see these missiles flying. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4478.04s)]
*  And you head to these, you know, the garage and so forth, and he's out there with his video, he's using his iPhone, the video, at Mr. Producer. Very courageous man. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4486.04s)]
*  The problem with these ballistic missiles is if you get a direct hit, it doesn't matter if you have a safe room or not, it blows them off the face of the earth, and this is the problem. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4496.04s)]
*  I'm seeing all kinds of proposals for us to help the Iranian economy and so forth, and I'm seeing a lot of people who are going to be in the same situation. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4505.04s)]
*  And I'm seeing a lot of proposals for us to help the Iranian economy and so forth and so on. We need to be very sober about this. That's no secret, that's my view. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4513.04s)]
*  We'll be talking about this with Newt on Saturday as well, because what happens after the fighting matters as much as what took place during the fighting. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4523.04s)]
*  And that's crucial. It's important to understand the mindset of what we're dealing with that we've talked about here now for a few days, and we'll talk about far into the future. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4532.04s)]
*  I will tell you that the supreme Nazi over there still hasn't surrendered. He still has, he talked about how he defeated the Americans and the Israelis. He's as defined as ever. So is their parliament. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4543.04s)]
*  They're rounding up people by the hundreds and soon the thousands. They're starting to execute people based on suspicion, because it is what it is. It's an Islamist murderous regime. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4556.04s)]
*  And for all the talk about religion, they don't really have that deep a faith in humanity, do they? Since humanity is their target. Humanity is their target. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4567.04s)]
*  So we'll just need to make sure. Take a look at how this breaks out, how this proceeds. I will continue to give my opinion as I always do. I'm not going to change that. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4576.04s)]
*  And it'll be done in a respectful way. And most of the time I'm an all agree and sometimes I may not. So what? [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4589.04s)]
*  Just my opinion, one man's opinion, your opinion too. Now, you understand the enemy. We've talked about this for years. People have been killed by this enemy. People in and around New York, in and around Pennsylvania, in and around Washington, all struck by this enemy. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4596.04s)]
*  And they're not alone. Other people through various acts of terrorism have been struck by this enemy. And every one of us has to have our, you know, belt taken off, our shoes taken off, going through different machines. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4609.04s)]
*  TSA. That's because of the Islamist terrorists. It's them. It's them. It's them. It's them. It's them. It's them. And they're not alone. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4620.04s)]
*  They're not going anywhere. They talk about these sleeper cells. Heightened alert. The heightened alert's not going away. In other words, the enemy's still here, wherever it is. Iran, no matter where it is, it's still here. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4630.04s)]
*  They hate us and they want to kill us. It doesn't matter where we are. It doesn't matter where we are. It doesn't matter where we are. It doesn't matter where we are. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4641.04s)]
*  Heightened alert's not going away. In other words, the enemy's still here, wherever it is. Iran, no matter where it is, it's still here. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4649.04s)]
*  They hate us and they want to kill us. It doesn't matter what we do. It's not a reaction to anything we do. It's because we exist and we don't agree with them. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4657.04s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4668.04s)]
*  On the Underground Command Post, deep in the bowels of a hidden bunker, somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building, we've once again made contact with our leader, Mark Levin. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4679.04s)]
*  Hello America, Mark Levin here, our number 877-381-3811. 877-381-3811. I won't be on Hannity in an hour. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4695.04s)]
*  I want to encourage you to set your DVR, if that's alright, to Life, Liberty and Levin, 8pm Eastern, on Saturday and Sunday. Bigger and bigger shows. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4705.04s)]
*  Our ratings, Saturday of course, was when the battle between Israel and Iran started. I was on with Hannity from 9 to 11. Massive ratings. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4716.04s)]
*  The biggest two hours on the whole station. It's my pleasure to contribute to that. Sunday night, our program had the highest overall audience, the highest numbers. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4725.04s)]
*  In the evening prime time, on Sunday as well, we crushed CNN and MSNBC and all the rest of it. I was up against the last basketball game of the finals, which had 16 million viewers. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4741.04s)]
*  We're really kicking ass. We really are. I want to thank you folks, whether it's Fox or radio all over the country and all of our great affiliates and so forth. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4756.04s)]
*  Fox's ratings are massive, massive. And same with its other platforms, whether it's YouTube and other digital platforms. Absolutely massive. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4766.04s)]
*  In fact, the ratings are so big, the shows, including mine, we're beating network TV in many instances. So I want to thank you very, very much for watching my show and all the other shows. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4777.04s)]
*  Let me tell you what's going on in Iran right now. And this is old news. This is a couple hours old. In fact, it's half a day old. From our friends at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4790.04s)]
*  Your mass detentions are unfolding. The Iranian authorities have arrested more than 700 people, many more than that now. Since the conflict with Israel began on June 13, Iranian state media reported this week the Fars news agency called the detainees Israeli mercenaries. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4804.04s)]
*  We're mainly operating within espionage and sabotage networks and were identified and arrested based on tip offs of intelligence operations. Of course, most of that's a lie. They target who they want to take out and what ethnicities they want to destroy. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4820.04s)]
*  And they already hanged three. The Islamic Republic executed three Kurdish men. They hate the Kurdish. They all hate the Kurdish. I love the Kurdish. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4837.04s)]
*  And Razul Ahmad Rasul on June 25 on charges of spying for Israel said the Norei based nonprofit Iran Human Rights reported Iran alleged that the three men had committed acts against God, of course, through collaboration with the enemy. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4843.04s)]
*  More executions may follow. At least six other detainees are awaiting on death row on charges of espionage for Israel. They have their name. You're going to have a Swedish Iranian who they intend to execute. First, Iran's [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4858.04s)]
*  arrested in 2016. They talked about a physician crisis manager researcher. He traveled to Israel and he was arrested on the basis of espionage for Israel. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4862.44s)]
*  He was arrested on the basis of espionage for Israel. He was arrested on the basis of espionage for Israel. He was arrested on the basis of espionage for Israel. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4871.44s)]
*  He was arrested on the basis of espionage for Israel. He was arrested on the basis of espionage for Israel. He was arrested on the basis of espionage for Israel. They have their name. You're going to have a Swedish Iranian who they intend to execute. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4879.44s)]
*  First arrested in 2016. They talked about a physician crisis manager researcher. He traveled from Sweden to Iran on the invitation of the University of Tehran. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4887.44s)]
*  When the regime arrested him, he spent more than nine years on death row as European efforts to secure his release have failed. Reminds me when they took our embassy personnel hostage and just kept holding them, right? [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4896.44s)]
*  Like their friends, the terrorist monsters Hamas, holding the hostages, the Israeli hostages, murdering them, torturing them, starving them to death. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4910.44s)]
*  The regime convicts and imposes the death penalty based on trumped up charges spread terror among the Iranians. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4919.44s)]
*  Meanwhile, Israel's Operation Rising Lion has helped the public realize the Iranian regime is a paper tiger that is weaker than ever, says a senior Iran and financial economic adviser. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4925.44s)]
*  Surges in arrests and executions in Iran consistently reflect the regime's deep rooted fear of its own people. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4936.44s)]
*  Even after Israel strikes, Israeli strikes eliminated senior officials. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4941.44s)]
*  The Islamic Republic remained fixated on repression, terrorizing civilians with checkpoints. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4946.44s)]
*  When the regime turns inward to punish its people, maximum support from Washington for the people must follow. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4951.44s)]
*  That's troubling. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4957.44s)]
*  Now, CNN is a very dishonest media operation. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4958.44s)]
*  I don't even know why it exists anymore. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4964.44s)]
*  And they're reporting. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4966.44s)]
*  Let's see. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4968.44s)]
*  I'm told what they're reporting is not correct. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4970.44s)]
*  So I'm going to hold off on what I was going to say. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4974.44s)]
*  Just hold off. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4976.44s)]
*  It's very important to have real information. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4978.44s)]
*  And unless it's verified by a second source, it's CNN as a first source. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4980.44s)]
*  I'm not going to do it. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4986.44s)]
*  I'm not going to use it. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4988.44s)]
*  But it's very important that you have real information. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4990.44s)]
*  And I'm going to hold off on that. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4992.44s)]
*  I'm going to hold off on that. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4994.44s)]
*  I'm going to hold off on that. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4996.44s)]
*  I'm going to hold off on that. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=4998.44s)]
*  I'm not going to do it. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5000.44s)]
*  I'm not going to use it. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5002.44s)]
*  But it's very important that we not help this current regime in Iran economically. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5004.44s)]
*  This is just my opinion. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5009.44s)]
*  Just my opinion. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5011.44s)]
*  I don't know what's in the pipeline. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5013.44s)]
*  I don't know what's being discussed. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5015.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5017.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5019.44s)]
*  I'm talking about me, myself, and I, all three of us. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5021.44s)]
*  It's very important that that regime not be subsidized. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5023.44s)]
*  We always talk about we don't want our farm money going places. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5025.44s)]
*  OK, this one especially. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5027.44s)]
*  They've not surrendered. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5029.44s)]
*  They've not given up their pursuit of nuclear weapons. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5031.44s)]
*  They've not given up their pursuit of more ballistic weapons. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5033.44s)]
*  They've not recognized the existence of the state of Israel. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5037.44s)]
*  They won't even stop talking about slaughtering the Jews or us. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5040.44s)]
*  Is it asking too much that those should be at least minimal conditions? [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5045.44s)]
*  So we must not build up their economy. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5051.44s)]
*  That's the car before the horse. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5053.44s)]
*  That's the car before the horse, in my humble opinion. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5056.44s)]
*  I think you'll agree. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5061.44s)]
*  You know, you and I, we agree on most things. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5063.44s)]
*  We agree on a lot of stuff. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5065.44s)]
*  As a result of what we believe in and what the president believes in [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5068.44s)]
*  and what MAGA believes in, the Israelis were free to do what they did. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5071.44s)]
*  Our military did what we did. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5076.44s)]
*  And this hideous regime that's been killing Americans for half a century is on its back. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5079.44s)]
*  The isolationists, they were giving it mouth to mouth resuscitation [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5085.44s)]
*  and enjoying every minute of it. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5090.44s)]
*  This country, Qatar, is very evil. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5094.44s)]
*  But they mediate. They create the problem, then they go back and they mediate. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5097.44s)]
*  We're on to them. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5100.44s)]
*  They had an alliance with Iran. They may not anymore. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5102.44s)]
*  Not in their best interests. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5105.44s)]
*  They funded Hamas October 7. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5107.44s)]
*  They're funding all the Islamo-Nazis in our country. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5110.44s)]
*  And one of the royal family members, imagine that, a royal family, [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5114.44s)]
*  one of the royal family members, a woman, [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5118.44s)]
*  came out in strong support of the Democrat nominee for mayor in New York. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5120.44s)]
*  Now what do you think of that? Does that sound okay with you? [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5124.44s)]
*  Now here's Bernie Sanders on MSNBC, a Stalinist. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5128.44s)]
*  He thinks this is great. Cut 10, go. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5131.44s)]
*  Senator, what's your reaction to the big, big upset last night? [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5135.44s)]
*  That's a really tough question by Chris Hayes. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5138.44s)]
*  He's a real clown. Go ahead. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5142.44s)]
*  It was one of the great political victories in modern history. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5145.44s)]
*  Iran ran a brilliant campaign. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5150.44s)]
*  And I think the most significant... [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5153.44s)]
*  Keep in mind, the guy's an anti-Semite. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5155.44s)]
*  He talks about global interfaith. I'm not going to stop. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5158.44s)]
*  Keep this in mind. He talks about BDS. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5162.44s)]
*  He talks about defunding the cops. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5165.44s)]
*  He goes on and on about this stuff, and they're enthusiastic. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5169.44s)]
*  They're excited. They're ecstatic. Go ahead. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5173.44s)]
*  Now I, Chris, would not compare it to Obama or to Clinton. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5177.44s)]
*  What Zeron understood is that in order to win, [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5182.44s)]
*  you've got to be more than charismatic, and he is. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5186.44s)]
*  Shut up, old man. You're grotesque. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5189.44s)]
*  You've milked this country for millions. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5194.44s)]
*  You're the demagogue of the worst order. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5198.44s)]
*  You're a socialist. You're worse. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5201.44s)]
*  I meant to say Stalinist. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5204.44s)]
*  And you go on TV, you go on and on, and these suck-ups listen to you. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5207.44s)]
*  You never get any tough questions. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5213.44s)]
*  You won't come on this show because you're a coward. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5215.44s)]
*  No, you won't. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5217.44s)]
*  And your little friend AOC, she won't come on this show. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5219.44s)]
*  She's a coward. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5222.44s)]
*  And then we got Raskin, the three Muppeteers, [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5223.44s)]
*  the three Mouseketeers of the Stalinist, Islamist, Marxist movement in America. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5226.44s)]
*  Cut 11, go. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5233.44s)]
*  Look, what is the Democratic Party today, Chris? [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5238.44s)]
*  It is... [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5241.44s)]
*  Chris, this guy's not a Democrat. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5242.44s)]
*  He's not a Democrat. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5244.44s)]
*  But what is the Democrat Party today? [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5247.44s)]
*  Why don't you talk about yourself, old man? [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5251.44s)]
*  Why don't you talk about your own political party, old man? [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5253.44s)]
*  Why don't you talk about your own history and background [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5256.44s)]
*  and the kibbutz you were on, the Stalinist kibbutz? [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5258.44s)]
*  Why don't you talk about you [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5260.44s)]
*  and stop casting aspersions on others and projecting on others? [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5262.44s)]
*  All you do is you try and undermine everybody and everything else. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5265.44s)]
*  That's what he does. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5272.44s)]
*  And he gets away with it. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5277.44s)]
*  Because the media suck. I'll be right back. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5279.44s)]
*  Hello, Ben. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5283.44s)]
*  I hope you're doing well. I am. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5313.44s)]
*  I tell you, if you listen to that old music, [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5315.44s)]
*  you're a lot groovier than I thought you were. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5317.44s)]
*  That's some good stuff. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5319.44s)]
*  Yeah, I'm known as being groovy. I've got to be honest with you. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5321.44s)]
*  Let me tell you something. You do a hell of a job on TV. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5325.44s)]
*  Now, I can't watch TV all the time, but when you're there, I try to watch. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5328.44s)]
*  And when I get out of you, there's a hell of a lot of common sense, you know? [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5332.44s)]
*  And patriotism. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5335.44s)]
*  These are the two things that matter to me a whole lot. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5339.44s)]
*  This book about people you know and so forth and so on, [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5341.44s)]
*  I mean, it really touches your heartstrings. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5346.44s)]
*  So tell us why you wrote it, why you chose who you chose, [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5348.44s)]
*  and what you're trying to do. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5352.44s)]
*  You know, I think I'm a pretty simple guy. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5355.44s)]
*  And so it's an easy read, but man, it's impactful. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5357.44s)]
*  And I just feel honored, blessed, if not chosen to get to do it. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5361.44s)]
*  I don't take any credit for it. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5364.44s)]
*  People keep asking how I found these non-people, and I laugh and say, [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5366.44s)]
*  Well, they found me. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5369.44s)]
*  I mean, you're talking about my brother-in-law, [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5370.44s)]
*  a guy that's been an uncle to me since I was three years old, [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5373.44s)]
*  a guy I went to Afghanistan with, a young lady that has an amazing story. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5376.44s)]
*  She was assigned to be my security in Tampa as a police officer. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5380.44s)]
*  And the event, I didn't really need security, so I asked her to come join us for dinner. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5383.44s)]
*  And her boss just happened to be there and said, Yeah, go ahead. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5387.44s)]
*  And just learned her story that way. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5390.44s)]
*  And all these people in this book were put in front of me, and God said, [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5392.44s)]
*  Hey, I dare you to ignore them. And so we wrote a book about them. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5397.44s)]
*  All right. Let's start at the beginning here. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5400.44s)]
*  A lot of people see you. Some know your story. Tell us your story. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5403.44s)]
*  Obviously, in a horrendous event, you lost your legs. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5407.44s)]
*  And yet there you are. You're one of the most positive people I've ever... [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5411.44s)]
*  Look, you're more positive than I am. I'm a wet blanket, let's be honest. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5414.44s)]
*  But when I watch you, you're positive, you're smiling, you're... [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5418.44s)]
*  And I'm sure it's not every minute of the day, but at least that's how you present yourself. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5421.44s)]
*  Yeah, for those that don't know, I was in the Marine Corps for almost eight years. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5427.44s)]
*  And in 2010, I was working as what we would call an EOD or biotech. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5431.44s)]
*  And stepped on an IED while I was working another one in Afghanistan. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5435.44s)]
*  And lost both my legs above the knee, a couple other injuries. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5439.44s)]
*  One of my arms didn't work right, missing a finger, just little things compared to the legs. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5442.44s)]
*  And in my recovery early on, very early on, I've got video to prove it. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5447.44s)]
*  I said, I'd be really wrong of me to be upset over losing my legs, because I didn't lose my legs. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5452.44s)]
*  I was given a second chance at life. I should have died. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5459.44s)]
*  And they kept me alive. So you can't resent what keeping me alive entailed. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5462.44s)]
*  And so I guess having kids goes a long way with that. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5467.44s)]
*  Knowing you still got to be a son, a brother, and hopefully one day be a husband at the time in my mind. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5471.44s)]
*  And these responsibilities is what I looked at. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5477.44s)]
*  The things I was still responsible for were really important to me. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5480.44s)]
*  And those people and those things deserve my attention. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5483.44s)]
*  So who am I to sit here and cry about it? [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5486.44s)]
*  And I realize if you work hard enough, most of that stuff that you think holds you back is just not a big deal. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5488.44s)]
*  And so here I am 15 years later, come August, and had a chance to learn from a lot of good people and read. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5495.44s)]
*  And take some some hip pocket wisdom from my dad and do the things we do now on television and being analytical and providing too much opinion sometimes. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5503.44s)]
*  But then having that platform gives you the chance. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5513.44s)]
*  It's really special to you. It's the most valuable asset I have after my family is that just that platform. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5517.44s)]
*  Because when you get the chance to use it for something like this, man, it just really it changes lives. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5522.44s)]
*  Talking to Joey Jones, he's got this fantastic book. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5528.44s)]
*  I think it's number one on the New York Times list, isn't it? [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5531.44s)]
*  I think I just sold it. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5533.44s)]
*  Can you believe that? [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5534.44s)]
*  The New York Times had to they had to bend the knee and give a Fox News books book. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5535.44s)]
*  Number one means that we really did well. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5541.44s)]
*  And so that's all thanks to people like yourself willing to have me on and talk about the book and then the nine people in it. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5544.44s)]
*  It's due to you. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5551.44s)]
*  You don't give yourself enough credit. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5553.44s)]
*  The book is behind the badge. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5554.44s)]
*  All right. Let's pick one of these nine people and give us give us a feel for the book. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5555.44s)]
*  And what is it that you write about one of these nine people? [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5560.44s)]
*  Sure. And, you know, it's almost it's almost unfair. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5564.44s)]
*  But any of the nine I'll go with Justin Heflin. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5568.44s)]
*  Justin Heflin is a guy that he was a Marine EOD tech as well. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5571.44s)]
*  We and this is what we call it as I was leaving Afghanistan. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5575.44s)]
*  His unit was getting there. I knew who he was. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5578.44s)]
*  He did multiple deployments in Marine Corps. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5580.44s)]
*  He did one tough one in Afghanistan, taking bombs apart. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5582.44s)]
*  Justin grew up on a Marine Corps base. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5585.44s)]
*  His dad was a Marine and got out and became a cop. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5587.44s)]
*  His dad was using a fedorin tablets when they were legal. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5590.44s)]
*  And he worked in a small town, so he didn't have a great cop salary. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5593.44s)]
*  So he did security at night, used those a fedorin tablets to stay awake. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5597.44s)]
*  And eventually he lost his job because of them. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5601.44s)]
*  Not a bad guy. Made a bad decision. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5603.44s)]
*  Justin comes home from Afghanistan years later, becomes a police officer, eventually becomes an Indiana trooper, which is, you know, [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5605.44s)]
*  elite for that type of work. And Justin's on a call one night and they say, [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5611.44s)]
*  hey, we've had a fatality, a man on a bicycle struck by a car. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5617.44s)]
*  He's rushing to the scene because that's his job. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5620.44s)]
*  And on a road that nobody's ever on, a car speeds past him. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5623.44s)]
*  So he had to turn around and pull the speeder over. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5626.44s)]
*  He hears a call coming on the radio about what happened. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5628.44s)]
*  They're kind of making jokes because that's what we do to get ourselves through traumatic experiences. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5631.44s)]
*  Nothing mean, but just make, you know, kind of lighten the mood and dark humor. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5635.44s)]
*  He enjoys it, chimes in with it, gets back to the office at night and finds out the guy on the bicycle that was killed by a car was his dad. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5639.44s)]
*  And so Justin's story has this sad traumatic incident, but from it comes redemption. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5646.44s)]
*  Justin is the best trooper you could be. He was the best Marine you could be. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5652.44s)]
*  He honors his dad every day by creating a new legacy. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5657.44s)]
*  And a few years later, Justin was at a scene where someone was about to expire in a bad crass. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5661.44s)]
*  Justin couldn't get to him, but he could hold his hand and tell him everything's going to be OK. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5668.44s)]
*  And he was holding his hand when he passed away. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5673.44s)]
*  And in that moment, he was reminded of the teenager that held his dad's hand when he couldn't be there. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5675.44s)]
*  And it all kind of came full circle for him. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5680.44s)]
*  And that's just one story of many in Justin's chapter where, you know, [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5682.44s)]
*  you just get put in these situations to either risk your life or save others or both. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5686.44s)]
*  And we have all these people in this country that make the right decision, even though it's a tough one. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5690.44s)]
*  That's Joey Jones. The book really pulls at your heartstrings behind the badge. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5695.44s)]
*  And you do get a lot out of this book. I'll tell you what I get out of your fantastic book. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5700.44s)]
*  Nothing that I complain about, have to deal with every day, compares to anything that these people have been through. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5705.44s)]
*  Nothing. And it really gives you perspective and hope and changes your mindset. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5711.44s)]
*  And I think that's at least part of the purpose of the book, is it not? [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5716.44s)]
*  That's exactly right. The lesson is simple. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5720.44s)]
*  The worst days of our lives. And I opened the book up talking about the night my dad fell on the floor lifeless. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5723.44s)]
*  And Armin came to work on him and kept him alive for another day so I could say bye to him. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5729.44s)]
*  And but the worst days of our lives is another shift for them. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5733.44s)]
*  But it's not benign to them. They carry that every time. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5737.44s)]
*  And a lot of times they don't know the outcome. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5740.44s)]
*  They sent my dad to the hospital and they must have. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5742.44s)]
*  And they went on back to the fire hall and probably had another call that night. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5744.44s)]
*  And so this idea that the worst days of our lives are another shift for them. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5747.44s)]
*  And we spent all this time talking about veterans mental health. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5751.44s)]
*  And we have a whole department of the government dedicated to fixing it. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5754.44s)]
*  Anything's on the table. Congress is voting on hallucinogens to help with it. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5757.44s)]
*  We're willing to do anything for veterans mental health. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5760.44s)]
*  And we don't take a moment to understand that these men and women that are first responders live in their battlefield. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5763.44s)]
*  They drive their kids to school through the same intersection that someone died in front of them that last night. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5770.44s)]
*  And their mental health is so important. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5775.44s)]
*  But we don't have a lot of resources for them so we can at least appreciate them. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5777.44s)]
*  Can we hold you over? [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5780.44s)]
*  Bottom of the hour. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5784.44s)]
*  Can we hold Joey over, Mr. Producer? [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5786.44s)]
*  The book is Joey Jones' book, Behind the Badge. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5789.44s)]
*  Go to Amazon.com, folks. You're going to love this book, Behind the Badge. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5792.44s)]

*  You can get a great book, Behind the Badge, by Joey Jones. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5807.44s)]
*  You've seen him on TV. Very compelling. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5810.44s)]
*  The book is very, very compelling. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5812.44s)]
*  Very, very helpful for your own mental state. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5814.44s)]
*  I can tell you that. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5816.44s)]
*  It's easy to get down about things that are good for you. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5818.44s)]
*  I can tell you that. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5821.44s)]
*  It's easy to get down about things that are going on and so forth. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5823.44s)]
*  And then when you realize what other people are going through, [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5826.44s)]
*  and maybe some of you are going through it too, and it can help you too, [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5829.44s)]
*  but you find your chin is up. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5834.44s)]
*  My wife tells me this all the time. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5836.44s)]
*  She says, put yourself in the shoes of other people. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5838.44s)]
*  This book reminds me of that, Behind the Badge. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5840.44s)]
*  Now, Joey, I'm sure you've mentioned this a thousand times, but not to my audience. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5843.44s)]
*  So give the public a little feel for where you grew up. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5846.44s)]
*  You grew up in a little town, USA. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5849.44s)]
*  I did. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5851.44s)]
*  I grew up in a town called Dalton, Georgia. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5853.44s)]
*  And some of your audience may know it, [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5855.44s)]
*  especially if they're in the business of building homes or anything like that. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5857.44s)]
*  That's where all the flooring is made. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5859.44s)]
*  All the carpet, pretty much in the world in the 90s and 2000s, [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5861.44s)]
*  was made in Dalton, Georgia. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5865.44s)]
*  Now they make all the flooring that people use for other things. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5867.44s)]
*  So if you didn't work in one of those carpet mills, you probably didn't have a job. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5869.44s)]
*  And thankfully, my dad didn't like being inside, so he was a brick and block mason. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5872.44s)]
*  So I grew up in farm country in northwest Georgia, foothills of the mountains, [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5876.44s)]
*  and laid brick and block outside and enjoyed every minute of it. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5880.44s)]
*  What caused you to join the Marines? [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5883.44s)]
*  Was there an event or it's just something you felt you wanted to do? [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5885.44s)]
*  You know, I was laying brick and block in July. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5888.44s)]
*  It was about 102 degrees, 103 degrees. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5891.44s)]
*  You know, my hands were bleeding. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5895.44s)]
*  Sweat was in my eyes. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5897.44s)]
*  And I thought, you know, if I'm going to work this hard and fill it this much, [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5899.44s)]
*  I might as well have a pretty uniform to show for it. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5902.44s)]
*  My best friends had been talking to me about the Marine Corps. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5904.44s)]
*  I knew it was the most difficult. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5906.44s)]
*  I didn't even want to go through the other services. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5908.44s)]
*  And really, you know, this is 2005. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5910.44s)]
*  So we're in the middle of the war. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5912.44s)]
*  We were recruiting really heavy. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5914.44s)]
*  And, you know, you go to the Air Force and like, hey, we'll give you a trade skill [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5916.44s)]
*  and a job you can use after service. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5919.44s)]
*  You go to the Navy, like, hey, you can have free medical for the rest of your life. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5920.44s)]
*  You go to the Army, like, hey, we'll give you the GI Bill. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5924.44s)]
*  You can go to college after. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5926.44s)]
*  I went to the Marine Corps and they said, you know what, you might have what it takes to be a Marine, [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5928.44s)]
*  but you're going to have to earn it and you're welcome to try. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5931.44s)]
*  And that's what I responded to. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5933.44s)]
*  And the Marine Corps was perfect for me. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5935.44s)]
*  It's interesting. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5937.44s)]
*  My grandfather, who was dirt poor, and he and his brother-in-law, [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5939.44s)]
*  when we were attacked at Pearl Harbor, they just went up and they signed up for Marines. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5945.44s)]
*  And boy, they got Iwo Jima, Guam, Guadalcanal, you know, tough. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5949.44s)]
*  And you know what's interesting? [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5955.44s)]
*  They wouldn't talk about it. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5957.44s)]
*  They never talked about it. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5960.44s)]
*  Yeah. Have you ever read the book with the old breed by Henry Sledge? [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5962.44s)]
*  No, but I'm sorry. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5966.44s)]
*  His son is Henry that just wrote a new book, but E.B. Sledge wrote it. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5969.44s)]
*  He's one of the guys they based the Pacific off of. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5972.44s)]
*  I'll get Henry to send you a copy of the book. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5975.44s)]
*  I'd love it. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5977.44s)]
*  He was Tarawa and Okinawa, but he served with guys that read Guadalcanal. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5978.44s)]
*  So it was a Pacific campaign. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5984.44s)]
*  And you know, I know we're on a tangent now, but I think your audience appreciate it. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5986.44s)]
*  We don't celebrate the Marines in the Pacific near enough. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5989.44s)]
*  We think about raising the flag on Iwo Jima, [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5992.44s)]
*  but we don't talk about the other islands and just how difficult they were [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5994.44s)]
*  and just how much those men fought. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5997.44s)]
*  You know, most of our hygiene in the Marine Corps today, we can't have a beard. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=5999.44s)]
*  And we go through all this extenuous hygiene now, even when we're in combat. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6002.44s)]
*  And it's because things were so tough on those islands that they lost a lot of Marines just to that, [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6006.44s)]
*  just a bad hygiene, the inability to escape it. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6012.44s)]
*  And so much of our warfare shaped from it. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6015.44s)]
*  And we're going back to it because we feel like China is the threat in the Pacific. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6018.44s)]
*  So our whole Marine Corps is oriented back from those direct lessons learned from your dad. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6022.44s)]
*  It's amazing. It's amazing. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6028.44s)]
*  We have an all volunteer military, isn't it? [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6030.44s)]
*  And now at least the number of the young people who sign up, guys like you, I got to tell you something. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6032.44s)]
*  I don't know if you know this years ago, I left a little voicemail on your phone. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6039.44s)]
*  I don't know you. I mean, I know you more now than I've ever talked to you, just to thank you. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6043.44s)]
*  And because watching you on TV, I mean, you lose part of your body. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6050.44s)]
*  You do something like that. That's a real man. That's a patriot. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6056.44s)]
*  You know, I can talk and I do my thing as best as I can do it. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6059.44s)]
*  But that's different. What you do is different. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6064.44s)]
*  And I will just tell you when I go to these military cemeteries, Arlington and so forth, I walked down and I look at these young guys who've died in its row after row after row. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6067.44s)]
*  And the American people, I think, do appreciate this very, very much, particularly those of us who don't serve, realize what guys like you have done. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6078.44s)]
*  And I want folks, I want you to go and get this book. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6088.44s)]
*  It's a damn good book. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6090.44s)]
*  Behind the Badge by Joey Jones. He's a good man. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6092.44s)]
*  Any final words, my friend? [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6095.44s)]
*  Hey, listen, you're a good man, too. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6097.44s)]
*  There's all kinds of ways to serve. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6099.44s)]
*  And I consider you very much a man of service. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6101.44s)]
*  And on the thought of those tombstones and those grays, they're just a bunch of the same. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6104.44s)]
*  You got to go and read the name to even tell them apart. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6108.44s)]
*  And it'll be my greatest honor when I die one day and become one of those tombstones. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6110.44s)]
*  I won't be a guy on TV or anything special. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6114.44s)]
*  I'll be one of those guys who's going to be a great man. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6117.44s)]
*  I'll be a guy on TV or anything special. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6119.44s)]
*  I'll be one of a hundred thousand and I'll be proud to be there. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6121.44s)]
*  Well, you're a good man. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6124.44s)]
*  God bless you, my friend. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6126.44s)]
*  You're welcome anytime. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6127.44s)]
*  Joey Jones, Behind the Badge. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6128.44s)]
*  Go get it, folks. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6130.44s)]
*  Amazon.com. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6132.44s)]
*  You take care of yourself. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6133.44s)]
*  Thank you, brother. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6134.44s)]
*  All right. God bless. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6136.44s)]
*  What a guy. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6138.44s)]
*  You know what I mean, Mr. producer? [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6139.44s)]
*  That's a man's man there. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6140.44s)]
*  I'll be right back. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6142.44s)]
*  What? [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6144.44s)]
*  Love in. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6145.44s)]
*  Let's go to Mark Chico, California, XM satellite. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6157.44s)]
*  Mark, how are you, sir? [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6160.44s)]
*  I'm very well, Mark. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6162.44s)]
*  Thank you for taking my call. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6164.44s)]
*  You got it. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6166.44s)]
*  That guy you just had on, John Jones, I was kind of feeling sorry for myself, but not anymore. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6167.44s)]
*  I'm scratching my throat. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6173.44s)]
*  But a couple of things. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6174.44s)]
*  Number one, the unreal lending attacks on the Trump administration and the Israelis in the last eight weeks continue today with the bomb damage assessment with the leak out of CNN. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6176.44s)]
*  And they see you saw the brief with Raising Cain. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6187.44s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6192.44s)]
*  The editorial in the Wall Street Journal, the very detailed analysis of how bad we hit him. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6193.44s)]
*  And of course, Victor David Hassons said today that they can't afford to rebuild. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6200.44s)]
*  So kudos to you, Mark, for your unreal any consistent support of Israel and our strategic and tactical efforts on behalf of the Israelis in the Mideast. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6204.44s)]
*  And and us. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6219.44s)]
*  And us get those damn things knocked out so they can't hit us. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6221.44s)]
*  Well, Hanson says today they can't afford to rebuild. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6226.44s)]
*  No, no, no, they can't afford to rebuild. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6230.44s)]
*  But before these events took place, they were they were a long way towards their intercontinental ballistic missile system with the help of the communist Chinese and the Russians. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6232.44s)]
*  All this needed to be taken out. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6243.44s)]
*  All of this needed to be taken out. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6244.44s)]
*  I don't know why it was controversial, but we have some isolationist ideologues, many of them, quite frankly, are anti-Semitic attacking Netanyahu. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6247.44s)]
*  They should be attacking the enemy, attacking the enemy. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6256.44s)]
*  And they're sitting there right now. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6259.44s)]
*  Many of these people, many of them are Democrats, media, others, the isolationists. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6260.44s)]
*  If anything happens, they want to point their finger at the president and me. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6265.44s)]
*  You know, we're dealing with Islamist Nazis. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6270.44s)]
*  Their mindset is to kill us. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6273.44s)]
*  They didn't need any provocation. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6275.44s)]
*  They tried to assassinate our president. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6277.44s)]
*  If they can get their shot at it, they'll do another 9-11 anyway. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6279.44s)]
*  Mark, you go ahead. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6282.44s)]
*  I was going to say that I went on Wikipedia today. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6284.44s)]
*  I thought you were the second coming of Stalin. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6287.44s)]
*  It's amazing, isn't it? [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6289.44s)]
*  It's just so it's so Wikipedia hates me. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6290.44s)]
*  And so they'll take everything every slimeball has to say and they will flop it up there, whether it's a Marxist, whether it's a Democrat, whether it's one of these anti-Semitic isolation, whatever they are, they flop it up there. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6296.44s)]
*  Never pay attention to Wikipedia. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6310.44s)]
*  Never. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6312.44s)]
*  It's completely I'm a lawyer, by the way, it's completely irrational. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6313.44s)]
*  And by the way, I know I'm not going to pipe in on this, but I love you fighting with Tucker. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6316.44s)]
*  He's gone off the deep end. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6321.44s)]
*  He's got like a tin hat on his head. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6322.44s)]
*  I don't get it. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6324.44s)]
*  But we're going to give him a little rest. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6325.44s)]
*  If they fire again, I will unleash holy hell. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6328.44s)]
*  But I think we've made our point. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6331.44s)]
*  If we need to make it again, we'll make it again and again and again and again. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6334.44s)]
*  That's the nature of the beast. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6337.44s)]
*  All right, Mark. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6340.44s)]
*  Thank you, buddy. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6341.44s)]

*  Thank you, Mark, for taking my call. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6351.44s)]
*  First off, I'm proud to be listening to your show on my birthday. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6353.44s)]

*  I don't hear very well. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6367.44s)]
*  Do I, Mr. Producer? [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6368.44s)]
*  No, seriously, years and years of these headphones. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6370.44s)]
*  I apologize deeply. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6372.44s)]

*  You're OK, Mr. Levin. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6375.44s)]
*  Look. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6378.44s)]
*  How old are you? [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6379.44s)]
*  Democrats are all the same. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6380.44s)]
*  I'm 15 years old, actually. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6382.44s)]
*  Wow. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6384.44s)]
*  That that is great. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6385.44s)]

*  Thank you. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6390.44s)]
*  So I'm actually a secretary of my school's young Republicans club. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6392.44s)]
*  And we've talked about this a lot over the course of our meetings. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6396.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6400.44s)]
*  And so these Democrats are all the same. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6401.44s)]
*  You're talking about Bernie Sanders and all. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6404.44s)]
*  And the real truth is they're all the same. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6407.44s)]
*  They all lie and cheat and steal for their own personal gain. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6409.44s)]
*  You look at what they're doing in New York, robbing innocent Americans here [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6413.44s)]
*  practically. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6417.44s)]
*  And you look at them bad mouthing Trump over him dropping the bombs in Iran. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6418.44s)]
*  Trump is one of the greatest peacemakers that we've had in our country. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6426.44s)]
*  If he hadn't have done that, I would have been the president of the United [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6432.44s)]
*  States. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6436.44s)]
*  I ran could have easily kept bombing Israel, would have gotten to a nuclear [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6437.44s)]
*  weapon and could have hurt anyone around the world. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6442.44s)]
*  Kyle, let me tell you something. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6446.44s)]
*  You should replace some of these podcast. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6449.44s)]
*  You are smart as can be. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6451.44s)]
*  You are wise as can be. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6454.44s)]
*  Articulate as can be. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6456.44s)]
*  And I'm going to tell you, I'm going to I'm going to make an exception, Mr. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6457.44s)]
*  Producer. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6459.44s)]
*  It's the only one we can do right now. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6460.44s)]
*  What should he cause? [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6461.44s)]
*  Full name and address. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6462.44s)]
*  As soon as my new book comes out, I want to sign one to him. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6463.44s)]
*  I want to get one. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6466.44s)]
*  So let's not lose his address. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6467.44s)]
*  Happy birthday there, buddy. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6468.44s)]
*  God bless you. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6470.44s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6471.44s)]
*  You take care of yourself. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6472.44s)]
*  God bless America. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6474.44s)]
*  You got it, baby. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6475.44s)]
*  What a nice young man. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6477.44s)]
*  Really terrific. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6479.44s)]
*  Congratulations to his parents. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6481.44s)]
*  Seriously. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6483.44s)]
*  All right, let's keep rolling. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6484.44s)]
*  Let's go to Jim Rustberg, Virginia on the March of the Dead. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6487.44s)]
*  Where is that, Jim? [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6492.44s)]
*  I know Virginia. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6493.44s)]
*  I don't know where that is. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6494.44s)]
*  About 12 miles from Lynchburg. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6495.44s)]
*  I know where that is. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6498.44s)]
*  OK, how are you doing? [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6500.44s)]
*  Liberty University. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6501.44s)]
*  Doing great. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6502.44s)]
*  But this time I've ever called you, but you are a patriot. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6503.44s)]
*  I've listened to you for years. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6507.44s)]
*  You stood up when no one would always stand and you didn't miss your work. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6509.44s)]
*  You stood up to fight. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6514.44s)]
*  You fought and you know what you called all of us to take rank and stand. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6516.44s)]
*  And take a place. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6521.44s)]
*  I'm an Air Force veteran. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6522.44s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6524.44s)]
*  But I want to thank you because what I want to say is that when it says if something is [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6525.44s)]
*  done in our nation, it should be done for all the states the same. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6531.44s)]
*  It doesn't matter what Democrat or Republican, we've got to start working as a nation. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6535.44s)]
*  And this thing about sanctuary is just completely against the law. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6542.44s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6548.44s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6549.44s)]
*  We're still not our country. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6550.44s)]
*  I've served five and a half years in Germany and I served four years as an electrician [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6552.44s)]
*  and four years as an integrated API on it and flight control and I'm saying what we [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6558.44s)]
*  fought for, we've got the communists in our own country and our own government. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6562.44s)]
*  And why is you a very intelligent person and Wilson also. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6567.44s)]
*  Why do we have people that can run for office in our country? [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6574.44s)]
*  Do you know I have friends Muslim thing, but this thing is a statehood. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6578.44s)]
*  It's totally against our nation and Constitution. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6583.44s)]
*  Now you're talking about these taxes I was talking about that for some reason we actually [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6587.44s)]
*  have conservatives and libertarians saying, you know what, these people, they live in [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6593.44s)]
*  these blue states and these purple states. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6597.44s)]
*  Screw them. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6599.44s)]
*  Screw them. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6600.44s)]
*  That's their problem. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6601.44s)]
*  They vote for these people. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6602.44s)]
*  Their property taxes are too high. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6603.44s)]
*  We're going to keep the deductions low. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6605.44s)]
*  And I said, what the hell are they talking about? [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6607.44s)]
*  We're individual citizens. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6609.44s)]
*  We happen to live wherever we live. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6610.44s)]
*  It's not about blue states and red states. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6612.44s)]
*  That's our money. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6614.44s)]
*  That's our money. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6616.44s)]
*  And it's better than we have it than the federal government have it. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6617.44s)]
*  So their whole thinking is perverse. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6620.44s)]
*  I'm in a minority on this and I don't really care. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6622.44s)]
*  That's my view, Jim. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6625.44s)]
*  You're not a minority when you're standing for what's right. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6627.44s)]
*  And when you're standing for what's right in the Lord, you'll never know what the Lord, [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6630.44s)]
*  your majority. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0wfGtrZ5M0&t=6635.44s)]
