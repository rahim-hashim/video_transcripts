Video Description: On Friday’s Mark Levin Show, there’s the horseshoe theory against Israel on Iran, which says that the radical left and right political ideologies, such as radical leftists (e.g., Communists, Islamists) and far-right groups (e.g., Klansmen, white supremacists, neo-Nazis, isolationists), converge in their views and actions, forming an alliance despite apparent differences. That’s why we see Bernie Sanders agree with Chatsworth Qatarlson (Tucker Carlson) and Steve Bannon. Bannon claims Mark Levin, Sean Hannity, Kayleigh McEnany, and Fox News should be investigated for supporting Israel. One would think he would be careful about saying who should be investigated after his past. Matt Gaetz is back saying that Israel doesn’t allow Arabs to vote, which is a flat-out lie.  As time goes on these people all reveal themselves as the crazy people they are with no loyalty to President Trump or MAGA. Also, Trump is a historic figure leading efforts to counter Iran's nuclear ambitions. Israel’s military actions, including destroying Iranian radar and weakening their defenses, make it easier for U.S. or Israeli forces to strike nuclear sites like Fordo. Americans are not warmongers or neo-cons. The American public supports these actions, rejects isolationism, and opposes being labeled warmongers by “fake MAGA” critics. Later, Gov Ron DeSantis calls in to explain Florida’s efforts to evacuate Americans in Israel. The state evacuated 1,500 people, including college students and families, with two planeloads of 160-170 passengers already returned to Tampa. He emphasized the emotional relief of families, particularly those with young children, and Florida’s commitment to continue the mission, utilizing resources like cruise ships to Cyprus for safe transport. DeSantis also discusses his push to reform property taxes in Florida, focusing on exempting primary residences (homesteaded properties) from property taxes. Homeowners don’t truly own their homes if they must continuously pay property taxes, as failure to pay could result in government seizure. Finally, Alexander Hamilton’s view of liberty and government contrasted sharply with that of Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, favoring a stronger, more centralized federal authority. While Madison, in Federalist No. 45, emphasized that the Constitution granted the federal government limited, defined powers—primarily over external affairs like war and foreign commerce—leaving broad authority to the states, Hamilton advocated for a more robust national government. At the Constitutional Convention, he proposed a powerful executive and legislature with lifelong terms, reflecting his preference for centralized control, though these ideas were swiftly rejected. Despite his role in co-authoring the Federalist Papers to support the Constitution’s ratification, Hamilton’s vision aligns with modern proponents of an activist government, contributing to his popularity among contemporary elites in media, politics, and academia, as evidenced by Hamilton the musical.

# The Battle Over Iran's Nuclear Threat
**The Mark Levin Show:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI)
*  Ladies and gentlemen, this next segment of the podcast is brought to you by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=0.0s)]
*  For over 50 years, the Great Heritage Foundation has been America's outpost in Washington, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4.8s)]
*  fighting against the D.C. federal bureaucracy and working to secure a future that allows Americans [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=9.52s)]
*  to live the good life. For too long, common sense principles have been ignored by many of the very [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=14.64s)]
*  leaders claiming to fight for America, but the Heritage Foundation is proud to hold our leaders [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=19.28s)]
*  accountable and stand up for America's founding principles, paid for by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=23.6s)]
*  He's here. Now, broadcasting from the underground command post, deep in the bowels of a hidden [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=30.48s)]
*  bunker, somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=38.0s)]
*  we once again make contact with our leader, Mark LeVein. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  On April 18th, 1983, Ronald Reagan was wakened with a word that a car bomb went off at the U.S. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=120.88s)]
*  Embassy in Beirut, killing five U.S. Marines. Of the ceremony held in the Marines' honor five [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=128.64s)]
*  days later, President Reagan wrote in his diary, I was too choked up to speak. But later that day, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=133.84s)]
*  while delivering a radio address to the nation on the bombing, President Reagan said, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=138.72s)]
*  We don't know yet who bears responsibility for this terrible deed. What we do know is that the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=142.4s)]
*  terrorists who planned and carried out this cynical and cowardly attack have failed in their [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=148.56s)]
*  purpose. They mistakenly believe that if they're cruel enough and violent enough, they will weaken [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=154.0s)]
*  American resolve and deter us from our effort to help build a lasting and secure peace in the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=160.4s)]
*  Middle East. But if they think that, they don't know too much about America. The great Ronald [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=165.76s)]
*  Reagan. The great Ronald Reagan. A lot of crazy going out there today, America. Welcome to the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=173.84s)]
*  program, our Friday program, where we keep our foot on the gas pedal here. We don't know any other [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  way. A lot of crazy out there. John Stewart, aka Leibowitz, says he agrees with Chatsworth-Katarlson. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=187.52s)]
*  I'm not surprised. You know, there's a lot of talk, a lot of writing about what they call [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=198.96s)]
*  the horseshoe. Think about a horseshoe. Think about the upper end of the left horseshoe. At the top, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=204.08s)]
*  it's open, but the upper left. And you have the radical left, the communists, the Islamists, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  people like that. Then think of the going around the horseshoe back up to the right, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=215.44s)]
*  at the top of the right. And then you have the Islamists, excuse me, then you have the the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=220.32s)]
*  Klansmen, the white supremacists, the neo-Nazis, and the isolationists. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=225.36s)]
*  And the point of the horseshoe is that they are in bed together now. So that's why a Bernie Sanders [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=231.52s)]
*  and a Tlaib and a John Leibowitz sound like a, you know, Chatsworth-Katarlson or Steve Bonin [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  and people like that. Did you see Mr. Producer? Steve Bonin thinks I and Sean and [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=247.84s)]
*  Kayleigh McEnany, a wonderful lady, and all the Fox should be investigated by the government for [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=258.0s)]
*  supporting Israel. Did you see that? I guess we should all be thrown in prison. The point of an [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=263.44s)]
*  investigation, right, is to prosecute and throw people in prison. I wrote to myself, wow, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=269.59999999999997s)]
*  I think that's a great idea. I think that's a great idea. I think that's a great idea. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=276.15999999999997s)]
*  Imagine that. Imagine that. Can you imagine that, ladies and gentlemen? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=280.32s)]
*  This guy's always looked to me sort of like Rosie O'Donnell in pants, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=287.68s)]
*  just saying, as he sits there slobbering all over himself. He used to make some sense to me, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=291.36s)]
*  but over time, he makes very little sense. Now, he was wrongly put in prison in my view, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=299.03999999999996s)]
*  when the January 6 group and the Biden regime went after him. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=304.32s)]
*  I happened to support him. I openly supported him. I openly defended him, but loyalty is a funny [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=309.44s)]
*  thing. So now I should be investigated. Sean should be investigated. Kayleigh McEnany should [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=314.4s)]
*  be investigated. All the Fox should be investigated. I guess they'll throw Jack Keenan there and Brian [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=319.59999999999997s)]
*  Killamede. You know, got to have a list and check it twice. Wow. I wonder if he's a special suit, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=325.12s)]
*  you know, a German suit from the 1930s. Now, I don't even think the Germans made suits that big [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  for a guy of his husk, but you never know. You never know. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=341.68s)]
*  Let's see here. I'm trying to find one minute, ladies and gentlemen. Didn't he plead guilty? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=347.76s)]
*  Yes. I'm not going to pull all this up. You folks can look on the internet yourself. He pled guilty [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=358.64s)]
*  to one or more offenses involving, I believe it was fundraising for a wall. Remember that, Mr. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=363.36s)]
*  Reducer? And what happened? He pled guilty, multiple charges. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=370.08000000000004s)]
*  I think it was a charity that was set up, something like that. I mean, I can go in and [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=377.36s)]
*  dig it all up. I'm doing this by memory. You would think you'd be careful about saying which people [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=380.24s)]
*  should be investigated and I guess prosecuted and I guess thrown in prison by the government. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=387.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, I can think of a way to do that. I mean, I think it's a good idea to do that. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=393.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, I can think of another one. How about Chatsworth, Cattarleton? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=398.64000000000004s)]
*  Qatar, Putin. I mean, these are enemies, right? Israel's an ally. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=403.28000000000003s)]
*  Or him. What about China? Oh, I do know, Steve. That's right. China. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=408.88000000000005s)]
*  As time goes on, as time goes on, these people reveal themselves as crazy as bat crap. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=417.04s)]
*  That's what they are. They have no loyalty, no loyalty to the president, no loyalty to MAGA. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=425.76000000000005s)]
*  They are absolute reprobates, in my humble opinion, of course. But now we've reached a point where one [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=432.24s)]
*  of them thinks we should be investigated because we support the Jewish state of Israel. He claims [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=438.72s)]
*  to support it too, you see. Funny though, he just doesn't think they should be able to defend [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=445.04s)]
*  themselves. Or if we participate in taking out a nuclear site because these bastards want to [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=451.6s)]
*  slaughter us too, well then you should be investigated. So I guess 80% of the American [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=456.16s)]
*  people should be investigated. 84% of Republicans in one poll, 90% of MAGA should be investigated [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=461.2s)]
*  under another poll. So what kind of world does this guy live in? He's a racist. He's a racist. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=469.36s)]
*  Under another poll. So what kind of world does this guy live in? One with padded walls, I think. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=477.28s)]
*  I'm not going to spend any more time on this unless I get an inkling to do it, as the course, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=485.28s)]
*  as the show goes on. There's always Monday through Friday, Monday through Friday, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=489.2s)]
*  52 weeks a year, three hours a day. These fools don't get it, man. They just don't. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=496.96s)]
*  And of course, Mediocreite, which attracts his ilk and loves to get comments from all kinds of [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=501.20000000000005s)]
*  really sick people. They thought this was a big story. They ran with a headline. So in poor the [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=506.64000000000004s)]
*  Jew haters, in poor the neo-Nazis providing their comments, cheering this stuff on, because they [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=514.64s)]
*  need those clicks. They rely on those clicks. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=521.6800000000001s)]
*  That's what they rely on. But when you start to see the ugly underbelly [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=527.1999999999999s)]
*  of the Chatsworth-Katarlsons, of the Stephen Bannons, I'll come up with a nickname. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=532.7199999999999s)]
*  He does remind me of Rosie O'Donnell, though. He really does. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=537.76s)]
*  Or I'll think of another name. I'll figure out a name. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=543.68s)]
*  And you start to watch. Matt Gaetz is back. Wow. And his little producer. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=546.88s)]
*  Matt Gaetz is out there. Remember him? Remember the ethics compli- these guys are seedy, sleazy. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=551.92s)]
*  Remember him? Remember the ethics investigation? Remember Ali won after [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=562.4799999999999s)]
*  the former speaker because he wanted that ethics investigation killed? I really can't blame him. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=567.12s)]
*  That's right. I really can't blame him. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=573.12s)]
*  Sleazeball. Complete sleazeball. So he posts about Israel not allowing Arabs to vote. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=576.08s)]
*  You know, that whole apartheid thing. The problem is in Israel, they do allow Arabs to vote. There's [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=586.08s)]
*  two million of them. They vote. They participate in government. They're elected to the Knesset. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=590.08s)]
*  They're judges. They're in the military. It's not that Matt Gaetz ever knew what he was talking about. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=595.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Another weirdo. Quite funny. It's a whole cabala. That's like this Marjorie Teller-Green. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=602.72s)]
*  Marjorie Teller-Green. See all the friends I'm making? They hate my guts anyway. Marjorie Teller-Green. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=615.0400000000001s)]
*  I don't think there's anybody more profound than her. Do you, Mr. Producer? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=623.0400000000001s)]
*  Nobody speaks as articulately, posts so intelligently as I think they call her MTG, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=626.88s)]
*  just like AOC. She has her own initials. So I'm going to have a mass swearing in here, Mr. Producer, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=635.12s)]
*  to Fatty's United. Some of these individuals are fat. Some of them are not. Doesn't matter anymore. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=645.52s)]
*  We've decided to diversify. Although in the case of Steve-O, with that Rosie O'Donnell look at his, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=652.64s)]
*  he fits the mark. So I want to welcome them all to FU. FU, Fatty's United. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=662.1600000000001s)]
*  Bannon, Gaetz, MTG. But we do have our standards, so we're not going to allow [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=669.76s)]
*  Chatsworth Cattarleson into our program. No. No. Can't have somebody who probably stabbed the pilot [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=677.28s)]
*  in the back. You know, we have our special plane and so forth. In fact, let's do this. Isn't there [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=684.8000000000001s)]
*  that comedian? What is that comedian's name, Rich? That we have the audio for? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=690.0s)]
*  Rich listening to the program? I think he is. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=698.32s)]
*  This guy is funny. And I posted this. He's now making a career off of [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=700.16s)]
*  Chatsworth Cattarleson. We'll play this. Then we'll get down to business. We've got a lot, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=712.3199999999999s)]
*  a lot to talk about. Go. I mean, well, it's very obvious. It's clear to me that the government of [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=717.36s)]
*  Israel is trolling our politicians. There's no question. And I can't support that as an American, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=725.52s)]
*  as a Christian. I can't get behind that. And you think it's too much influence? AIPAC has enormous [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=730.64s)]

*  I don't think it is. Didn't you support Donald Trump? Of course I did. Yes, I campaigned for him. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=741.76s)]
*  And you know, he's been very pro-Israel. He supports Israel. Doesn't that mean by extension, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=745.4399999999999s)]
*  you support Israel? Why does that? It doesn't mean that at all. Like at all. Why would you support [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=749.84s)]
*  Donald Trump if he supported Israel? Why would you do that? I don't see why you would do that [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=753.68s)]

*  supporting a candidate who proudly supports Israel. I would think he would support Israel. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=762.8s)]

*  I can get past that. You're supporting proudly a leader who's been proudly supportive of Israel. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=771.68s)]
*  And now you're saying you don't support that president? That seems contradictory. Well, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=775.8399999999999s)]
*  I do want him to succeed, but do I want him to fail? I mean, failure can be good for people. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=779.36s)]
*  People can learn a lot from failure. I certainly have learned a lot from failure, but why would [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=784.64s)]

*  it's speaking out of both sides of your mouth. I mean, do you have two mouths? I don't know. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=790.32s)]

*  Didn't we condemn Biden and his regime for going after people, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=997.4399999999999s)]
*  for expressing their opinions, pro-lifers, Catholics, others, and then this slob, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1003.4399999999999s)]
*  excuse me, and then Steve basically picks up where they left off. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1009.04s)]
*  I guess he's probably downing. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1013.28s)]
*  Really kind of crazy, but he has this massive podcast. Everybody's watching every day. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1016.16s)]
*  I know millions and millions of viewers. You don't even know who he is. And you're [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1021.52s)]
*  wondering, what are you talking about, Mark? Well, look, it's important that I make some [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1024.72s)]
*  of these people famous. Oh yeah. Especially if they're going to say that Fox should be [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1027.76s)]
*  investigated and they start listing Kayleigh McEnany. Don't you like Kayleigh McEnany? She's [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1034.8s)]
*  as sweet as can be. Sean Hannity should be investigated. I should be investigated. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1039.2s)]
*  He's just getting started. He's getting worked up, you know, and I love the way they say, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1043.12s)]
*  I'm serious because they know they're not. They're not serious people, but I am. I'm really serious. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1048.2399999999998s)]
*  Good for you, moron. I mean, Steve, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1054.0s)]
*  but I'm looking at it. You can all Google this yourself. You don't need me to read it to you. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1058.3999999999999s)]
*  It's not very pleasant. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1062.7199999999998s)]
*  And again, I'm sympathetic with him for what they did to him with this January 6th stuff. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1066.0s)]
*  That was outrageous. As you know, I defended him and I condemned what they were doing to him, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1069.68s)]
*  as well as others who are friends or acquaintances. But this guy's known for stabbing people in the [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1076.0800000000002s)]
*  back, whether it's Trump or me or somebody else. That's what he does. He's just speaking the truth, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1081.8400000000001s)]
*  truth to power. More like cook the power. We come back, President Trump sounds like he's about had [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1087.6000000000001s)]
*  it with Tulsi Gabbard. I'm not putting words in his mouth. I'm going to let you hear what he has [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1096.48s)]
*  to say. He's not flinching about it. I think he's he's furious about it. That's the way it seems to [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1100.08s)]
*  be with me. You know, I was the first one to point out that in March, she gave testimony in front of [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1108.56s)]
*  a committee under the penalty of perjury. And she said, No, the Iranians are not really working [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1113.52s)]
*  anymore and weaponizing their nuclear material. They're spinning centrifuges. And I played the [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1118.16s)]
*  head of CENTCOM who said, Oh, yes, they are. And I said, Well, we're going to believe Gabbard, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1125.04s)]
*  are we going to believe the head of CENTCOM? And I said, Obviously, the head of CENTCOM. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1132.0s)]
*  Now, she's the national director of the national, the hell do they call it, the director of national [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1135.68s)]
*  intelligence. She's in head of the whole thing. And she gave that information. And I think Trump [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1141.2s)]
*  feels like he was horribly misled on such a crucial issue. But we'll play his own comments. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1145.84s)]
*  We'll be right back. Are you concerned about the rising number of judges who've been limiting [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1151.12s)]
*  President Trump's executive orders? Now, if you're not concerned yet, you should be when these judges [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1159.6799999999998s)]

*  Of course I notice. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1226.72s)]
*  I've told you many times, President Trump is a historic and iconic figure. I think this [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1227.6799999999998s)]
*  situation in Iran, given in part Iran, the Islamic Nazi regime there is going to result in [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1234.56s)]
*  a role that we will have extraordinarily limited in knocking out at least one of these nuclear sites. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1244.8799999999999s)]
*  The American people understand this. The American people are not warmongers, and I'm sick and tired [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1251.2s)]
*  of the American people being called warmongers and neocons and all kinds of names by these [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1255.2s)]
*  reprobates and these fake MAGA people. The American people do not support the Islamic [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1259.6s)]
*  Nazi regime in Tehran. They support the democratic government in Israel. The American people do not [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1267.84s)]
*  support isolationism. They want those sites taken out by Israel or by us. One of those sites, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1275.2s)]
*  quite frankly, cannot be taken up by Israel. They don't have the bombs and the bombers. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1281.3600000000001s)]
*  It's a tiny country. They don't have them, but they're doing a hell of a job with everything [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1287.3600000000001s)]
*  they've got, and they will make it much easier. Our bombers, they're not going to be taken out [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1292.96s)]
*  by Israel. They will be taken out by us. Should we, and I believe we will, and I have no inside [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1300.32s)]
*  information, taking out one or more of these nuclear sites, we'll have an absolute clean palette. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1307.76s)]
*  There will be nothing in the sky to stop them, no jets, no air-to-ground missile systems, nothing. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1314.24s)]
*  The Israelis have also been wiping up all the radar systems that they have as well. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1320.6399999999999s)]
*  So for those flying these jets, it's always dangerous, these bombers. It's always dangerous. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1325.1200000000001s)]
*  Don't get me wrong, but it'll be less dangerous by far than it otherwise would have been, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1329.76s)]
*  but for what the Israelis are doing. Now, when these nuclear sites are taken out, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1334.56s)]
*  including this Forte site that is way underground, you, me, we, the American people, can take a sigh [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1341.1200000000001s)]

*  if not thousands, and maimed thousands more all over the world, all over the world, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1352.8s)]

*  That's a great ally that helps us do that, and that's Israel. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1365.28s)]
*  These people who don't support taking out these nuclear sites or don't support our [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1371.12s)]
*  involvement if the Israelis don't have the capacity to take out one of them, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1376.1599999999999s)]
*  they're doing a favor to the Islamist Nazi regime in Iran, because if it's not taken out, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1381.36s)]

*  line. Some of them are out of the closet. Some of them are highly un-American. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1392.08s)]
*  While they pretend to support the troops, they're defending a country that has murdered many of our [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1396.8s)]
*  troops. And that's the troop. They say they're against forever war, but they're not going to [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1401.76s)]
*  do it. They say they're against forever wars, and the Israelis are trying to end a forever war. And [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1409.28s)]
*  basically, they defeated the Iranian military in 48 hours. Everything they said would happen [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1415.92s)]
*  never happened. Not a single Arab country is participating on the side of Iran. Why would they? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1420.24s)]
*  Iran's not Arab. Iran threatens most of its neighbors, and Iran's a loser. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1425.76s)]
*  Finally, this tiny little country got up and punched a bully in the nose and said, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1435.52s)]
*  no more killing, no more raping. You don't get to hide behind Hamas and hide behind Hezbollah [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1439.28s)]
*  and the Houthis. That's over. We're not putting up with it anymore. But most of the people who [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1444.48s)]
*  oppose Israel and support the enemy, they're bullies themselves, but they're paper tigers. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1450.24s)]
*  If you really look at them, who the hell are they? What do they have? Nothing. The internet [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1454.56s)]
*  has the... It sort of creates an impression, a false impression, that many of these people [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1461.68s)]
*  have all kinds of followings. To the extent they have a following, it's an inch deep. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1468.0800000000002s)]
*  It's an inch deep. They always have to rely on millionaires and billionaires to subsidize them. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1472.48s)]
*  Always. We don't have to do that here, do we, Mr. Producer? We either have ratings or we don't. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1478.24s)]
*  No. And our ratings are killer right now. Killer. So here's President Trump on the tarmac in [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1485.28s)]
*  Marstown, New Jersey today. Cut to Mr. Producer, nice and loud. Here we go. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1494.56s)]
*  What intelligence do you have that Iran is building a nuclear weapon? Your intelligence [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1499.76s)]
*  community has said they have no evidence that they are at this point. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1503.28s)]
*  Well, then my intelligence community is wrong. Who in the intelligence community said that? [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1506.32s)]
*  Your Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1511.12s)]
*  She's wrong. Folks, the evidence is overwhelming. It has been overwhelming. And now [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1514.0s)]
*  the whole mask has been torn off of it. The Israelis are bombing these nuclear sites. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1523.2s)]
*  Cut three, Mr. Producer. Go. And it looked like I'm right about [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1528.48s)]
*  the material that they've gathered already. It's a tremendous amount of material. And I think within [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1533.76s)]
*  a matter of weeks or certainly within a matter of months, they're going to be able to have a [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1539.12s)]
*  nuclear weapon. We can't let that happen. I don't even know the 1930s isolationists. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1543.04s)]
*  Say what you will about Charles Lindbergh, who was way off and really helped to [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1549.92s)]
*  make sure that the public wasn't prepared psychologically or any other way for the [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1557.76s)]
*  attack that occurred on Pearl Harbor and so forth. He apologized later. He led the bond effort and so [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1561.36s)]
*  forth. And so I don't think the isolationists today have the integrity of a Charles Lindbergh. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1567.84s)]
*  I don't think they have anywhere close to the integrity of a Charles Lindbergh. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1576.1599999999999s)]
*  Even when you provide them with evidence, even when our President of the United States, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1580.0s)]
*  who's very hesitant to use the military, even when he says it's overwhelming and so forth, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1585.84s)]
*  and these aid and cheese are coming out, they're actually producing lots of material that you can [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1591.36s)]
*  find online. They deny it. So what are we to make of these people? They're liars. That's what you [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1594.64s)]
*  make of these people. They're liars. And they're undermining our president. They're undermining the [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1599.44s)]
*  policies that he is developing over time. And ultimately, if our military goes and they're [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1605.2800000000002s)]
*  going to claim they support it while they're undermining it, that's what they'll do. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1609.6000000000001s)]
*  War President Trump cut for Mr. Producer. Go. Would you support Iran being able to have [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1618.96s)]
*  civilian nuclear energy capabilities up to 3.76%? I don't know who's asking these questions, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1624.08s)]
*  quite frankly, but the answers are well known. Civilian capacity up to 3.76%. That's the Obama [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1629.6s)]
*  deal. That's what Obama agreed to. And what happened? Iranians went up to 87%. 90% is bingo. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1638.0s)]
*  And now it turns out they did that too. They have produced enough, as the president is saying, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1647.12s)]
*  fiesel material at a level, at a purified level, that can be used in a nuclear weapon. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1651.8400000000001s)]
*  Now the CIA Director, John Radcliffe, I think we all respect him, don't we? He didn't plead [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1660.48s)]
*  guilty to any felonies or anything like that. No, he's a man with a great integrity. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1667.68s)]
*  And he said they're on the one yard line. And if they decide to score a goal, they can do it in two weeks. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1672.8799999999999s)]
*  Two weeks. Two weeks. And still the isolationists say, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1682.8799999999999s)]
*  Investigate Hannity, investigate Kayleigh, investigate Levin, investigate Fox. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1692.08s)]
*  The Israelis are dragging us into this and so forth and so on. If these sites are taken out, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1698.72s)]
*  we are protected from a nuclear Iran, as well as the rest of the world, and yes, the Israelis. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1706.24s)]
*  What is it? Only we should be protected, only the rest. I don't even understand this thinking. It's [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1713.36s)]
*  so bizarre. President Trump, I have nothing but the greatest admiration for him. Nothing. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1717.44s)]
*  And he's always very kind. He's very forgiving of all these reprobates and so forth. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1727.76s)]
*  Tucker, who's a renowned weasel, you know, he apparently has apologized over and over again [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1733.6s)]
*  to the Commander in Chief. I explained this the other day. It's hard for the isolationists [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1741.84s)]
*  to comprehend. It's hard for the media, who are desperate for controversy. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1746.96s)]
*  You can disagree with the President. I've disagreed with several presidents. I disagree [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1752.8799999999999s)]
*  with Reagan on amnesty. You can do it politely. You can voice your concern. You can write your [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1756.8s)]
*  concern, that so forth and so on. But if your goal is really, really to kneecap, to harm, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1760.8799999999999s)]
*  to usurp, to undermine a president who you love and support, that is a whole different ballgame. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1768.0s)]
*  That's like having a disagreement with a spouse. All right, honey, we disagree. That's fine. Or [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1774.32s)]
*  or trying to destroy your spouse's reputation. You're trying to handicap your spouse. It's two [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1780.72s)]
*  different things. And the media have a very difficult time comprehending it. The Daily Wire, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1786.9599999999998s)]
*  this guy, I think his name is Sperling. I don't know much about him. He literally takes... Look, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1792.72s)]
*  if I post something, it's in my words, with my sentences, in the order that I write it, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1800.0s)]
*  for a reason. So when the Daily... What is it called, that British paper? I forget. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1806.72s)]
*  The Daily Mail. That's what I meant. Thank you, Rich. When the Daily Mail, and this guy, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1813.76s)]
*  Charlie Sperling or whatever his name is, literally takes what I wrote, [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1817.28s)]
*  moves the sentences around, and then has me attacking Donald Trump. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1821.28s)]
*  But Charlie, I'll call you Chuck, because it rhymes with schmuck. Hey, Chuck, I'm on to you. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1828.08s)]
*  It doesn't affect the President of the United States one iota. He knows you guys are fake. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1835.1200000000001s)]
*  It really doesn't. We've had these discussions. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1839.68s)]
*  But why do you have to do that? If you want to follow me, stalk me, and write about me, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1844.24s)]
*  then convey what I wrote. Don't change it around and change the meaning. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1853.2s)]
*  We've had this done with mediaite. What is with these people? Well, they're corrupt. That's what [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1858.72s)]
*  with these people. And we'll keep calling them out. That's what... I think we have a responsibility [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1867.3600000000001s)]
*  here, given the nature of this platform. Anyway, here's Donald Trump. You know, this statement is [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1875.04s)]
*  so important. I think we're going to wait until after the break, Mr. Producer Number 5. We'll be [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1882.56s)]
*  right back. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1886.64s)]
*  President Trump is in Washington with a mandate from the American people to solve the border [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1895.2s)]
*  crisis, reverse the effects of Bidenflation, and restore American greatness. But since January 20, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1899.68s)]
*  judges across our country have consistently been blocking President Trump's attempts to [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1905.44s)]
*  fulfill his mandate. The Heritage Foundation has been analyzing the situation, and they've been [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1910.16s)]

*  Wow. Unbelievable. We've always loved him on my various programs. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1966.24s)]
*  But by definition, from the fifth column isolationist, he's a warmongered neocon, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1971.28s)]
*  and by the man who pleaded guilty to crimes, that would be Rosie O'Donnell Bannon, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1978.24s)]
*  he should be investigated for his support of Israel, you see. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=1984.96s)]

*  Producer? I think he could tell us everything about Qatar. Oh, yeah, probably the name of the [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2004.0s)]
*  five inbreds who run the country. Most of us don't know their names. The number of people they [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2010.96s)]
*  enslaved from India and Nepal and so forth and in that worker's paradise. Sure. Probably knows the [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2016.8799999999999s)]
*  gross domestic product. A lot of people know the GDP of Qatar. They spread their money around. They [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2024.16s)]
*  make it their business. I'm sure Chadsworth Katarlson could tell you all about various [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2031.8400000000001s)]

*  Does Iran have two weeks or could you strike before that? Are you essentially giving them [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2085.2s)]
*  a two week timeline? Giving them a period of time. We're going to see what that period of time is, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2088.96s)]
*  but I'm giving them a period of time and I would say two weeks would be the maximum. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2092.64s)]
*  We've always given a hint there. And the reason is, I think, is because again, the Islamo-Nazi regime [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2099.68s)]
*  has told the president to screw up. That there's not going to be an unconditional surrender, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2105.2s)]

*  two weeks to discuss that. Do you, America? But even more importantly than that, doesn't that [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2117.8399999999997s)]
*  demonstrate their mindset? To me, it undermines the whole idea of a deal. A parchment deal, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2124.56s)]
*  a parchment deal, as Scalia would put it, or a paper deal. That is, they sign a deal, [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2130.88s)]
*  but they're never going to give it up. Period. Ever. Never. Remember, these are seventh century [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2135.2000000000003s)]
*  primitive barbarian throwbacks. That's what they are. And they need to hold on to this in order to [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2140.7200000000003s)]
*  hold on to the regime. Oh, and then that's the next. You support regime change. You support [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2146.48s)]
*  regime change. Nobody's talking about a democracy progress. The president, certainly I'm not either, [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2151.6s)]
*  talking about troops on the ground. But what if there is a regime change? But will it be worse [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2156.48s)]
*  than what's there? Mr. Bidusse, you have Islamo-Nazis from the seventh century trying to make 20 to 25,000 [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2161.44s)]
*  ballistic missiles who have the capacity within two weeks to make 10 nuclear bombs. Can there be a [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2170.32s)]
*  worse regime? And what would that look like? But listen to these reporters. Not a negative thing [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2176.56s)]
*  about the regime. Why do you think they're not coming to the table? They're on their backs. Why [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2185.92s)]
*  do you think they're conducting themselves this way? How can the reporters don't ask questions like that? [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2190.32s)]
*  It's incredible, isn't it? [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2197.04s)]
*  Yes, it is. I'll say so myself. All right. How much time left, Mr. Bidusse? I gotta get, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2201.12s)]
*  all right, I gotta get our thing in here. Hold on. I'm trying to find, here we go. And by the way, [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2208.48s)]
*  when we come back, you're going to hear the Islamo-Nazi foreign minister. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2215.2s)]
*  Well, the foreign minister of Iran, who apparently is still alive, says, no go. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2220.72s)]
*  Okay. You see the way I see it? Three words. We surrender unconditionally. Doesn't take two weeks. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2229.12s)]
*  Doesn't take two minutes. It's three words, right, Mr. Bidusse? Three words. Now, this should help [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2236.48s)]
*  explain to Tulsi Gabbard and others why Truman dropped two atomic bombs on Japan, because Japan [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2243.04s)]
*  refused to surrender. And President Truman wanted to end what could have been a forever war. You see, [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2249.44s)]
*  the guys that talk about forever wars, ending them, don't really want to end them. It's bizarre. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2257.6s)]
*  I think this war that Iran has unleashed against us, the free world, Israel, [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2265.44s)]
*  almost half a century, is probably the longest forever war other than the Cold War. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2273.2s)]
*  Israel's ending the forever war. Israel has defeated the Iranian military in 48 hours. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2278.8s)]
*  The issue is getting to this really last nuclear center. And what do the fifth column isolationists [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2285.7599999999998s)]
*  say? We and MAGA and the president do not want to do that. We're not warmongers. We're peacemakers. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2292.88s)]
*  He campaigned on this. Excuse me. We don't want to do what? Take out the nuclear site? [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2300.48s)]
*  You see, ladies and gentlemen, you and I, we're not suicidal. They are. And they seek to drag us with [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2310.32s)]
*  them. It's not going to fly. We have a president who's not going to do it. He's not going to go [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2317.6s)]
*  along with this insanity. And he's putting his foot down. And in his due course, this will be [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2321.12s)]

*  somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building, we once again make contact with our [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2360.16s)]
*  leader, Mark Levin. Hello America, Mark Levin here. Our number, 877-381-3811. 877-381-3811. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2366.24s)]
*  Remember folks this, it's very interesting. I talk and write for a living. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2381.04s)]
*  What I say doesn't have to be rewritten or edited by individuals who sit at their desks [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2390.24s)]
*  behind their computers, sometimes with pants, sometimes not. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2398.0s)]
*  You try to put words in my mouth, or try to draw conclusions and project their own opinions and so [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2403.2s)]
*  forth. If you want to know what I say, go to marklevinshow.com and the archive is there for [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2408.72s)]
*  over four years of shows, starting of course with the most recent. If you want to read what I say [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2414.8799999999997s)]
*  online, just go to my various social sites. It's right there. If you want to know what I said on [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2420.9599999999996s)]
*  Fox, you go to Fox, you can DVR it and you can watch and hear what I say. It's very strange, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2426.48s)]
*  these sort of entrails of journalism, or entrails of something, [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2434.96s)]
*  that they take what you say, they repackage it, they put historical headlines on, often misleading, [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2443.68s)]
*  they know what words will grab attention, they work very hard with marketing firms and PR firms [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2451.68s)]
*  to figure out what kind of fonts to use and how to set up their websites, and they spend a lot of [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2458.7200000000003s)]
*  money on this. The goal is to get as many clicks as they can, many clicks as they can. There aren't [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2462.88s)]
*  really newspapers anymore. I mean, you can get newspapers, but that's not where they make their [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2470.08s)]
*  money anymore. That's not how they do it. And so they have these websites, they have these platforms, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2473.76s)]
*  and they're able to get advertising based on how many eyes are said to be there. So they have to be [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2484.0s)]
*  as provocative as possible. And if that means lying and distorting, then that's what they'll do. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2489.84s)]
*  It means taking the guts out of what somebody says and trying to create controversy. That is what they [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2497.84s)]
*  will do. Now I could sit here and talk about Aristotle. We've done that. Talk about Alexander [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2502.2400000000002s)]
*  Hamilton. I've done that. We're going to do more of that one day. Talk about power and the breakup [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2511.44s)]
*  of power and how power works, positive power, negative power. You won't see one story on that. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2517.04s)]
*  They'll say that's not news, but what is news is what we repackage what you say. That's news. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2522.64s)]
*  You hear people say all the time, thank God for these new news outlets. The problem is [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2530.88s)]
*  too many, not all, not all, but too many of these new news outlets are no better than the old news [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2536.96s)]
*  outlets just with different technological platforms and with people who are literally stupid, stupid. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2542.88s)]
*  So when you read something, you said there's no way Donald Trump said that. He probably never said [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2555.28s)]
*  it. There's no way Mark Levin said that. And I probably never said it. Oh, look at this. Mark [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2562.6400000000003s)]
*  Levin and Donald Trump are fighting. That'll never be true. I'll give my opinion. It might always [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2568.56s)]
*  not be in lockstep with the administration. I mean, when I worked for the Reagan administration, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2574.24s)]
*  my opinions weren't always in lockstep. But again, the goal is not to sink the ship. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2579.12s)]
*  The goal is not to cause damage. The goal is to be helpful. My opinion might be a positive contribution [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2584.0s)]
*  to the administration on those occasions, and they're not often, or I might disagree with the [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2592.16s)]
*  administration. I'm accused most of all being a suck up to the administration, of being a mouthpiece [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2597.8399999999997s)]
*  for the administration, except apparently when I'm not. Here's the Iranian foreign minister [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2604.0s)]
*  for the Islamonazi regime in Tehran, the translator. I think he's abundantly clear for the four [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2610.96s)]
*  billionth time, despite the fact that the fifth column isolationists and their embeds [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2617.36s)]
*  keep wanting that. You know, they want to drag this along, just like our enemy wants to drag it along. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2625.6800000000003s)]
*  I spoke to my wonderful wife, Julie, the other night. I said, you know what's interesting about this? [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2632.96s)]
*  People like Katarlson, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2640.08s)]
*  Rosie O'Donnell Bannon, and the others, they really want us to fail. They want the Israelis [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2642.0s)]
*  to fail. They want the Israelis to kick their asses. But what if we actually take out one or [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2649.76s)]
*  more of these sites with one of our bombers and bombs? And again, these people are proven wrong. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2655.92s)]
*  They're going to be very disappointed. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2665.28s)]
*  They're going to be very disappointed. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2667.76s)]
*  Because it reflects on them. I haven't told you that it's going to be easy. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2673.2000000000003s)]
*  I haven't told you that the enemy may not fire missiles, fire missiles at our [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2678.32s)]
*  military bases and so forth. I haven't told you any of that. I don't sell you a bill of goods. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2682.88s)]
*  I tell you what I think and I know what's there. Reality is there. I'll tell you what's interesting [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2687.2000000000003s)]
*  about that point, if I may add a footnote here. If that's our concern every time, even when the [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2691.12s)]
*  most righteous and noble action is taken under the most crucial and grave of circumstances to [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2700.24s)]
*  try and stop an international terrorist Islamist regime from getting a nuclear weapon and [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2707.12s)]
*  intercontinental ballistic missiles to shoot at us. And if the argument is [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2714.24s)]
*  that we must do nothing about it, otherwise they might shoot at our bases, then why do we have bases, [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2720.48s)]
*  Mr. Bidouche? What's the point of a military base? Why do we have this massive base in Qatar then? [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2725.52s)]
*  Why is it there? I'm being quite honest. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2734.56s)]
*  If the whole point is that they shouldn't be there because they might be shot at by the enemy, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2741.68s)]
*  then why are they there? [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2746.56s)]
*  I'm asking you. The answer is self-explanatory, it's self-evident. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2751.44s)]
*  Here's the Iranian foreign minister today. Today, cut six via translator, go. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2756.56s)]
*  We are not seeking negotiations. It is the Americans who want talks. They've sent messages [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2763.36s)]
*  several times, very serious ones. But we made it explicitly clear to them that as long as this [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2768.88s)]
*  aggression and invasion continues, there's absolutely no room for talk or diplomacy. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2774.8s)]
*  We are engaged in legitimate self-defense, and this defense will not stop under any circumstances. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2781.6800000000003s)]
*  We have nothing to discuss with the United States, which is a partner in these crimes. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2788.32s)]
*  Well, that seems to say it all. No wonder they can't put those three words together. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2794.96s)]
*  We surrender unconditionally. They're never going to say it. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2799.28s)]
*  Now, the isolationists will blame that on us. They'll blame it on the 80% of the American [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2805.6s)]
*  people who want these sites taken out. 84% of Republicans, 90% of MAGA. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2810.1600000000003s)]
*  They want them taken out. All of you should be investigated, according to Rosie O'Donnell Bannon. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2818.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, because you don't agree with him. Yeah. Moronic. And these guys are getting more moronic [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2824.4s)]
*  by the day, more bizarre by the day. I guess that's why I find it kind of entertaining to [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2832.2400000000002s)]
*  expose them to you and make you aware of them. Most of you never heard of these people, except [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2838.88s)]
*  when they come in and out of courthouses, I guess. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2844.08s)]
*  Simone Sanders. Didn't Simone Sanders work for Biden, Mr. Producer? I believe she did. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2849.52s)]
*  Biden and Bernie. So she's a whack job. She worked for two head cases. One is a Stalinist, [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2855.68s)]
*  and one is a he doesn't know what he is. And that's on her resume. So of course they hire her as a [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2863.6s)]
*  host, I think, at MSLSD. Now MSLSD is the network for reprobates. Oh yeah. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2868.8s)]
*  For reprobates. I believe her name is Sanders Townsend. Simone Sanders Townsend. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2877.76s)]
*  Hyphenated. Let's take a listen to this, folks. Cut seven, go. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2885.52s)]
*  So look at the flash poll from the Washington Post, and they conducted this yesterday. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2890.8s)]
*  This is the question was, would you support the U.S. launching military strikes against Iran [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2896.8s)]
*  over its nuclear program? 25% support. We're not launching military strikes against Iran. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2901.52s)]
*  We're launching, if we do, military strikes against their nuclear sites. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=2907.6000000000004s)]

*  the following. We do not have any indication that there is a systematic program in Iran [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3178.08s)]

*  So the director general of the IEA will speak in a minute in the security council. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3231.36s)]
*  I would advise you to ask him that the amount of uranium that was enriched already in Iran, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3235.92s)]
*  if it serves civilian usage or a military program. Let him answer that question. We have the [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3242.96s)]
*  information. We have the intelligence that Iran built a military program, not a civilian one, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3249.04s)]
*  which was not supervised by the IEA. I want to hear that. Here's my question. Why would it take, [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3255.52s)]
*  Mr. Producer, 40 years to build a civilian nuclear program? It doesn't take 40 years to build a [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3262.08s)]
*  civilian nuclear program. It doesn't take 40 years to do it. Where is there infrastructure [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3269.6s)]
*  to use all this new nuclear energy that they're going to create for their people? [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3278.7999999999997s)]
*  And why would they spend hundreds and hundreds of billions, and you don't need that much, [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3286.48s)]
*  why would they spend that for a domestic nuclear program when they have so much oil? [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3290.16s)]
*  They're selling it to the communist Chinese. Now, you really have to be a lunatic to buy in on this. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3294.96s)]
*  These are excuses. These are lies. This is cover. That's all it is. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3300.56s)]
*  That's all. And then you have this reporter pressing the ambassador. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3308.64s)]
*  Where's the evidence? It's all over the place. You can pull it up on pull it up on your computer. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3312.64s)]
*  Pull it up on your computer. So people are suggesting that the Israelis are doing this [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3317.6s)]
*  just to do it, or that the President of the United States is seriously considering assisting [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3324.64s)]
*  with one or more of these nuclear sites because he must be a warmonger. Crazy, crazy. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3330.16s)]
*  Crazy. But then I want you to listen to Chris Van Hollen. Chris Van Hollen is as close to an [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3338.64s)]
*  American Islamist as you can get. He's not quite where Tlaib and Omar and the rest of them are, [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3347.9199999999996s)]
*  but he's close. He and his wife, I'm told his wife has a really rabid nut job, with all due respect, [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3352.8799999999997s)]
*  of course. And so you see, we're going to be dragged into a war. This is also the [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3358.3999999999996s)]
*  position of Rosie O'Donnell Bannon. So when you hear Chris Hollen here speak, Van Hollen, [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3364.72s)]
*  excuse me, when you hear him, he's basically saying the same thing as Rosie O'Donnell Bannon. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3370.64s)]
*  Netanyahu. Hate Netanyahu. It's Netanyahu. Probably the greatest leader the Israelis have ever had. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3378.64s)]
*  So you got to attack him. Cut 11, go. Prime Minister Netanyahu has always wanted to drag [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3387.6s)]
*  the United States into a war with Iran. Remember that's right. That's right. That's why we have [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3394.88s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of troops in Israel, right? Right. That's why the biggest military base in [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3400.08s)]
*  the Middle East is in Qatar, right? Just want to make sure I understand this. Just want to make [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3406.16s)]
*  sure I understand it. That's why we have troops in Gaza, right? That's why we have troops in Lebanon, [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3411.36s)]
*  right? This guy's a bigot. This guy's a bigot. That's what he is. Except when it comes to [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3416.96s)]
*  illegal aliens who beat their wives, who have sold apparently hundreds and hundreds of [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3426.1600000000003s)]
*  illegal aliens into sex slavery, human trafficking, and of course as a member of MS-13. There [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3433.52s)]
*  he slobbers all over them. He buys them a drink. He sits down with them, [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3442.0s)]
*  defends them. But Netanyahu, you see, dragging us into a war. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3446.32s)]
*  Nobody's dragging Donald Trump into anything. Nobody. Go ahead. Who was a big cheerleader for [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3454.08s)]
*  the war in Iraq and many people believed that would be quote, he didn't drag us into a war in Iraq. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3463.76s)]
*  You must be confusing him with Bush. But regardless, you see what I mean, ladies and gentlemen? [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3470.4s)]
*  This guy is, in fact, I'll call him an Islamist. He's close enough. Now don't get me wrong. He, [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3480.4s)]
*  those of you who are obsessed with color, mostly on the left, he is transparent. I wouldn't call [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3487.6800000000003s)]
*  him Caucasian or white. No, he's transparent. But for him, it's always Netanyahu, what he's trying [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3493.76s)]
*  to say there, it's the Jews. The Jews are behind this. Netanyahu is dragging us into this. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3500.08s)]
*  Let's say Netanyahu is dragging us into this and we eliminate the nuclear site. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3507.6s)]

*  not in a safe situation. And so we activated our resources. We were able to get 1,500 people out of [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3709.52s)]
*  Israel. And we are now in the process of flying many of those back to the United States. We've [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3716.8s)]
*  had two plane loads, about 160, 170 in each plane load. And we have more that are going to be coming. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3722.32s)]
*  And I can tell you, so I met with the folks that arrived at Tampa Airport this morning at about 6 a.m. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3728.32s)]
*  And they were just very, very thankful that the state of Florida is there, that we're reacting, [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3734.56s)]
*  that we're utilizing our know-how to be able to do what's right for the people, not just of our [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3740.4s)]
*  state, but for our fellow countrymen. I mean, Mark, I had people coming who, you know, almost all these [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3745.04s)]
*  people visit Florida if they're not Florida residents, but with like young kids. You know, [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3750.56s)]
*  it's one thing to have missiles raining down if it's just you as an adult. And I think, you know, [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3754.72s)]
*  you kind of just deal with it. But when you start talking about a family that's got a two-year-old, [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3760.72s)]
*  a four-year-old, and a six-year-old, you know, immediately you are thinking about, I've got to [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3765.68s)]
*  get my kids to safety. So we were able to welcome some big families as well. And it was a very [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3770.72s)]
*  emotional thing. I mean, they've been through a lot. These are folks that, obviously, you know, [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3775.8399999999997s)]
*  the Middle East is, there's instability. But, you know, they didn't know a month ago when they arrived [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3780.3999999999996s)]
*  in Israel that they would be facing this possibility. So the mission continues. We're going to continue [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3785.2s)]
*  to work to bring people back safely. I don't know when the airport's going to open back up. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3790.32s)]
*  And, I mean, you know the region well, Mark. It isn't like there's a lot of great options nearby. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3795.76s)]
*  I mean, we had to put a load of people up on a cruise ship and send them over to Cyprus. And then [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3801.2000000000003s)]
*  the planes were leaving out of Cyprus, some to Florida, and then some folks had flights to other [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3805.6800000000003s)]
*  places. But we're glad to be able to help. And we're going to continue to help until the job's [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3811.2000000000003s)]
*  finished. Yeah, and I think among the people you got as our buddy, Josh Hammer, and his young [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3815.04s)]
*  family, let me ask you a question, Governor. You brought up something that I don't think gets [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3820.48s)]
*  discussed enough. That is, imagine we have 700,000 American citizens in Israel, 700,000. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3824.96s)]
*  And all those people there, whether they're Arab, or Jewish, or Muslim, or Jewish, or Christian, [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3833.2799999999997s)]
*  or Druze, they have a big mix of people there. People don't realize it. These daily and nightly [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3840.16s)]
*  missile attacks, the sirens day in and day out since October 7th and now when you have little kids [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3847.68s)]
*  and they're constantly being pulled out of their beds, they're constantly running for protection, [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3854.3199999999997s)]
*  they're constantly hearing whether the missiles are intercepted or they've [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3858.3199999999997s)]
*  they've landed a block away. This has a horrific effect on a society, doesn't it? [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3862.16s)]
*  Oh, yeah, no question. And just as a parent, I mean, we, my wife and I, we've got a daughter [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3866.4s)]
*  going into third grade, a son going into second, and our youngest daughter going into kindergarten. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3872.4s)]
*  And it's hard enough keeping after them in normal situations. You start putting a family like that [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3877.04s)]
*  in those types of situations. It's really, really traumatic for the kids. And it's, you know, [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3883.92s)]
*  Josh Hammer said to me, he's like, listen, we're there and there's just sirens and you got to figure [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3890.32s)]
*  out I have a six month old baby and we don't want to have to be dodging missiles every other hour [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3893.92s)]
*  with with a six month old. We want to make sure the six month old is safe and sound. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3901.6000000000004s)]
*  So it is it is definitely a challenge. Now I will say that the Israeli people, they deal with this. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3905.44s)]
*  I mean, they've been dealing with it pretty much the whole time for the history of modern Israel [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3912.32s)]
*  in the sense that they're always have threats. You've had different types of conflicts. Obviously, [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3917.36s)]
*  the 48 conflicts, 67, 73 intifada. So they just know and a lot of people in Israel in my travels, [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3923.28s)]
*  they're they're they're very, you know, they just understand. They understand that that they're up [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3931.0400000000004s)]
*  against a lot of opposition and they have to fight if they want to keep their homeland. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3936.4s)]
*  But at the same time, so dodging into a bomb shelter, if you're down in like Stay Road, [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3941.6800000000003s)]
*  which is by the Gaza Strip, they just this is way before October 7th. I mean, they would just know [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3946.8s)]
*  that they would have to do this. It wasn't like October 7th was the first time. So this has kind [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3951.92s)]
*  of been part of Israeli society. But I think now you have just a really heavy bombardment from [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3955.92s)]
*  Iranians, the ballistic missiles, you know, Israel does have air defense. The US is helping with some [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3961.04s)]
*  of the air defense. But it is not even the best air defense is not foolproof when you're talking [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3966.96s)]
*  about these these big powerful ballistic missiles. And it's, you know, they've been dealing with [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3971.36s)]
*  October 7th fallout. And now they're dealing with this. It wears on people. There's just no question [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3977.52s)]
*  about it. And it wears on the military. I mean, their military relies on reservists, citizens, [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3982.48s)]
*  for the most part. And they leave their careers, they leave their jobs, they leave their families, [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3991.36s)]
*  and they're in these long deployments, long deployments, and then they're deployed again. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=3997.2s)]
*  And so over time, also, you wear down the armaments, the number of armaments, and so we're [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4002.2400000000002s)]
*  finding that out in terms of these these interceptor missiles, even on our ships. And the problem is [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4008.8s)]
*  they're running out of them. We're running out of them. The best of the missiles in Israel that [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4013.92s)]
*  hit the ballistic missiles to the extent they can, they're two million dollars a piece. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4020.08s)]
*  And you just can't keep this up day in and day out, day in and day out. So you have to have an [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4025.36s)]
*  offensive strategy, right? No, exactly. I think Israel was faced with just the situation where [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4029.44s)]
*  Iran represents an existential threat to Israel if the Iranian regime was able to obtain a nuclear [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4036.7200000000003s)]
*  weapon. And the reason is the mullahs in Iran, they are militant Shia Islamists, and they have [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4043.44s)]
*  an apocalyptic view of the world. And we relied with them, we fought the Soviet Union in the Cold [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4051.12s)]
*  War, for example, on mutually assured destruction. Soviets would not have wanted to attack us with [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4058.88s)]
*  nuclear weapons because we would have responded. And it would have been it would have been lights [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4063.6800000000003s)]
*  out for both societies. Soviets were atheists. And so that didn't appeal to them just be wiped [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4068.0s)]
*  off. The Iranian mullahs, you know, they view this idea of mutually assured destruction, [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4072.6400000000003s)]
*  not as a deterrent, but really as an inducement. If they could wipe Israel off the map, even if [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4078.6400000000003s)]
*  Israel was able to get off retaliatory strikes and a lot of millions of Iranians went up in smoke, [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4083.92s)]
*  the mullahs would view that as a good thing. They think that that's what they have to do [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4090.88s)]
*  to further this apocalyptic militant Islam. And so I think the Prime Minister of Israel [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4096.24s)]
*  has recognized this for a long time. Most people in Israel recognize this. They just cannot get in [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4102.96s)]
*  the situation where Iran is allowed to obtain a nuclear weapon. And, you know, to his credit, [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4108.56s)]
*  President Trump has never wavered from that either. I mean, when he ran in 2015, he said Iran cannot [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4114.400000000001s)]
*  have a nuclear weapon. And to this day, he says Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. I think the reason [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4120.0s)]
*  is for what I articulated. I mean, we don't want to see nuclear proliferation period, because these [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4125.360000000001s)]
*  are very dangerous weapons. But those weapons in the hands of a militant Shia Islamist regime [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4131.2s)]
*  with Khamenei at the head, that is an existential threat to Israel's survival. And honestly, [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4140.4s)]
*  would be a significant threat to the United States, because there's not been a country in [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4147.44s)]
*  the world since 1979 that has been more consistently hostile to the United States of America than the [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4152.24s)]
*  Islamic State in Iran and the Mullahs in both ayatollahs. And that goes back to the Beirut [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4159.12s)]
*  bombing, obviously the hostage crisis in 79. Before that, it goes to the Qobar towers, it goes to the [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4165.68s)]
*  attacks against US troops. When I was serving in Iraq, almost all the casualties on the time I was [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4172.96s)]
*  there were Iranian backed attacks using the Shia militias. And on and on it goes, and they have [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4178.4s)]
*  never wavered from their belief that America is the great Satan. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4184.64s)]
*  Let's get a little parochial here. In Florida, you have been trying, trying strongly [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4190.8s)]
*  to address these property taxes in Florida. Where is that? And what is it that you're trying to do [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4198.72s)]
*  again? So ultimately, what we need to do, so my view is simple. You either own your house [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4204.0s)]
*  in your property or you don't. And if you constantly have to write checks to the government [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4212.8s)]
*  to pay property taxes, then you don't really truly own it. Because if you stop paying that rent to [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4218.64s)]
*  the government, they could come in and take your property. And so we have something and you've [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4223.76s)]
*  probably availed yourself of this mark, where a Florida resident can establish a homestead. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4228.24s)]
*  So that's your primary residence. And it's my view that your homesteaded property, your primary [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4233.12s)]
*  residence should not be subject to property tax. And so but in order to do that, you can't just [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4238.4s)]
*  pass a piece of legislation the way Florida's constitution is outlined. Those property taxes [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4245.599999999999s)]
*  are given to local government to administer or not. And it is effectively a local issue. And so [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4252.16s)]
*  what we're going to do is we are going to get work with the legislature to get a ballot initiative [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4258.719999999999s)]
*  on November of 2026 ballot that will give Floridians the opportunity to exempt their [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4265.6s)]
*  personal residences from property tax. Now, we're running the numbers, there's a lot of different [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4272.72s)]
*  permutations. The reality is this can be done. A lot of the local governments have gotten bloated. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4278.64s)]
*  They do need to cut back to pre-COVID levels anyways. But there are way other ways that if [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4284.96s)]
*  they did need to raise revenue with all the tourists and all the visitors coming down, [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4291.28s)]
*  I want those folks to shoulder the tax burden mark. I don't want Florida homeowners to constantly [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4295.599999999999s)]
*  having to pay more in property tax. And you know, some of it's being a victim of our own success, [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4301.92s)]
*  because Florida has been the most desired place to move to over the last five years. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4306.88s)]
*  People's properties have gone up. And in some respects, that's a great thing, because [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4311.759999999999s)]
*  a lot of middle class people, their home is the number one source of wealth that they possess. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4316.400000000001s)]
*  But the flip side of that is you may have bought a house for $300,000 10 years ago. Now some property [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4321.6s)]
*  appraiser is telling you it's worth a million and you got to pay more taxes on that. That is not [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4328.320000000001s)]
*  right. And so we're going to do something about it. Beautiful. Now you were having problems with [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4333.76s)]
*  this individual who was the speaker who seemed to be intentionally sort of sabotaging your agenda. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4339.04s)]
*  In order to to draw attention to himself because he wants to be mayor of Miami or whatever the [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4346.320000000001s)]
*  hell it is. You still having that problem with this guy Perez? Yeah, look, I mean, we were able [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4351.84s)]
*  to do all the things that I set out to do we accomplished in this legislative session, [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4358.8s)]
*  we were able to do the the really the one of the one of a kind in the nation immigration enforcement, [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4364.8s)]
*  where I talked to you about that months ago. All 67 counties in Florida have 287 g agreements with [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4370.56s)]
*  the federal government, our municipalities and police departments. And so we are leading in [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4378.400000000001s)]
*  deportation and immigration enforcement support for the federal government way above and we're [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4384.72s)]
*  even talking about utilizing this this airport in the Florida Everglades to be our alligator [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4390.400000000001s)]
*  Alcatraz where we can have particularly the criminal aliens detained there until ICE can [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4397.76s)]
*  process them and return them to their home countries. And so he fought me on that. He [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4404.88s)]
*  tried to sabotage that he even tried to do a legislation that would strip the governor of [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4410.320000000001s)]
*  any power to help with immigration enforcement and even shut down the operations I was already doing, [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4417.2s)]
*  particularly to protect Florida's coastlines. And so we you know, we had an outcry we were able to [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4423.52s)]
*  win. He tried to reverse our tort reform, he failed. He tried to kneecap our higher education [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4428.4s)]
*  reforms, or we're really working to fight woke and not have our universities be indoctrination centers. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4435.52s)]
*  He wanted it to go back to status quo. So he lost on all these things. And then he produced that they [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4441.6s)]
*  were they were 45 days late with the budget. So they just passed the budget this week, it was [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4447.2s)]
*  supposed to be passed on May 2. And that was solely because the speaker was basically trying [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4452.24s)]
*  to sabotage the process so that you end up with a budget that they could have done two months ago. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4458.88s)]
*  There's nothing special about it. And it was just him doing this. So you know, I just think he made [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4464.48s)]
*  bad decision after bad decision. I don't think that his motivation is to serve the people the [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4469.84s)]
*  way you know, I envision it and most of the other legislators, I think it's more of a personal agenda. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4475.2s)]
*  And I think he's got vendetta. He tried to do that and it failed. And everybody knows it failed. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4480.4s)]
*  And so we'll see what happens going forward. But I think it was a textbook example of what not to do. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4485.92s)]
*  If you're in the position of being a presiding officer in one of the legislative chambers. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4492.719999999999s)]
*  I've got to go. What's his name again? This full name Perez, right? Something [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4497.679999999999s)]
*  Daniel for Daniel Perez. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4502.32s)]
*  Okay. And what's he want to run for? What did I read Miami Mayor something? [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4504.48s)]
*  I don't know if that's true or not, Mark. I mean, I don't know what his motivations are. But the [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4508.72s)]
*  reality is, is Florida set the standard, everybody looks to us for leadership. The correct posture [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4514.16s)]
*  is to continue what we've got to build off the success by being even bolder and stronger. And [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4521.4400000000005s)]
*  he chose to do the opposite, basically trying to sabotage what we've accomplished. And he did not [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4527.92s)]
*  have a mandate to do that. And I think he put his members in a position where they were taking a [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4534.16s)]
*  lot of really bad votes. All right. America's governor, my governor, thank God in Florida, [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4538.639999999999s)]

*  Like I've told you before, historic, iconic. You're never going to see the likes of him again. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4645.68s)]
*  And I'm so proud of my governor, Ron DeSantis. Is there a better governor in the country? No, [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4652.96s)]
*  there's not. He is just unbelievable. Which brings to mind, Mr. Producer, given the fact that Rosie [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4657.12s)]
*  O'Donnell Bannon says that I and others should be investigated and perhaps thrown in prison, [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4664.4s)]
*  I assume, as a result of the investigation for supporting Israel. Would that be one of [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4668.48s)]
*  the charges against me? You think? You kind of wonder, don't you? I heard he had lunch at the [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4673.28s)]
*  White House. Man, oh man, a Shevitz that must have owned one big damn, damn lunch for that boy. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4680.879999999999s)]
*  I'll be right back. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4688.08s)]
*  He's here. Now, broadcasting from the Underground Command Post. Deep in the bowels of a hidden [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4695.04s)]
*  bunker, somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building, [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4702.5599999999995s)]

*  You know, I didn't mention Saturday, tomorrow evening, 8 p.m. Eastern, 8 p.m. Eastern, [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4723.68s)]
*  8 p.m. Eastern on Fox. You can DVR it. We will have John Yoo and retired British Colonel Richard [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4730.96s)]
*  Kemp. This guy is right out of the movies. He was the commander of the British forces in Afghanistan [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4740.320000000001s)]
*  and he will be coming to us from Israel. John Yoo and I will be discussing the War Powers Act. Now, [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4745.68s)]
*  you might think that's boring. It's not boring at all because we have some constitutional [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4750.8s)]
*  illiterates claiming that it's constitutional and demanding that it be used, like Tommy Massey and [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4755.6s)]
*  some of the others. So, that'll be a fascinating discussion. And of course, Colonel Richard Kemp, [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4762.0s)]
*  who really is a tough, tough guy, but very smart. On Sunday, 8 p.m. Eastern, we're going to have [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4769.2s)]
*  Zoudi Jasser and discuss further the mind of the Islamist terrorist, [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4778.88s)]
*  so the whole country knows what we're dealing with. And special, really another special guest, [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4783.92s)]
*  minister to the government there, Ron Dermer, who's probably the closest aide to the Prime Minister. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4793.28s)]
*  So, we'll have them. And of course, we'll have my opening statement. I want you to know I'm preparing [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4800.320000000001s)]
*  his opening statements now and there's a little bit of a surprise in them and I think you're going [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4804.08s)]
*  to love them. I'm officially calling for the government to investigate Steve Bannon in China. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4809.84s)]
*  I'll leave it at that. Steve Bannon in China. I'm serious, very serious. Yes, I am serious. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4821.12s)]
*  Steve Bannon. Maybe he can address them on his widely watched and listened to podcast. What's [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4828.8s)]
*  it called? Rosie O'Donnell Bannon? Something like that. And that's your new name, Steve. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4837.28s)]
*  That's your new name. Now, they call me lots of stuff, but it doesn't stick. Their platforms [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4844.64s)]
*  aren't big enough. The great ones are good enough. And by the way, that Hannity gave me that. I would [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4850.08s)]
*  never give that to myself. When I was growing up, it was Jackie Gleason who was the great one. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4855.2s)]
*  What's that hockey guy? I'm kidding. Gretzky was the great one. But I guess I'm the great one in [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4860.88s)]
*  this industry, according to some. You don't hear me going around. Denali, I like that better. But [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4869.599999999999s)]
*  then the president kind of blew that. He eliminated the Mount McKinley. He went back to Mount McKinley, [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4875.04s)]
*  loves McKinley, who was like the king of tariffs. You know, but I'm saying Trump named it back to [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4880.24s)]
*  McKinley was Obama that named it Denali and people would call in here and call me Denali. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4887.679999999999s)]
*  Hey, it's fun. Why can I tell you this? You know what I'm going to do something I wasn't [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4892.8s)]
*  planning on doing Mr. Producer. You enjoy it when I talk about the Constitution and other things [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4899.12s)]
*  like that. You want to have some fun here? Let's have some fun here. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4906.0s)]
*  Want to learn a little bit about Alexander Hamilton? [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4910.96s)]
*  You want to have a little bit of fun here? Let's do this. What do you say folks? Let's try this out. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4916.0s)]
*  Of course, it's in my new book On Power, and I'm sure you've grabbed your pre-order copy given the [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4919.6s)]
*  great price, right? Go to Amazon.com and grab it before everybody else. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4925.44s)]
*  And the more these pre-orders that sell, the better the discount for everybody. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4930.08s)]
*  I'll start here on page 165. Let's see. I'm examining liberty [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4936.4s)]
*  as it was perceived by the. I can't even read this. Okay, let me bring this here. Sorry. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4945.76s)]
*  A little problem with one of my eyes. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4953.44s)]
*  Alexander Hamilton, his notion about liberty and the role of government often conflicted [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4957.44s)]
*  with Jefferson's and Madison's. See, we don't need PBS. We have me, Mr. Producer. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4963.2s)]
*  We don't need NPR. We have me right here. Indeed, it turns out that Hamilton is among the most [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4969.04s)]
*  popular, if not the most popular, founder among those who today support a more centralized and [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4976.24s)]
*  activist government. There's good reason for this, America. Hence the popularity of Hamilton, [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4982.24s)]
*  the Broadway musical, especially with the elites in entertainment, media and politics, [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4988.8s)]
*  and among most academicians. In examining Hamilton, I begin with Madison, who wrote [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=4994.400000000001s)]
*  in Federalist number 45. This is all important. This is your history. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5001.360000000001s)]
*  The power is delegated by the, you notice the nature of this book, how it moves from one subject [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5006.64s)]
*  to the other, and it does so in a way that it flows and streams. In other words, one piece [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5011.92s)]
*  connected to the other because it's about power. And the other night I was telling you about the [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5016.24s)]
*  Islamists, and a couple of weeks ago I was explaining Judaism and Christianity in the [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5020.719999999999s)]
*  context of the founding of the nation. This book is very, I think you'll find it very fascinating. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5026.48s)]
*  So let's take a look at Federalist number 45. The powers delegated by the proposed constitution, [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5032.32s)]
*  the federal government, are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the state governments [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5038.64s)]
*  are numerous and indefinite. The former will be exercised principally on external objects [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5049.52s)]
*  as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign commerce, with which the last of the powers [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5060.4800000000005s)]
*  of taxation will be for the most part by, ladies and gentlemen, I'm having difficulty with my [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5069.4400000000005s)]
*  left eye. Can you believe that, Rich? Can you believe that, America? I'm sorry. I'll pick up [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5078.08s)]
*  where I left off on Monday. I apologize to you. I really do. I thought I could muscle through. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5085.52s)]
*  I can't. I can't. It's too blurry. I can't see it. I will pick that up. But let me just give you [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5089.4400000000005s)]
*  a feel for this without necessarily having to read from the Federalist papers. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5096.4s)]
*  Hamilton believed more and more in a centralized government. As a matter of fact, [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5102.5599999999995s)]
*  at the Constitutional Convention, he was proposing life terms for senators. That was rejected. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5105.599999999999s)]
*  Then he proposed for senators terms based on good behavior, which could be for life. That was [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5111.44s)]
*  rejected overwhelmingly. And yet he was, with Madison and John Jay, but particularly he and [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5117.2s)]
*  Madison were the main authors of the Federalist papers, pushing hard the Constitution. And the [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5123.36s)]
*  Constitution, of course, is a document of limited powers, separation powers, and so forth and so on. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5128.16s)]
*  Then what happens? The Constitution's ratified. Hamilton argues for it, as does Madison and others. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5137.04s)]
*  And then a big issue that comes up during George Washington's presidency is this idea of a national [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5144.96s)]
*  bank. This is in the book. I'm just describing it now. Well, the problem was, the problem was for [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5149.84s)]
*  many of the framers of the Constitution, they said the federal government doesn't have any role in this. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5157.12s)]
*  The states can create all the banks they want or not. But there is no such thing as a national bank. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5163.84s)]
*  And so they were lobbying and trying to persuade President Washington one way or another, just as [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5171.68s)]
*  some people are trying to persuade President Trump to defend our country and not sell out to the [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5177.36s)]
*  Iranians. That's right. Doesn't take much persuasion, by the way. And so what happened? Well, they made [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5182.08s)]
*  their arguments, and they made their arguments not just personally to Washington, but in writing. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5191.599999999999s)]
*  So Hamilton goes on and he says, look, there are implied powers in the Constitution, implied powers. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5198.08s)]
*  And you have the power, President Washington, because of the finances of the nation, because [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5207.44s)]
*  of commerce, because of the so-called necessary and proper clause, you have implied powers [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5212.639999999999s)]
*  to create this bank. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5220.96s)]
*  Madison and Jefferson were flipping out. They said, no, you don't. There's no such thing as [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5226.0s)]
*  implied powers. They're express powers, but you don't have these powers. They belong to the people [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5231.52s)]
*  in the states. You can't just assume general power to create a bank, a national bank. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5238.160000000001s)]
*  The states will create all the banks they want. We can use their banks. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5243.52s)]
*  And Washington sided with Hamilton. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5250.64s)]
*  Washington sided with Hamilton. So Hamilton argues about implied powers. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5255.360000000001s)]
*  Jefferson and Madison said, there's no such thing. Otherwise, you'll destroy the Constitution. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5261.52s)]
*  Hamilton points to what's called the necessary and proper clause, because that clause basically [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5267.52s)]
*  says that Congress can pass what laws are necessary and proper for the implementation [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5272.320000000001s)]
*  of, say, for example, statutes that they pass. And what Jefferson and Madison said, [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5278.88s)]
*  and what I say, and what others who are serious about the text and the meaning of the Constitution [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5283.68s)]
*  say, necessary and proper doesn't mean you get to create new laws or you get to expand the power [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5288.56s)]
*  of the legislature and the courts and the presidents. It means, and we quote directly from Madison's [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5295.4400000000005s)]
*  notes, necessary and proper to pass laws to enforce existing laws, not to create separate subject matter laws. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5305.12s)]
*  So in other words, a couple of things going on here. Number one, how do you interpret the [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5320.4s)]
*  Constitution? So this battle came right out of the box, right out of the box, with Hamilton saying, [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5324.5599999999995s)]
*  very liberally, implied powers. Number two, since this necessary and proper clause, [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5330.72s)]
*  it's not just limited to the means by which you implement existing statutes. No, no, no, no. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5336.400000000001s)]
*  It gives Congress the power to pass other statutes, whatever is necessary and proper to fill in the blank. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5342.320000000001s)]
*  Of course, Jefferson and Madison said, no, this isn't a national legislature that can stop all [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5350.16s)]
*  over the states and their authority. But that's what Congress became. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5355.76s)]
*  And then the third shoe drops, if you will, and that's Marbury versus Madison in 1803. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5364.0s)]
*  Remember, Hamilton was a Federalist. Justice Marshall was a Federalist. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5371.92s)]
*  Jefferson and Madison were Republicans, or some call them Democratic Republicans. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5380.400000000001s)]
*  So they were truly more into Federalism. The Federalists were more into Centralism. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5386.56s)]
*  And so Marshall basically says, hey, look, I get to decide what the law is, [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5394.64s)]
*  whether it's constitutional or not. That is the court. And so Jefferson and Madison, [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5403.12s)]
*  they're sitting there and say, wait a minute, Madison, the father of the Constitution, [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5407.52s)]
*  Jefferson basically the father of the Declaration. That's not this. Now we have, [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5410.88s)]
*  we have a president and a congress that's saying they have implied powers and under the necessary [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5417.12s)]
*  and proper clause, they can basically legislate on anything they want. That's not what we said [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5421.2s)]
*  in the Federalist papers. That's not what we said in the Constitutional Convention. That's not what [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5425.92s)]
*  we said in the state conventions. And now the damn court has said, and guess what? We get to have [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5430.56s)]
*  the final say on what is or is not constitutional. Jefferson said, this is unbelievable. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5437.36s)]
*  Madison too. This is unbelievable. So we're talking about the really the very beginning [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5448.96s)]
*  of our governmental system. The Federalists today would be like the Democrat Party today. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5456.48s)]
*  And they stole the name Federalist because Federalism, as you understand, that's more [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5463.2s)]
*  state authority, state rights, but they were thought they were very clever. So they took for [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5467.76s)]
*  themselves the word Federalism, even though they're really the Anti-Federalists and the [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5472.639999999999s)]
*  Anti-Federalists were really the pro-Federalists. So some of the things that were raised [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5478.5599999999995s)]
*  in the Anti-Federalist papers of which there were Anti-Federalist papers by Brutus and others, [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5486.72s)]
*  unfortunately turned out to be accurate. Not because of the way the Constitution's written, [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5494.16s)]
*  but because the way power was asserted, which goes back to the point of the book, power. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5498.639999999999s)]
*  This battle over power is eternal [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5507.28s)]
*  within countries, among countries, [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5512.639999999999s)]
*  within families in some cases, within businesses, within labor unions, [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5516.72s)]
*  within HOAs, within towns and cities and states, your daily interactions. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5521.12s)]
*  It's got many, many tributaries and I can't follow all of them because [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5529.04s)]
*  that would be a writing assignment that I would do till I die. So I'm focusing on what will we do here, [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5533.919999999999s)]
*  which is society, culture, government, politics. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5543.12s)]
*  And so I walk you through the history of our founding. I walk you through how power, the fight [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5545.76s)]
*  over power, how where we are today had its roots in the battles of power and where we will be [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5549.84s)]
*  tomorrow have these roots of the battle in power. And it's not just to say battle, [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5556.24s)]
*  it's the battles over power. It's to explain how these things incrementally push in one [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5559.84s)]
*  direction or another. It's to explain what negative power is, what positive power is. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5564.88s)]
*  The nomenclature that I'm creating in order to discuss this. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5570.72s)]
*  I get into thought control and language control, the creation of new words, the redefinition of [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5576.08s)]
*  other words, the banning of words, the shaming of the use of certain words, and so forth and so on. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5580.96s)]
*  Also the great new dangers that are actually more tangible or contextual. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5587.76s)]
*  Less theoretical, wokeism. Wokeism is sort of the new, [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5595.2s)]
*  we talk about economic Marxism and economic oppressors and oppressed and the haves and [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5603.36s)]
*  the haves not, the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. Wokeism is sort of the new [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5608.32s)]
*  Marxism, but without the economic tinge on it. Where'd you get that? [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5613.84s)]
*  New Marxism, but without the economic tinge on it. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5619.2s)]
*  Words you can use, jobs you can have, things you can say, on and on and on. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5624.5599999999995s)]
*  So I'm just giving a tiny taste of this. We're going to go into this very thoroughly when the [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5630.4s)]
*  book comes out. I'm not allowed to do much more. That comes out on July 29th. It'll be launched on [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5634.16s)]
*  the Hannity program. My first Sunday, we'll spend an hour on it. I'll be on other programs. I'm [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5640.08s)]
*  doing three signings. We're going to announce one of them in about a week or so, and we're going [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5646.4s)]
*  to jump right into this. And I think you're going to love it. No matter what your background is, [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5652.08s)]
*  no matter what your education is, no matter any of that, it's written for all of you. I'll be right [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5656.5599999999995s)]
*  back. Month, Lovin'. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5662.639999999999s)]
*  So I was telling Mr. Paulson, Mr. Producer, actually during the break, [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5676.96s)]
*  you see this commercial with this OBGYN, with her, I think it's called Luma. Rub it on all your [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5682.719999999999s)]
*  spots. And I won't say what she says. All your, you know what. I'm saying, Mr. Bill, we could make a [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5690.08s)]
*  fortune doing that. Oh yeah. Yeah. Just come up with something that smells good and you know, [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5695.28s)]
*  put it everywhere, put it here, put it there, put it everywhere. And I see some knockoffs now. So [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5701.92s)]
*  all over the place, you know, kids get to watch this stuff about you can rub this here and rub [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5706.0s)]
*  this there. It's like this erectile dysfunction stuff. What is this? And you know, I've banned [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5711.04s)]
*  that on this program. I said, we're not doing that. Then they have a carrot. You see this stuff, [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5717.12s)]
*  Mr. It's sick. And then I watch all these commercials with those. They're always dancing. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5722.88s)]
*  They're marching. They're dancing. And what's this? Crazy. I shall return. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5729.04s)]
*  The Mark Levin Show, the pool feed for the conservative media. Dive in now. 877-381-3811. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5742.08s)]
*  First of all, I want to apologize again when I started to read and I couldn't complete that, [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5752.8s)]
*  but I told you what I was aiming at in the book. It's really important to me to convey properly [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5757.76s)]
*  what's in this book. It really is. I want you to enjoy it. I want you to acquire it. I want you [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5763.92s)]
*  to share it. And I want you to learn from it. So it's very important to me that I properly convey [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5769.360000000001s)]
*  to you what's in this book. And that is my goal. And I hope that you preorder your copies. You can [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5775.4400000000005s)]
*  do it tonight. Do it over the weekend and to get the best discounts possible that way too. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5784.4s)]
*  Okay. Let's take a few callers here. Shall we? Yes, we can. Let's see here. There it is. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5791.28s)]
*  Clifton, New Jersey. How are you, sir? Tony, go right ahead, please. I mean, ma'am, I apologize. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5799.599999999999s)]
*  Hi, Mark. Congratulations on your book. Thank you, Tony. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5807.12s)]
*  I'm sure that it's going to really rock the casbah, as they say. I like that song. Thank you. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5811.2s)]
*  You know, my mind tonight is on the Shiva and what went on at the hospital when [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5820.72s)]
*  Iran hit the hospital there. And it reminds me of what I've been trying to get to talk to you about [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5827.44s)]
*  that when we think of Israel, and many people are thinking what to do about Israel, what happened [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5834.5599999999995s)]
*  next. For those of us with the Judeo-Christian background, you know, you look at the Shiva and [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5840.64s)]
*  that is the place where Abraham and Isaac, our founding fathers, dug the well. And that was a [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5846.72s)]
*  big city during the War of Independence when they had Operation Moses. So many things about [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5853.04s)]
*  the Shiva and there's still the well, there's archaeological sites there. That's my point tonight, [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5859.200000000001s)]
*  that tonight God is using President Trump in a mighty way and God is saying, [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5865.76s)]
*  don't mess. To me, that was a big city that they messed with, although there's so many cities like [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5872.56s)]
*  that. I encourage your readers as they look at what's happening in Israel to study your Old [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5878.320000000001s)]
*  Testament and your Torah and look at what's going on there now and your heart will break. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5885.04s)]
*  Many times you have to see the new name of cities, you know, especially where all the [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5890.16s)]
*  nucleocytes are. I'm doing a study on that. But it's a real place. It's part of our spiritual [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5894.8s)]
*  heritage and it's a battle of good and evil, Mark. It's the battle of the nuclear and it's [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5900.320000000001s)]
*  the battle of good and evil. And that's all I wanted to say tonight. And beautifully said, [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5906.24s)]
*  beautifully said, Tony. Thank you very, very much. God bless you. Let's continue. Joe, [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5911.52s)]
*  Houston, Texas, XM satellite. Joe, go right ahead, please. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5918.16s)]
*  Yes, sir. So then I just want to let you know, this is not classified information, [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5922.240000000001s)]
*  but the atomic bomb that Iran is developing is also the trigger for the thermonuclear hydrogen [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5927.92s)]
*  bomb. So they obtained the atomic bomb, then now they have the capability to build a thermonuclear [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5934.72s)]
*  hydrogen bomb as well. Which is massive, massive, massive destruction, correct? [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5945.4400000000005s)]
*  Yes, sir. That's the same weapon we have. People need to understand that these people [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5951.68s)]
*  want to destroy us. They want to kill us. They believe that. And I'm by us. I mean everybody. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5957.76s)]
*  And that's why they're trying to get these weapons. This isn't this isn't about Israel per se. These [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5963.84s)]
*  these hydrogen bombs, which is what Joe's talking about, these massive hydrogen bombs, [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5970.240000000001s)]
*  I mean, they can blow an entire region off the face of the earth. And they will do that. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5975.4400000000005s)]
*  And they have the capacity to build 10 of them. I don't even know why there's a debate in this [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5982.240000000001s)]
*  country, Joe, that this has to be taken out, whether by the Israelis or us or both of us together. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5986.4800000000005s)]
*  Why is this even being debated? I don't know, sir. But on top of that, [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5991.04s)]
*  like you know, they also have the delivery method on top of the weapon. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5996.240000000001s)]
*  Yes, they do. They're almost there with their intercontinental ballistic missiles. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=5999.76s)]
*  Intercontinental. That means they'll be able to blackmail us to move to the cows come home. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6004.72s)]
*  God, I just this is why I'm fighting. Thank you, Joe. This is why I'm fighting America. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6010.24s)]
*  This is why I'm fighting the Qataris. This is why I'm fighting the Rosie O'Donnell bannons. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6015.28s)]
*  This is why I'm fighting these people tooth and nail. And I will not relent. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6021.12s)]
*  This is why I'm fighting the Democrats. This is why I'm fighting the media. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6026.24s)]
*  This is why I'm supporting the president. I'm trying to counter some of the in beds [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6032.0s)]
*  of the Soros coke heads. This is important. This is the battle of our time. This is what our [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6037.28s)]
*  our generation needs to do. So he said, Well, can't we get on to other things? Well, [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6044.879999999999s)]
*  we do get on to other things. But this is front and center. If we lose this fight, [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6048.799999999999s)]
*  we lose the country. That's how serious this is. The Israelis have that country on their back. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6053.12s)]
*  They deserve our support. And quite frankly, our celebration for what they've done. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6059.2s)]
*  And they wouldn't be able to do it under Biden. They can do it under Trump. And our president [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6063.44s)]
*  deserves our praise. And frankly, our love and support. And I believe he's, he's very close to [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6069.44s)]
*  to doing what needs to be done, because there's no other options. Either these nuclear sites are [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6078.719999999999s)]
*  taken out, or they're going to survive. Because the Islamic Nazi regime is not going to give them [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6083.599999999999s)]
*  up no matter what. They believe God's on their side. That's the problem. Zoudi Jasra has explained [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6088.88s)]
*  this. General Keen has explained this. I've explained it. Others have explained it. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6095.12s)]
*  And so it's very important that you unite behind the commander in chief, the president is very [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6101.52s)]
*  important that when he comes under attack by fake maga, that real maga stand up and defend him, [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6106.400000000001s)]
*  it's very important that we understand we're part of 80 to 90% of the population of all parties and [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6112.08s)]
*  backgrounds. And these people that we hear these reprobates, they barely represent anybody. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6117.76s)]
*  But you got to assume at least 510% of the countries filled with kooks, right? Well, [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6127.68s)]
*  that's what they represent. Most of them. Most of them. Let's take another call. Jim New York City. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6131.280000000001s)]
*  Jim, how are you, sir? Mark Denali. Great to speak to you, sir. Thank you. How are you? [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6138.64s)]
*  I'm good. How are you? I'm good. Well, I just wanted to call in and express my great thanks to [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6146.16s)]
*  you and to our great president for his support of Israel in this time. Just a little bit about [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6154.639999999999s)]
*  me. I served as an Israeli soldier, combat soldier, combat paratrooper years ago. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6163.68s)]
*  I'm an American patriot. And I must say that I am absolutely proud of our president at this time. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6171.360000000001s)]
*  And thank you for defending him against the many attacks, especially those attacks from the [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6178.56s)]
*  isolationists who have no appreciation and show no recognition of the reality that we face here, [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6183.04s)]
*  the danger that we face here with nuclear Iran. And I thought BB put it perfectly where he said [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6191.360000000001s)]
*  we were at the 12th hour and we had to make a move. And the president showed his support. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6197.84s)]
*  The president's plane ride home, I thought from the G7 summit where he was asked, you know, [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6204.0s)]
*  are you willing to negotiate? He said, no, I'm not in the mood. I thought that was the exact correct [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6208.32s)]
*  answer. And, you know, he gave Iran time to come to the table and come to a negotiation here. And [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6213.84s)]
*  they obviously acted in bad faith during those 60 days. They could tell that they were just stringing [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6221.76s)]
*  them along, trying to, you know, not really negotiating good faith. And the president did [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6227.36s)]
*  the right thing on day 61. He let Israel do its thing. And he said, now I want unconditional [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6233.679999999999s)]
*  surrender. And that's exactly the position that this evil Islamo-Nazi regime needs to be in. They [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6240.4s)]
*  need to understand that they face that they that they have the opportunity to say, you know, [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6246.799999999999s)]
*  we surrender or otherwise our nuclear program's gone and potentially our regime. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6252.64s)]
*  Well, first of all, thank you. Thank you. And look, it's us or them. That's what it comes down to. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6258.8s)]
*  It's us or them. And it's got to be them, not us. I want to thank you, Jim. You're a great [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6263.360000000001s)]
*  patriot. God bless you, my friend. Do I owe you anything, Mr. Producer? We said. OK, let's go to [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6268.72s)]
*  Joe. Huntingberg, Indiana, XM satellite. Excuse me, Joe, how are you? [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6274.56s)]
*  Hey, Mark, thank you. Longtime listener. First time getting through. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6279.2s)]
*  Thank you. Just wanted to say something. I am an American by choice. I became a U.S. citizen when [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6285.599999999999s)]
*  I joined the military when I was 18, served 20 years. God bless. Five of my seven children [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6292.4s)]
*  are veterans. Wow. So one of the things I wanted to say to you is that your words that we [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6297.92s)]
*  unconditionally surrender, I think that the Mullahs in Iran are. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6307.04s)]
*  The void of intellect and common sense, because they think they have Hiroshima and Nagasaki buried [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6313.6s)]
*  under the ground. And the only thing I would encourage our president to do would be to support [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6320.72s)]
*  Israel and Benjamin Netanyahu and whether we give him the bunker busters or we deliver them [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6328.4s)]
*  based on a lease and he wants them delivered based whatever way he wants. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6336.64s)]
*  This will not stop. I do not think I've got to go, Joe. First of all, thank you and everybody [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6343.68s)]
*  in your family. I don't think you're going to be disappointed. I think the president's going to do [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6349.36s)]
*  exactly what needs to be done. And God bless you, my friend. We'll be right back. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6353.12s)]
*  Folks, I want you to know to feel comfortable and I want all over the country, whether the media, [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6366.88s)]

*  all over the world. Nine out of every 10 callers supports Israel, supports taking out these nuclear [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6378.0s)]
*  sites, the propaganda by the radical left and the fifth column isolation, the propaganda of the [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6386.72s)]
*  left and the fifth column isolationists is just that the propaganda that you see on these sites [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6393.6s)]
*  like Media, Drug, Report or in these news operations is just that the American people want [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6400.64s)]
*  this taken care of. And it's very reflective in this audience. I can tell you that right now. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6406.56s)]
*  What do we got left, Mr. Producer? Ah, OK. You callers, I apologize. We've got a full board, [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNQwiNCtlI&t=6411.92s)]
