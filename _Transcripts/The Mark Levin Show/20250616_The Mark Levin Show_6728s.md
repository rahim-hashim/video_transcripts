Video Description: On Monday’s Mark Levin Show, those exploiting the MAGA movement for personal gain have been exposed. These fake MAGA figures, like Chatsworth Qatarlson (Tucker Carlson), are grifting, lying, and promoting anti-American sentiments while falsely claiming to support America First. They support regimes like Iran and Qatar, which funded terrorism and undermined U.S. interests. Fake MAGA is very upset that their team, Iran, is losing. They want you to believe that patriotism is isolationism. The choice is between real MAGA and fake MAGA. Later, Minister of Strategic Affairs of Israel Ron Dermer calls in to provide an update on the Israel/Iran war.  The highly successful operation targeted Iran’s military nuclear program and missile capabilities. Dermer praises the precision of Israel’s pilots and intelligence, noting the elimination of key terror figures in the operation’s opening minutes, and expresses confidence in achieving Israel’s strategic goals. By confronting Iran, both Israel's and America's futures are being secured. Also, President Trump issued a statement expressing regret that Iran did not sign a nuclear deal he had urged them to accept, calling it a shame and a waste of human life. He emphasized, in all caps, that "IRAN CANNOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON," a stance he has consistently reiterated throughout his political career. He is a non-interventionist commander-in-chief who avoids conflict when possible but is prepared to act decisively to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. We, in real MAGA, real American patriots, stand with Trump, our military, and our Israeli allies! Whatever is happening, we should strongly support our president and our troops, pray for them, speak out for them, and condemn any of the fake MAGA grifters, Marxists, Islamists, and the rest who seek to undermine our country especially at a time like this.  President Trump has made clear that he wants peace, and that the Iranian regime with nuclear weapons is not about peace but genocide.  For the vast majority of Americans, nothing could be clearer.

# Fake MAGA vs. Real Patriots: The Ultimate Showdown
**The Mark Levin Show:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk)
*  Ladies and gentlemen, this next segment of the podcast is brought to you by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=0.0s)]
*  For over 50 years, the Great Heritage Foundation has been America's outpost in Washington, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4.8s)]
*  fighting against the D.C. federal bureaucracy and working to secure a future that allows Americans [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=9.52s)]
*  to live the good life. For too long, common sense principles have been ignored by many of the very [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=14.64s)]
*  leaders claiming to fight for America, but the Heritage Foundation is proud to hold our leaders [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=19.28s)]
*  accountable and stand up for America's founding principles, paid for by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=23.6s)]
*  He's here. Now, broadcasting from the underground command post, deep in the bowels of a hidden [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=30.48s)]
*  bunker, somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=38.0s)]
*  we once again make contact with our leader, Mark LeVein. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=42.56s)]
*  Hello, America. Mark LeVein here, our number 877-381-3811, 877-381-3811. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=120.88s)]
*  I want to thank you. I spent several weeks here, and now they've exposed themselves. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=134.64s)]
*  That is, individuals who have glommed onto the MAGA movement, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=142.48s)]
*  the Donald Trump's movement, to try and hijack it, to try and grift off it, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=145.76s)]
*  to try and whore themselves as a result of it. And we've exposed them, you and I. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  We've exposed them. Most of them are anti-American while they keep talking about America first. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=165.92s)]
*  Israel is winning this war that started Friday evening, as we're on the air here. It's only [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=176.4s)]
*  Monday evening. They have fought a spectacular war thus far. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=181.44s)]
*  Not a single American soldier has been involved in any direct way, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=191.6s)]
*  firing bullets or having bullets fired at them. Thank God. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  And yet the fake MAGA that has spent years lying to you, deceiving you, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=200.88s)]
*  separating you from your money, they're very upset tonight [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=212.32s)]
*  because their team, the Islamo-Nazi regime in Tehran, is losing. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  They have coddled these regimes in the Middle East. They have coddled a war criminal, Putin. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=225.12s)]
*  They want you to believe that patriotism is isolationism, even in the face of a country, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=236.8s)]
*  a regime like Iran, that has killed 603 American soldiers, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=244.96s)]
*  that has maimed thousands of American soldiers, and then fake MAGA is telling you that they [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=254.56s)]
*  stand for the United States military. While they're undermining the United States military [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  and our assets, they're undermining the United States military and our assets. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=266.64s)]
*  And that has been placed throughout the world, not just the Middle East, throughout the world. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=275.04s)]
*  Many of our military assets in the Middle East have nothing to do with Israel. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=282.48s)]
*  Chadwick Guttarlsson, his favorite murderous monarchical regime, has the biggest United [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=289.20000000000005s)]
*  States base in the Middle East. He hasn't said that ought to close down. He hasn't said we ought [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=297.04s)]
*  to withdraw our troops and our jets from that base. No, he's busy wet kissing the dictator monarch [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=302.32s)]
*  of Qatar, which has funded Hamas, which gave aid and comfort and cover and safe haven [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=315.6s)]
*  to the mastermind of 9-11. When our FBI was about to nab him, the Qatari monarchy gave him a passport [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=323.76s)]
*  and a plane out of the country. A year or two later, he attacked us on 9-11. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=332.56s)]
*  Chadwick Guttarlsson sucked up to that monarchy and that regime, and he wants you to believe he's [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=339.52s)]
*  America first, and he wants you to believe he cares about the cops and the firefighters. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=349.2s)]
*  They died in those towers. He wants you to believe he cares about our military, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=353.6s)]
*  about our military, when he could care less. He hasn't called for the closure of the main [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=357.68s)]
*  base in Qatar, has he? That's our biggest base. We're the base in Iraq. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=362.88s)]
*  Israel didn't put the base in Iraq. That base in Iraq isn't there for Israel. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=375.04s)]
*  When we went to war with Iraq, we put the base in Iraq. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=381.20000000000005s)]
*  So why are they focused on Israel, fake MAGA? Because most of them are Jew haters and anti-Semites, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=387.6s)]
*  and most of them are America haters. Not all, not all, but most, starting with Chadwick Guttarlsson. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=397.84000000000003s)]
*  How do they support our troops? By telling them they're not needed? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=412.0s)]
*  Is that how they support our troops? I don't think so. These guys are thugs. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=417.84000000000003s)]
*  When you challenge them in a substantive or intellectual way, they try to smear you. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=428.32000000000005s)]
*  So you got to get down into the gutter and duke it out with them. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=434.8s)]
*  And what President Trump sees, what I see, what more and more people see, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=437.92s)]
*  is that these people are not only paper tigers. They're loathsome, absolutely loathsome. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=447.36s)]
*  Gave nothing in common with you. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=454.8s)]
*  Chadwick Guttarlsson is a trust fund baby from the Swanson frozen food. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=459.76s)]
*  Dynasty. He went to prep school. He's got a preppy, sort of a feminine way about him. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=468.64000000000004s)]
*  The way he speaks, the way he laughs, the way he carries himself. But he wants to be a regular guy, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=479.6s)]
*  you see, so he shows up at UFC events. Regular guy. Tough guy. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=484.16s)]
*  His team is losing. So he trashes Donald Trump. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=490.96000000000004s)]
*  Those of you who voted for Donald Trump, those of you who support his policies, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=503.12s)]
*  those of you who want to defeat the Democrats and the left, he does not. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=508.64s)]
*  Because now he's trashing Donald Trump. It's only a matter of time. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=517.6s)]
*  So are the comedians that surround him and his ilk. Comedians that aren't funny, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=521.3599999999999s)]
*  that don't even tell jokes. They just are a joke. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=527.92s)]
*  And most of them have never lifted a finger for this country. And I don't even mean in battle. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=533.1999999999999s)]
*  I just mean in supporting our troops, supporting our cops, supporting our firefighters. How have they? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=541.92s)]
*  When you are defending a regime in Iran, they're not just opposed to quote unquote war. They are [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=550.8s)]
*  defending right now the regime in Iran. The regime in Iran is about to fall in a few more weeks if the [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=557.68s)]
*  Israelis are left to finish them off. But they think they have a lifeline. In Chatsworth, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=563.92s)]
*  they have a lifeline. In the jokes of these comedians who are podcasters. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=572.0s)]
*  With a young generation of people who happen to be among the most patriotic in the country. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=584.8s)]
*  They feed on them. They lie to them. They sell them. They sell them hate [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=591.2800000000001s)]
*  for their own country, for our military, for Jews. And notice there aren't evangelical [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=600.08s)]
*  Christians among them either. Have you noticed that? The vast majority of evangelical Christians [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=606.1600000000001s)]
*  and evangelical Christian leaders like my dear friend Pastor John Hagee and so many others [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=612.24s)]
*  They don't stand with these reprobates. They want nothing to do with these reprobates. I'll tell you why. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=616.72s)]
*  Evangelical Christians and Christians of people of good faith all over the world and especially [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=625.52s)]
*  in this audience and in this country. They love the Holy Land and they know what will happen to the Holy Land. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=630.24s)]
*  They know what will happen to the birthplace of Judaism and Christianity. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=638.64s)]
*  They know what will happen if the Islamonazis have their way. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=642.96s)]
*  The things I tell you, the things we talk about, they're not imaginary. It's not fear-mongering. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=656.08s)]
*  That's what they do. Were we hit on 9-11 or not? Who hit us? We have a whole TSA program. Every [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=661.6800000000001s)]
*  time you get on an airplane you have to be hassled and so forth. Why is that? To protect [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=668.48s)]
*  us from Jews and Christians or Islamists and jihadis? Who is it that's trying to assassinate [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=673.2s)]
*  our president? Marxists, madmen and Islamists based in Tehran. That's reality. That's a fact. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=680.5600000000001s)]
*  Now we all know. We all know of this ilk. We all know what we're dealing with here. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=689.28s)]
*  A cancer, a poison. We've got Marxists, we've got Islamists and these anti-American, un-American [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=696.88s)]
*  isolationists who just like the Islamists and the Marxists use the American flag, wreck themselves [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=706.24s)]
*  in the American army and they're going to be killed. They're going to be killed. They're going to be [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=712.64s)]
*  wrecked themselves in the American flag and insist that you agree with them or you're not a patriot. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=718.16s)]
*  What have they done to support our military? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=728.96s)]
*  Other than say, don't use our military. Obviously it's a very serious matter when our military [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=733.36s)]
*  is entered into combat and we elected a man, Donald Trump, our commander in chief, who's well [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=742.7199999999999s)]
*  aware of that. We know what he did in his first term, but people forget in his first term, the same [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=748.9599999999999s)]
*  fake MAGA, the same Qatarisins among others, trashed him and attacked him. When he took out [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=755.8399999999999s)]
*  Soleimani, who was Soleimani? Soleimani was the chief organizer, strategist for the Iranian [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=764.88s)]
*  military and intelligence attacks around the world. He was the right hand of Khomeini. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=775.68s)]
*  He was killing our soldiers. He was maiming our soldiers. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=783.76s)]
*  Trump took him out and Qatarisins and his ilk attacked Trump, said they would start World War III. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=786.8s)]
*  Well, is there World War III? And by the way, tell me which Arab country wants to join with Iran? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=796.64s)]
*  Not one, maybe Qatar. And maybe if Qatarisins likes Qatar so much, rather than hiding in Maine [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=802.9599999999999s)]
*  in his little hovel, maybe he should go there. Well, he'll be fully welcomed. Or maybe he can [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=813.52s)]
*  go to Moscow where he likes the subway system. Just a thought, as he basically lives in hiding. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=820.88s)]
*  He's a weird, perverse dude, weird. It's okay. He's unraveling. He's panicking. He's going to [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=830.3199999999999s)]
*  a couple of his friends, some of whom are my friends, I thought. He's going to a couple of [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=840.96s)]
*  his friends. And he relies on a few of these, these website phony news operations to give him [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=847.12s)]

*  threat that you can't deal with. He said the other day in one of his interviews that Churchill [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=1252.08s)]
*  talked about a jarring gong. It wakes up democracies. Well we don't want to be gonged and that's why we [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=1257.1200000000001s)]

*  threat of Iran's military nuclear program and also the threat of their ballistic missile program and [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=1271.28s)]
*  some of your listeners if they get to their television screens or online can see what these [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=1278.0s)]
*  one ton missiles the kind of damage they can do and kind of destroy a whole neighborhood. Now imagine [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=1282.88s)]
*  that Iran would have 10,000 of those missiles or 20,000 of those missiles. That in itself [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=1288.56s)]
*  would be an existential threat. So we launched that attack early Friday morning. It was extremely [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=1294.88s)]
*  successful. It actually exceeded our expectations and we had pretty high expectations but I think [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=1300.8s)]
*  no offense I think we had probably the best pilots in the world and I think our intel was terrific [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=1306.3999999999999s)]
*  and we were able to take out a lot of these terror masters in the first several minutes of the battle [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=1312.1599999999999s)]

*  going to achieve our goals and I'm confident that we will. So remind the American people what are [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=1324.08s)]
*  your key goals here? Well Iran is a regime that openly calls and actively works towards the [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=1328.8s)]
*  destruction of Israel and they are building a nuclear weapon. That's why they've invested [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=1336.32s)]
*  billions of dollars into this program. That's why they build these massive facilities underneath [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=1342.72s)]
*  mountains. It's not because they want peaceful nuclear energy. You know they got enough oil. The [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=1349.44s)]
*  whole idea that they need peaceful nuclear energy is is patently ridiculous but even if they wanted [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=1353.6s)]
*  and they do have one nuclear facility that's fine let them have peaceful nuclear energy. What they [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=1358.72s)]
*  don't have to do is have an industrial size enrichment program and the reason why they have [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=1364.64s)]
*  that is because they want nuclear weapons. In the last four years Iran has enriched a high level [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=1369.92s)]
*  of uranium. Enriched uranium to a high level enough for nine atomic bombs. They have enough [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=1377.6000000000001s)]
*  enriched uranium overall for 17 almost 18 atomic bombs. This is not a peaceful nuclear energy [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=1383.68s)]
*  program and what we saw is how in recent years they're doing more and more high enrichment [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=1390.3200000000002s)]
*  and then in the last few months Mark we could see in our intelligence and this is intelligence [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=1395.52s)]
*  that we share with the United States that Iran was taking steps in its nuclear weaponization [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=1399.92s)]
*  program where you actually take that enriched uranium and you weaponize it. It was taking steps [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=1406.5600000000002s)]
*  that it had never taken before. So we can just sit back and wait and pretend like they're not [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=1411.28s)]
*  going to build a nuclear weapon and hope for the best or we can act and I think the test of [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=1416.96s)]
*  leadership is to act to afford a danger in time and the prime minister has been warning the world [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=1422.32s)]

*  deaf to this and he warned and he warned and he warned and then when he was a prime minister [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=1444.8s)]
*  he's our longest serving prime minister as you know some 18 years and he acted in different [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=1450.32s)]
*  operations with the United States separate from the United States to delay the program. He didn't [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=1455.44s)]
*  stop it but he delayed it. He did everything he could to prevent us having to have this confrontation [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=1459.68s)]
*  and remember that speech to congress that he gave that was a decade ago where the world was [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=1466.88s)]
*  going to do a deal that would allow Iran not just to sneak in or break into a nuclear weapon but to [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=1471.68s)]
*  just walk into a nuclear weapon which is why we opposed it and thank god president trump opposed [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=1478.64s)]
*  that deal and thank god he left this deal or we would in much worse situation today. So we delayed [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=1484.0s)]
*  it and delayed it and delayed it for years even a decade but at some point delay is not enough. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=1489.3600000000001s)]
*  You got to work to thwart it and to stop it and that's what Israel is doing right now and we [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=1496.16s)]
*  started that operation Friday. We're on day four of this operation and we're going to achieve the [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=1500.5600000000002s)]

*  I had to put a pause on it when I got injured for about two and a half months because I couldn't sit up and write [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2369.2s)]
*  but it gave me a lot of opportunity to continue to think through different different issues and [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2378.16s)]
*  I just think those of you who've listened to this program over the years even those of you are newly here [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2384.16s)]

*  MAGA not MAGA that sort of thing this book is about [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2395.16s)]
*  it's evergreen [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2398.16s)]
*  our survival what we have to do to survive is a free country [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2401.16s)]
*  it has history it has philosophy [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2406.12s)]
*  talks about government talks about politics and the big sense of politics [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2408.12s)]
*  talks about liberty where does liberty come from how do you maintain it talks about rights where do rights come from how do you maintain it [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2414.12s)]
*  it's of course important in fact it's not a necessity [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2421.12s)]
*  to address issues like faith because faith [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2425.12s)]
*  plays a big role in what kind of a country you live in [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2429.12s)]
*  and you'll hear about some of that a lot of that about our founding [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2434.08s)]
*  versus Marxism and Islamism [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2438.08s)]
*  and my goal in this book [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2441.08s)]
*  which is a little less than 200 pages long [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2444.08s)]
*  it is really packed full of information but it is written in plain English it's written for you in this audience [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2449.08s)]
*  is to really [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2457.08s)]
*  give one last big push [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2461.04s)]
*  you know I could get hit by a truck tomorrow some people they'd be thrilled with that but nonetheless [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2464.04s)]
*  to really do what our public schools don't do what our colleges don't do and it's provide [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2469.04s)]
*  a very important learning experience and educational information and what I hope is a [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2476.04s)]
*  gripping intriguing entertaining way [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2482.04s)]
*  I'll give you an example [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2488.0s)]
*  this past summer [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2491.0s)]
*  my wife was reading JD Vance's book [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2494.0s)]
*  and she was intrigued with it [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2499.0s)]
*  now this book isn't about my life like it was with JD but there were certain things he said and so forth and so on [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2501.0s)]
*  that were very interesting and very compelling so as we're sitting there [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2507.0s)]
*  on the beach or by a pool [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2512.0s)]
*  or at lunch or dinner table [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2515.0s)]
*  she was going through the book and she reads really quickly [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2518.0s)]
*  three or four days in that case [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2521.0s)]
*  she would quote from the book it's not the first time she's done that or I've done it with her [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2524.0s)]
*  and I feel this book will be the same way again it's not it's not about me personally but [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2530.0s)]
*  it's a scholarly book [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2536.0s)]
*  but it doesn't have to be for scholars [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2538.0s)]
*  it's a smart book but it doesn't have to be for the smartest guy in the room [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2541.0s)]
*  you don't need a college education you can have a college education it doesn't matter [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2545.0s)]
*  this is a diverse audience and I write these books for you [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2549.0s)]
*  so my point is this book on power will really help you understand [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2553.0s)]
*  what your nation was founded on it will help you understand why I make the arguments I make why I take on fake [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2559.0s)]
*  MAGA stand for real MAGA and again it's not even about MAGA [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2565.0s)]
*  I get into deep discussions about the judges and the court system our constitutional construct [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2570.0s)]
*  we get all kinds of just fascinating information from my perspective [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2575.0s)]
*  and tonight we're going to finish the last audio part of the book as I've told you I'm doing the audio of the entire book [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2580.0s)]
*  so at 10pm tonight until we're done one or two in the morning whatever it is [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2587.0s)]
*  the audio version will be completed [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2591.0s)]
*  and as we do the audio and Mr. Producer hears it for the first time [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2594.0s)]
*  his ears perk up as I read through it again for the 400th time [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2598.0s)]
*  but I've never read it out loud [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2603.0s)]
*  I go you know what it's a damn good book I did the best I could [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2606.0s)]
*  this book comes out on July 29th I want to encourage you to pre-order it [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2610.0s)]

*  on the blaze on Fox on all various other platforms [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2620.0s)]
*  so I think you're going to like this book [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2625.0s)]
*  it's priced right it's less than $24 right now and will be discounted further I have no doubt [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2628.0s)]
*  now the President of the United States just put out a statement [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2635.0s)]
*  he put out a statement while this program was airing [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2639.0s)]
*  he put it out at 6.30pm [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2642.0s)]
*  and it says the following [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2647.0s)]
*  Iran should have signed the deal [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2650.0s)]
*  I told them to sign [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2653.0s)]
*  what a shame and waste of human life [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2655.0s)]
*  simply stated and he puts in caps Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2659.0s)]
*  now the President's only said this every day he's been in public office [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2663.0s)]
*  or he's run for public office [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2667.0s)]
*  he said I said it over and over again [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2669.0s)]
*  everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2674.0s)]
*  we moved additional assets in the region [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2680.0s)]
*  I don't know if something's going to happen tonight or imminently [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2686.0s)]
*  but it sounds like something is imminent [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2690.0s)]
*  now if you're red-blooded patriotic American [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2693.0s)]
*  what goes through your mind? [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2696.0s)]
*  what goes through your mind? [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2700.0s)]
*  you voted for Donald Trump [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2702.0s)]
*  you have faith in the Commander Chief [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2704.0s)]
*  the way you had faith in Ronald Reagan [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2706.0s)]
*  the way our parents and parents had faith in Dwight Eisenhower and others [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2708.0s)]
*  he's the man, he's the Commander in Chief [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2714.0s)]
*  and we should take some heart in knowing that this is a man who doesn't want military conflict [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2717.0s)]
*  this is a man who avoids as much as he can [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2723.0s)]
*  he's not an interventionist [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2728.0s)]
*  and so you know if he's going to take steps [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2732.0s)]
*  it's because those steps need to be taken [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2735.0s)]
*  we should rally around him at a time like this [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2739.0s)]
*  not attack him [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2742.0s)]
*  this is the problem when you have ties to Qatar [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2744.0s)]
*  I don't mean Qatar generally but the kind of ties that some of the reprobates have [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2748.0s)]
*  this is what happens when you have ties to Putin [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2752.0s)]
*  this is what happens when you're an ideologue who just runs around and keeps talking about forever wars [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2755.0s)]
*  this is not going to be a forever war [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2760.0s)]
*  this war is going to be over [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2763.0s)]
*  not only in your lifetime [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2765.0s)]
*  it's going to be over in a month, maybe less, I don't know [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2767.0s)]
*  it may be one of the shortest wars in modern history [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2771.0s)]
*  the issue isn't whether this war is a forever war [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2776.0s)]
*  or the shortest war in modern history [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2779.0s)]
*  the issue isn't even if we're helping our Israeli friends who are helping us by trying to take this regime out [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2782.0s)]
*  the issue is who's side are you on? [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2787.0s)]
*  the practical facts are [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2790.0s)]
*  we have fighting men and women in the region [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2793.0s)]
*  we had fighting men and women in the region [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2796.0s)]
*  who had nothing to do with Iran [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2799.0s)]
*  they're there in Qatar, they're there in Iraq [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2802.0s)]
*  they're in other places in the region [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2805.0s)]
*  we have had our ships in the Mediterranean [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2808.0s)]
*  in the Middle East, in the Middle East [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2811.0s)]
*  we have had our ships in the Mediterranean [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2814.0s)]
*  and other places [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2817.0s)]
*  because our ships have a right to navigate [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2820.0s)]
*  and it was the Islamist Nazis who kept attacking our ships [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2823.0s)]
*  backed by Iran [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2826.0s)]
*  it's not hard to know who the good guys are and the bad guys are [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2829.0s)]
*  the bad guys are the Islamist Nazis that have attacked us and attacked our military [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2833.0s)]
*  and we [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2838.0s)]
*  the American Republic [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2842.0s)]
*  and the Israeli parliamentary democracy [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2845.0s)]
*  at least that's what it's supposed to be, but you get my point [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2848.0s)]
*  we know what evil is [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2851.0s)]
*  it's them, not us [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2854.0s)]
*  we know what bad is, it's them, not us [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2857.0s)]
*  we're good [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=2860.0s)]

*  I don't know what's happened to them [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3749.0s)]
*  that said [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3752.0s)]
*  other than battling them I literally want nothing to do with them [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3755.0s)]
*  I'm not around bigots and racists and anti-Semites [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3758.0s)]
*  I want nothing to do with them, nothing [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3761.0s)]
*  remember years ago [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3764.0s)]
*  with my mother and father [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3767.0s)]
*  somebody we knew used the N-word [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3770.0s)]
*  and my dad looked at the guy and said don't use that word around me [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3773.0s)]
*  he said well Jack you don't use that word around me [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3776.0s)]
*  I didn't even know what it was [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3779.0s)]
*  I was like 8 or 9 years old I didn't even know what it meant [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3782.0s)]
*  now I know [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3785.0s)]
*  that's how I was raised [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3788.0s)]
*  I can tell you Dick Carlson [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3791.0s)]
*  I didn't know well, I knew a little bit [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3794.0s)]
*  he worked in the Reagan administration [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3797.0s)]
*  I told you the other day as did I [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3800.0s)]
*  I met him twice [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3803.0s)]
*  he was a very kind man, really smart [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3806.0s)]
*  very entertaining and engaging [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3809.0s)]
*  he was a hawk [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3812.0s)]
*  he was a rabid anti-communist [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3815.0s)]
*  he was vice chairman of the board of directors [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3818.0s)]
*  the foundation for the defense of democracies [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3821.0s)]
*  which is now attacked as a warmonger institution [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3824.0s)]
*  I'm talking about [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3827.0s)]
*  Carlson's father [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3830.0s)]
*  he was appointed by Reagan to head the voice of America [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3833.0s)]
*  to spread democracy and freedom throughout the world [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3836.0s)]
*  he was a huge huge supporter of the state of Israel [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3839.0s)]
*  and unfortunately passed away a few months ago [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3842.0s)]
*  I hadn't known until after the fact that he passed away [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3845.0s)]
*  it's too bad [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3848.0s)]
*  we're losing these guys and gals who helped defeat the Soviet Union [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3851.0s)]
*  that's the other, what do these people do? They're all people [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3854.0s)]
*  who talks like this? [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3857.0s)]
*  they defeated the Soviet Union, that was a big deal [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3860.0s)]
*  most of the people who make these comments haven't defeated anything [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3863.0s)]
*  they haven't done anything [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3869.0s)]
*  quite frankly [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3872.0s)]
*  very bizarre [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3875.0s)]
*  you've got comedians [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3878.0s)]
*  you've got a guy who can't hold a job [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3881.0s)]
*  and he seems to [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3884.0s)]
*  you know, I'll tell you what to listen to [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3887.0s)]
*  Rabbi Botech [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3890.0s)]
*  it's spelled Bo Teach but it's Botech [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3893.0s)]
*  I put it on my video and I put it on my sites [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3896.0s)]
*  I really want you to check it out [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3899.0s)]
*  in a couple of minutes he summarized [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3902.0s)]
*  everything that needed to be summarized just a few days ago [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3905.0s)]
*  he's a good man, I like him a lot [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3908.0s)]
*  and his name is Shmueli Botech [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3911.0s)]
*  is that Irish Mr. Producer? [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3914.0s)]
*  is it Italian? Is there more Jewish name than Shmueli? [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3917.0s)]
*  I'm just saying, but Shmueli Botech, this guy's sharp [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3920.0s)]
*  he's a fighter [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3923.0s)]
*  and a rabbi [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3926.0s)]
*  and you want to see the greatest take down [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3929.0s)]
*  of Katarelson, it's right there [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3932.0s)]
*  you know the greatest take down of Katarelson is Katarelson [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3935.0s)]
*  quite frankly [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3938.0s)]
*  it truly is [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3941.0s)]
*  here's President Trump in Canada today, cut to go [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3944.0s)]
*  have you heard any signals or seen any messages [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3947.0s)]
*  that Iran wishes to escalate the conflict [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3950.0s)]
*  what have you heard from the Iranians [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3953.0s)]
*  they'd like to talk [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3956.0s)]
*  but they should have done that before [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3959.0s)]
*  I had 60 days and they had 60 days [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3962.0s)]
*  and on the 61st day I said we don't have a deal [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3965.0s)]
*  they have to make a deal [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3968.0s)]
*  it's painful for both parties but I'd say Iran is [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3971.0s)]
*  not winning this war [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3974.0s)]
*  they should talk immediately before it's too late [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3977.0s)]
*  and what would you say in your opinion, what would it take [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3980.0s)]
*  for the US to get involved in this conflict militarily [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3983.0s)]
*  I don't want to talk about that [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3986.0s)]
*  CNN is reporting the President [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3989.0s)]
*  is leaving Canada [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3992.0s)]
*  the G7 early now [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3995.0s)]
*  to come back to DC [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=3998.0s)]
*  looks like we've moved some additional assets in place [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4001.0s)]
*  the Prime Minister and the President [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4004.0s)]
*  told the citizens of Tehran [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4007.0s)]
*  to get out of Tehran [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4010.0s)]
*  it's not hard to read those tea leaves [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4013.0s)]
*  and this explains why the [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4016.0s)]
*  un-American isolationists [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4019.0s)]
*  are in full desperate panicky attack mode [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4022.0s)]
*  they do not want us to win [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4025.0s)]
*  they do not want us to win [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4028.0s)]
*  they do not want us to win [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4031.0s)]
*  I'm just telling you [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4034.0s)]
*  and we need to be aware of that [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4037.0s)]
*  the pro-Tehran [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4040.0s)]
*  propagandists, these isolationists [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4043.0s)]
*  are driving everything [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4046.0s)]
*  to sow division [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4049.0s)]
*  give an example [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4052.0s)]
*  from Adam Crado [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4055.0s)]
*  just give me a second [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4059.0s)]
*  there's a lot of stuff pouring over the transom here [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4062.0s)]
*  and there's a lot going on [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4065.0s)]
*  sources tell us that a meeting yesterday [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4068.0s)]
*  between US Ambassador Mike Huckabay [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4071.0s)]
*  and the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4074.0s)]
*  devolved into a shouting match over Netanyahu's objections [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4077.0s)]
*  to US plans to evacuate our citizens from Israel [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4080.0s)]
*  and the wider region [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4083.0s)]
*  Netanyahu's objection was predicated on the desire to hold US citizens at risk [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4086.0s)]
*  in order to increase the likelihood of US entry into Israel's conflict [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4089.0s)]
*  did that happen? [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4092.0s)]
*  the State Department said this is a vicious lie [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4095.0s)]
*  there has never been a shouting match [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4098.0s)]
*  between Netanyahu and Huckabay [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4101.0s)]
*  the notion that Israel is trying to hold American citizens is absurd [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4104.0s)]
*  these are trying times for all of us [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4107.0s)]
*  and no one needs false prophets peddling wild stories [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4110.0s)]
*  that are laughable for their untruths [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4113.0s)]
*  and this is the way it goes [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4116.0s)]
*  and this is the way it's been going [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4119.0s)]
*  the embeds for the hate America isolationists [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4122.0s)]
*  have been leaking, they've been leaking to outlets such as Axios [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4125.0s)]
*  they've been leaking to Politico [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4128.0s)]
*  they've been leaking to certain websites [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4131.0s)]
*  the Entrel media I call them [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4134.0s)]
*  and they put out these lies, this propaganda [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4137.0s)]
*  this is the middle of a war [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4140.0s)]
*  if you know Mike Huckabay, he never raises his voice [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4143.0s)]
*  if you know Netanyahu [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4146.0s)]
*  he loves Huckabay and he loves Trump [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4149.0s)]
*  and he's not going to raise his voice with them either [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4152.0s)]
*  and so this is a lie [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4155.0s)]
*  and just think about what they're saying [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4158.0s)]
*  that Israel is insisting holding American citizens in Israel [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4161.0s)]
*  so they can't get out [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4164.0s)]
*  and they're not going to allow you [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4167.0s)]
*  and you would have heard about it by now [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4170.0s)]
*  but it's a flat out lie, the state department said that never happened [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4173.0s)]
*  that's not true, Netanyahu, what is this? [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4176.0s)]
*  a lie? yes! [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4179.0s)]
*  and it's coming from the hate America isolationists [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4182.0s)]

*  they're a weak underbelly [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4479.0s)]
*  in many ways they're a fifth column [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4482.0s)]
*  they just are [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4485.0s)]
*  I think they've given aid and comfort [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4488.0s)]
*  to the enemy in the sense that they have encouraged the enemy [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4491.0s)]
*  to resist, even now [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4494.0s)]

*  if we're moving additional assets in [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4506.0s)]
*  if as the reports are accurate [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4509.0s)]
*  the president's going to leave Canada early to come back to Washington [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4512.0s)]

*  pro-Americans [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4536.0s)]
*  I think somebody needs to look into that in a significant way [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4539.0s)]
*  where they're getting their money from, who they're associated with, all this stuff [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4542.0s)]
*  because this isn't normal, Russia used to always say follow the money [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=4545.0s)]

*  you've heard that phrase, right? [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5095.0s)]
*  that in many cases what's good for the United States is good for Israel [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5098.0s)]
*  what's good for Israel is good for the United States [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5101.0s)]
*  Nisrallah killed more Americans [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5104.0s)]
*  than he has Israelis [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5107.0s)]
*  it's really pathetic [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5115.0s)]
*  I've told you before, Donald Trump is a historic figure [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5118.0s)]
*  he's an iconic figure [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5121.0s)]
*  he's a remarkable man [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5124.0s)]
*  they bring in these retired [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5127.0s)]
*  lieutenant colonels and others [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5130.0s)]
*  radio and TV who are radical leftists [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5133.0s)]
*  tell you that Donald Trump is for peace [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5136.0s)]
*  he never agreed to this [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5139.0s)]
*  Donald Trump said no nukes [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5142.0s)]
*  and no nukes means peace [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5145.0s)]
*  remember what Ron Dermer said [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5148.0s)]
*  he was born in this country [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5151.0s)]
*  and he's the minister of strategic affairs [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5154.0s)]
*  for the prime minister of Israel now [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5157.0s)]
*  for the isolationists, this isn't about America first [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5163.0s)]
*  this is about America dead [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5166.0s)]
*  that's what it is [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5171.0s)]
*  Netanyahu on Fox yesterday [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5174.0s)]
*  with Bret Baer, cut six Mr. Producer [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5177.0s)]
*  go [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5180.0s)]
*  you just said Iran tried to assassinate President Trump twice [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5183.0s)]
*  do you have intel that the assassination attempts on President Trump [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5186.0s)]
*  were directly from Iran? [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5189.0s)]
*  no, I would just say this to Bret [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5192.0s)]
*  yes, I have information, not intel [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5195.0s)]
*  I have the court records [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5198.0s)]
*  we charge these guys [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5201.0s)]
*  we, the United States government charge [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5204.0s)]
*  it's not complicated, go ahead [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5207.0s)]
*  through proxies, yes [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5210.0s)]
*  through their intel, yes, they want to kill him [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5213.0s)]
*  look, he's enemy number one [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5216.0s)]
*  he's a decisive leader [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5219.0s)]
*  he never took the path that others took to try to bargain with him [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5222.0s)]
*  in a way that is weak [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5225.0s)]
*  he took the path to enrich uranium [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5228.0s)]
*  which means a pathway to the bomb [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5231.0s)]
*  he took up this fake agreement [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5234.0s)]
*  he killed Qasem Soleimani [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5237.0s)]
*  he made it very clear, including now [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5240.0s)]
*  you cannot have a nuclear weapon, which means you cannot enrich [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5243.0s)]
*  he's been very forceful, so for them [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5246.0s)]
*  he's enemy number one [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5249.0s)]
*  look, they also tried to kill me, but I'm his junior partner [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5252.0s)]
*  he's a great threat to Iran's plans to [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5255.0s)]
*  weaponize nuclear weapons and use them [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5258.0s)]
*  and he is [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5261.0s)]
*  and hopefully after tonight or tomorrow night [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5264.0s)]
*  or whatever is happening, whenever it's done [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5267.0s)]
*  this will be over with [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5270.0s)]
*  and I love it, it could sow chaos [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5273.0s)]
*  really? [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5276.0s)]
*  every excuse not to defeat evil [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5279.0s)]
*  be World War III? Apparently not [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5282.0s)]
*  a wider regional war? Apparently not [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5285.0s)]
*  it could sow chaos? It might [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5288.0s)]
*  but isn't that the definition of the Middle East? [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5291.0s)]
*  as long as they don't have an atomic weapon [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5294.0s)]
*  or nuclear weapon I should say in Iran, it seems to me to be worth it [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5297.0s)]
*  just my opinion [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5300.0s)]
*  I'll be right back [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5303.0s)]
*  the real [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5309.0s)]

*  just to reiterate here because [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5321.0s)]
*  we do have a pretty big presence with all of you out there, which is wonderful [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5324.0s)]
*  we in real [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5327.0s)]

*  whatever is happening [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5336.0s)]
*  we should strongly support our president and our troops, pray for them [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5339.0s)]
*  speak out for them [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5342.0s)]

*  who seek to undermine our country [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5348.0s)]
*  especially at a time like this [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5351.0s)]
*  President Trump has made clear that he wants peace [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5354.0s)]
*  that the Iranian regime with nuclear weapons is not about peace [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5357.0s)]
*  but genocide [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5360.0s)]
*  for the vast majority of Americans [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5363.0s)]

*  we're in alliance with Israel [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5507.0s)]
*  and Israel is in alliance with us [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5510.0s)]
*  not because Israel has a lot of money [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5513.0s)]
*  does everything come down to that? [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=5516.0s)]

*  this is a cult, it's a cabal but it's a cult [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6044.0s)]
*  MAGA is not a cult [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6047.0s)]

*  he's leading a movement [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6056.0s)]
*  but as soon as Donald Trump looked at the facts [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6059.0s)]
*  and made decisions for himself [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6062.0s)]

*  and against forever wars, this is about peace [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6128.0s)]

*  they scratched the bottom of the barrel [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6140.0s)]
*  in 2016 Mark Levin said he was another Trump [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6143.0s)]
*  how many times have I explained this? [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6146.0s)]

*  who have come to like, I don't know him personally [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6152.0s)]
*  but anybody who faces a SWAT team [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6155.0s)]
*  with the courage that he did [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6158.0s)]
*  is a good guy [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6164.0s)]
*  I don't care about anything else [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6167.0s)]
*  for all I know he's been attacking me, doesn't matter [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6170.0s)]
*  but he did attack me [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6173.0s)]
*  wrongly at that time [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6176.0s)]
*  and I thought he was a consultant [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6179.0s)]
*  for Donald Trump [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6182.0s)]
*  and I laid into Roger and I laid into Trump [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6185.0s)]
*  one night on the radio show and I said I'm announcing as an ever Trump [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6188.0s)]
*  Donald Trump called me on the phone [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6191.0s)]
*  and he said Roger is not my consultant [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6194.0s)]
*  I don't agree with what he said about you or anything like that [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6197.0s)]
*  and the next night I announced, okay I'm back [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6200.0s)]
*  right Mr. Bideaux, is that like that? [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6203.0s)]
*  done, this is the best they can hang on [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6206.0s)]
*  best, that's what they, he was never a Trump [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6209.0s)]
*  I was never a never Trump [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6212.0s)]
*  the Republican primary in 2015-16 [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6215.0s)]

*  Marco Rubio about the hand stuff [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6221.0s)]
*  Marco Rubio is now Secretary of State [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6224.0s)]
*  JD Vance has said the most horrendous things about Donald Trump [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6227.0s)]
*  even using the Hitler word [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6230.0s)]
*  he's now Vice President of the United States [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6233.0s)]
*  I've never done any of those things to Donald Trump [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6236.0s)]
*  but primaries are tough [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6239.0s)]
*  I supported Ted Cruz, Ted Cruz and Donald Trump [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6242.0s)]

*  basic belief systems [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6251.0s)]
*  this should not be complicated [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6254.0s)]
*  this isn't a close call [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6257.0s)]
*  you have Islamo-Nazis [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6260.0s)]

*  or tomorrow night and saying, I want to go to war [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1aH_YpO1bk&t=6313.0s)]
