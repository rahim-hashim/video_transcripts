Video Description: On Monday’s Mark Levin Show, the catastrophic flash flooding along the Guadalupe River in Central Texas over the weekend claimed at least 91 lives, with around 20 people still missing. The disaster struck Kerr County, particularly devastating Camp Mystic, an all-girls Christian summer camp, where 27 campers and counselors, including young teens and the camp director, perished while trying to save others.  It’s disgusting that the media and Democrats immediately politicize the event, blaming climate change or budget cuts. Also, there’s a fake MAGA faction within conservatism that harbors dangerous ideologies, including affinities for Hitler sympathizers and antisemitic rhetoric. Darryl Cooper promotes revisionist history, such as portraying Churchill as a villain and Hitler as misunderstood. Later, the big, beautiful bill is not perfect, but it’s pretty good. Republicans didn’t have enough votes to cut anymore. Democrats are trying to tell you there are Medicaid cuts. No, it’s cutting off people who shouldn’t be getting Medicaid. A Convention of States can fix systemic spending issues. Afterward, a district judge in Boston issued a temporary restraining order blocking the defunding of Planned Parenthood as part of the big, beautiful bill President Trump signed. This ruling, which contradicts a Supreme Court decision limiting nationwide injunctions by lower courts, violates constitutional separation of powers. Congress and the president, as elected branches, have the authority to defund organizations, not a district judge.   Finally, FBI Director Kash Patel, Deputy Director Dan Bongino, and Attorney General Pam Bondi aren’t covering up a Jeffrey Epstein "client list" after a DOJ-FBI memo denied its existence and reaffirmed Epstein's suicide. These three have integrity and lack a motive for a cover-up.

# Camp Mystic Catastrophe: When Tragedy Meets Political Opportunism
**The Mark Levin Show:** [July 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo)
*  The radical left's agendas are attacking your American values, but conservatives like you haven't forgotten what this country was built on. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=0.0s)]
*  My friends, the Heritage Foundation exists to make sure your voice is heard and to represent your values in the swamp and quagmire of D.C. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=7.0s)]
*  The Heritage Foundation stands for your values and will not give up the fight because they know you never will. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=15.0s)]
*  Paid for by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=22.0s)]
*  The Heritage Foundation is a non-command puzzle. Deep in the bowels of a hidden bunker, somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building, we once again make contact with our leader, Mark LeVein. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=30.0s)]

*  The Heritage Foundation is a non-command puzzle. Deep in the bowels of a hidden bunker, somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building, we once again make contact with our leader, Mark LeVein. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=110.0s)]
*  Hello America, Mark LeVein here, our number 877-381-3811, 877-381-3811. You know, hope you had a good weekend. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=117.0s)]
*  This thing in Texas is so horrific. This flooding, these little kids at camp, obviously adults too. Camp counselors not older than 16, 17 years old. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=129.0s)]
*  The camp director trying to save lives and he dies, other people trying to save lives and they die. Not just the camp, people in the community. The flooding is really shocking. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=143.0s)]
*  For those of us who don't live in and around these flood zones, absolutely shocking. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=159.0s)]
*  But I'll tell you what, I've grown to really have nothing but contempt for politicians, most of them, and the media. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=168.0s)]
*  I really have. I mean, if you're a mother or father, grandfather, grandmother, you think about your kids and you think about situations like that, you'd give your life to save your child, you would, or your grandchild, and people did. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=178.0s)]
*  And they're still looking for people and they're still looking for bodies. We're at 91, 91 dead. That's a ton of people. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=197.0s)]
*  With a score or so, still missing. Some of them they can't identify, but they have found. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=208.0s)]
*  And if you're like me, and I think most of you are, you're wondering what were these people thinking when they went under and they figured they couldn't come back up? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=219.0s)]
*  What a horrendous way to go. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=230.0s)]
*  Were their bodies slammed into trees or God knows what? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=233.0s)]
*  Now, the media jump right in. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=242.0s)]
*  Who's to blame? And of course it's Trump. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=251.0s)]
*  And it's the cuts, quote unquote, it's climate change. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=255.0s)]
*  The left never gives up. They just don't abandon this stuff. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=261.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter how many die. It doesn't matter the circumstances. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=266.0s)]
*  It's like the open borders, but God knows how many women have been raped, sold into sex slavery, little kids, 325,000. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=271.0s)]
*  They just keep at it. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=282.0s)]
*  I've got a thing here from Axios where the Democrat Party base is demanding violence from Democrats. Do whatever you have to do. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=285.0s)]
*  This is a complete disintegration of the civil society, of law and order, the rule of law. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=295.0s)]
*  And we've been living through this year after year, day after day, with these politicians defund the police, the police are racist, and just this constant drumbeat. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=305.0s)]
*  And it has an impact on a society. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=317.0s)]
*  And the people who are beating the drums are in the media. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=321.0s)]
*  They have these political platforms. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=326.0s)]
*  It just boggles the mind to see this kind of tragedy and then to hear how some respond. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=330.0s)]
*  It's like they just don't give a damn. They say they do, but they obviously don't. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=340.0s)]
*  Power hungry. It's all this. They're power hungry. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=347.0s)]
*  Looking for an opportunity. Here's Joaquin Castro. He's Democrat. He's from the San Antonio area. This is not that far from San Antonio. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=350.0s)]
*  He's home with Dana Bash. Dana Bash is a louse. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=360.0s)]
*  This whole CNN crew and MSNBC crew, the whole damn bunch of them, and they're not alone. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=365.0s)]
*  They have ice water running through their veins. They're cold as cold can be. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=373.0s)]
*  Cut three, go. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=379.0s)]
*  How much do you think the changing climate is part of what we are seeing go on here? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=380.0s)]
*  Not just what we're seeing in the pictures that we're showing on the screen, but even the flood that you talked about in San Antonio. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=387.0s)]
*  She's a complete ignoramus because this is an area that floods. Floods a lot. Maybe not to this extent. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=394.0s)]
*  They talked about 40 years ago or so. But climate change, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, heat waves, cold wave, climate change. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=400.0s)]
*  She goes right to the talking points. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=410.0s)]
*  Do we just spend trillions of dollars on climate change? What did that get us exactly? Nothing. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=415.0s)]
*  It lined the pockets of left-wing organizations and left-wing politicians pretending they're running organizations. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=420.0s)]
*  Where'd all that money go? It created massive inflation, massive debt. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=428.0s)]
*  Climate change. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=435.0s)]
*  Anyway, go ahead. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=440.0s)]
*  I think climate change is obviously a part of it. These floods are happening more often in more parts of the country and really all over the world. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=443.0s)]
*  And so we have to face that reality and be better prepared for it and combat it. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=453.0s)]
*  First of all, we don't know that that's true at all. I don't know that that's true at all. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=458.0s)]
*  But even if that is true, it's not climate change. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=464.0s)]
*  Here's Betsy Klein, a reporter on CNN Today, Cut for a Go. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=474.0s)]
*  As we track the federal response to this flooding and its third day of recovery efforts, there are a couple of important questions to follow here. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=478.0s)]
*  Number one is the National Weather Service. This is the agency that is responsible for the country's weather forecasting. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=488.0s)]
*  They issued a series of alerts on Friday in those very early hours saying there is going to be life-threatening flooding. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=495.0s)]
*  Now, it's unclear how many people they were able to reach with those warnings. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=504.0s)]
*  We heard in that news conference that there are some people that didn't even have cell service where they were who were impacted. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=509.0s)]
*  It's also the middle of the night. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=516.0s)]
*  What's also unclear is whether cuts to this agency impacted how those warnings were disseminated. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=518.0s)]
*  Cuts to the agency. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=524.0s)]
*  First of all, just as a logical matter, didn't she just say they gave out early warnings, Mr. Producer? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=527.0s)]
*  So how will cuts to the agency have anything to do with it? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=533.0s)]
*  Look, whoever is responsible, if anybody, it should be dealt with. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=538.0s)]
*  I suspect people per se are not that responsible for it. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=544.0s)]
*  I heard the lieutenant governor talking about a siren system they had thought about, but they didn't put in place. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=549.0s)]
*  Okay, they will look back on those things. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=553.0s)]
*  But cuts to the agency. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=555.0s)]
*  So, Betsy Klein, which cuts to the agency are you talking about? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=557.0s)]
*  Which cuts to the agency? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=562.0s)]
*  I mean, this is it. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=564.0s)]
*  We got Schumer here. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=566.0s)]
*  Reuters. Schumer once probed a National Weather Service response in Texas. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=568.0s)]
*  He asked a government watchdog to investigate whether cuts at the National Weather Service affected the forecasting agency's response to catastrophic and deadly flooding in central Texas. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=574.0s)]
*  He asked the Department of Commerce's Acting Inspector General to probe whether staffing vacancies at the National Weather Service, San Antonio, contributed to delays, gaps, or diminished accuracy. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=585.0s)]
*  So he's not interested in anything but trying to pin something like this on cuts. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=596.0s)]
*  Because you're not allowed to cut anything. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=603.0s)]
*  You're not allowed to reduce anything. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=605.0s)]
*  Period. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=608.0s)]
*  Okay, well over at Right Scoop, our friend Brian, New York Times blames disastrous flooding in Texas on Doge cuts, debunked. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=612.0s)]
*  And I have to sit here and deal with this. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=621.0s)]
*  I have to sit here and deal with this. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=623.0s)]
*  When people are mourning, when they don't even announce, well, they have the names of these people, it's horrendous what's taking place. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=625.0s)]
*  Sit here and deal with this. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=634.0s)]
*  The Associated Press of all entities destroyed the idea this was because of staffing. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=639.0s)]
*  They said the National Weather Service office in New Braunfels, which delivers forecasts for Austin, San Antonio, the surrounding areas, had extra staff on duty during the storm. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=644.0s)]
*  Extra staff on duty. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=655.0s)]
*  Where the office would typically have two forecasters on duty during clear weather, they had up to five on the staff. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=658.0s)]
*  There were extra people in here that night, and that's typical in every Weather Service office. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=664.0s)]
*  You staff up for an event and bring people in overtime and hold people over, said Runyon. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=669.0s)]
*  National Weather Service did its job with warnings at least 12 hours before the devastating floods, according to meteorologist Chris Martz on ex-Twitter. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=679.0s)]
*  He says, okay, let's talk some facts. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=689.0s)]
*  The Camp Mystic flood disaster in Texas is very unfortunate, and I hope all of the missing girls are found. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=692.0s)]
*  The usual suspects are exploiting this tragedy to score political brownie points. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=698.0s)]
*  Some left-wing activists are blaming this flood on climate change. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=703.0s)]
*  Yeah, like the host on CNN. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=707.0s)]
*  Others are blaming the deaths of missing persons on inadequate warning caused by low staffing at the National Weather Service, caused by Trump administration, federal reductions in force. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=711.0s)]
*  First of all, staff cuts played no part in this tragedy. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=720.0s)]
*  National Weather Service issued a flood watch for Kirk County more than 12 hours after the flood. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=724.0s)]
*  They also issued a flash flood warning for Hunt and Ingram three hours after the Guadalupe River began to climb. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=729.0s)]
*  There's plenty of lead time with respect to the forecast and issuance of warnings, writes this person. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=735.0s)]
*  The flood was caused by the remnants of Tropical Storm Barry becoming embedded in a broad mid-level trough over central Texas. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=741.0s)]
*  These remnant lows are typically slow moving, drop heavy rain over a large geographical area where the troposphere destabilizes. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=748.0s)]
*  This particular one-state quasi-fairly stationary caused massive flooding along the Guadalupe River, something that has happened many times before. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=756.0s)]
*  In 1987, flash flood on the same river killed 10 teenage campers from the Pot Oak Old Christian Camp with another 33 swept away, but they survived. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=766.0s)]
*  Why is it that this guy can find this out but CNN can't? Camp Mystic is built on a flood plain. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=779.0s)]
*  It is on sediment that has been deposited by hundreds if not thousands of floods over the last millennium. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=785.0s)]
*  The event has nothing to do with climate change. The tragedy had nothing to do with Doge cuts. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=790.0s)]
*  If you're someone who has exploited this catastrophe because you just don't like Trump, you need to take a serious look in the mirror. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=795.0s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=804.0s)]
*  It's meteorologist Chris Martz. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=807.0s)]
*  And so here we have a debate. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=813.0s)]
*  Prior to all the bodies being found and perhaps some survivors as well. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=816.0s)]
*  And of course, nothing, nothing escapes racism. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=823.0s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=831.0s)]
*  You have this woman, Sadie Perkins, ex-Houston appointee on TikTok this week. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=834.0s)]
*  Let me tell you something. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=839.0s)]
*  The Internet is breeding evil, breeding evil, and TikTok is the main culprit. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=842.0s)]
*  And I don't know what's happening with TikTok, but that damn thing needs to be sold now and it needs to be cleaned up. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=849.0s)]
*  And I don't want to hear about free speech and everything else. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=855.0s)]
*  It's a private company. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=858.0s)]
*  The company needs to clean it up because this is crazy between the communist Chinese and all the crap that people put on this stuff. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=860.0s)]
*  And honestly, X, that is Twitter, Facebook, they need to be cleaned up too. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=870.0s)]
*  I think people who call me kike over and over again on the Internet should be removed. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=877.0s)]
*  Don't you, Mr. Producer? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=882.0s)]
*  Or worse. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=884.0s)]
*  Or worse. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=887.0s)]
*  So here's this Sadie Perkins, cut 22, go. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=892.0s)]
*  I know I'm probably going to get canceled for this, but Camp Mystic is a whites only girls Christian camp. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=896.0s)]
*  They don't even have a token Asian. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=906.0s)]
*  They don't have a token black person. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=908.0s)]
*  It is a all white, white only conservative Christian camp. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=910.0s)]
*  If you ain't white, you ain't right. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=916.0s)]
*  You ain't getting in. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=918.0s)]
*  You ain't going. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=919.0s)]
*  Period. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=920.0s)]
*  And I think that context needs to be said in this matter. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=921.0s)]
*  It's not to say that we don't want the girls to be found with whatever girls that are missing or whatever right now. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=927.0s)]
*  But you best believe, especially in today's political climate, if this were a group of Hispanic girls, especially with them being in East Texas, it should be most likely Hispanic. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=933.0s)]
*  If this were a group of Hispanic girls out there, this would not be getting this type of coverage that they're getting. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=945.0s)]
*  Yes, it would. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=951.0s)]
*  It would be getting exactly the type of coverage it deserves and it would. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=953.0s)]
*  Who the hell do they think that's talking about? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=959.0s)]
*  All these women sold in the sex slavery. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=961.0s)]
*  Me. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=963.0s)]
*  Most of them are Hispanics. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=965.0s)]
*  You don't hear about it on the left wing sites, do you? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=970.0s)]
*  I'm just so sick of this. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=973.0s)]
*  I'm sick of thugs like this. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=975.0s)]
*  Sick of it. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=977.0s)]
*  Cut 23. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=979.0s)]
*  Go. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=981.0s)]
*  And y'all are over here just spewing all this hate on my page or whatever. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=983.0s)]
*  But baby, I give no f***. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=985.0s)]
*  Oh, shut up, you moron. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=987.0s)]
*  You're disgusting. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=991.0s)]
*  You're disgusting. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=993.0s)]
*  Don't give me this baby crap either. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=995.0s)]
*  Doesn't matter what race you are, you'll always be a lowlife. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=997.0s)]
*  I'll be right back. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=999.0s)]
*  Mud, blood, pen. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=1001.0s)]
*  Folks, the American flag is under attack. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=1007.0s)]
*  We saw it mocked and burned in L.A. during protests. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=1009.0s)]
*  And when people attack the American flag, aren't they attacking everything it stands for? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=1011.0s)]
*  The sacrifice of our troops, the values of our founding, the promise of liberty and justice for all. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=1015.0s)]
*  Thankfully, the American flag is still there. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=1019.0s)]
*  And the American flag is still there. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=1021.0s)]

*  If we lose the meaning of our flag, we risk losing our nation. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=1051.0s)]
*  That's why it's imperative that patriots just like you take advantage of the Heritage Foundation's new resource, Flags of Our Fathers. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=1055.0s)]

*  Even worse, we saw the Mexican flag and the Palestinian flag wave defiantly during [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=1139.16s)]
*  LA's violent riots. There's something seriously wrong with that picture. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=1143.32s)]

*  The leaflet referred to here, a last appeal to reason by Adolf Hitler, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=1410.6s)]

*  Number two, Hitler had already issued directive number 16 on July 16, formalizing plans for the [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=1445.4s)]
*  imminent invasion of Britain, Operation Selium. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=1451.48s)]

*  and Netherlands, and Luxembourg, and had begun in July 1940 to make plans to invade the Soviet Union, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=1459.24s)]

*  Nazi Germany started bombing London and other British cities in a campaign known as the Blitz. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=1481.1599999999999s)]
*  But this didn't happen because, to his great regret, Hitler's friendly little leaflet campaign [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=1486.1999999999998s)]
*  had failed. It happened because by that point, Hitler had realized that Nazi Germany was losing [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=1490.9199999999998s)]
*  the Battle of Britain, that the air superiority he needed prior to an invasion was going to elude [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=1495.72s)]

*  Their purpose was to turn the British against the war and leave Nazi Germany with a free hand to [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=1507.08s)]
*  do more of what it had done since 1937. As for the idea that Churchill magically had all the [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=1511.96s)]
*  leaflets collected, the Nazis dropped five million of them in literally every part of the country, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=1519.0s)]
*  so while efforts were indeed made in cities to clean up, and the British government indeed [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=1524.52s)]
*  didn't like it, hiding them all wasn't remotely feasible. It was even attempted in earnest. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=1528.84s)]
*  Even in the 1990s, when I was a kid, there were so many of them in circulation, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=1534.12s)]
*  you'd see them at garage sales and antique shops, and old people would get them from their [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=1538.9199999999998s)]
*  attics to show them off. To cast Hitler as Cooper does here, and by extension Churchill, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=1543.3999999999999s)]
*  you have to ignore that when this leaflet was dropped, Nazi Germany had taken over pretty [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=1549.3999999999999s)]
*  much all of Western Europe. It was in the process of attempting to destroy Britain's air defenses so [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=1553.56s)]
*  in Hitler's own words of July 16, Germany could quote, eliminate the English homeland as a base [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=1559.0s)]

*  It's not hard to tell. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2659.2s)]
*  When you went to school, you grew up with people like this. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2662.2s)]

*  There weren't so much debates as there were confrontations. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2708.2s)]
*  Individuals who have pled to crimes, who have committed crimes, who want you to follow them. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2716.2s)]
*  Individuals who have paid for hookers and done other things, who want you to follow them. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2722.2s)]
*  Individuals who have more personalities than Sybil, who want you to follow them. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2728.2s)]
*  Quizlings who can't decide on the most fundamental issues, whether they stand on this side of the fence or that side of the fence. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2733.2s)]

*  Because that's not you. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2753.2s)]
*  That's not what we Americans are. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2756.2s)]
*  We know right from wrong. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2759.2s)]

*  We know this is a great country. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2767.2s)]
*  We don't attack people because they're poor or billionaires. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2772.2s)]
*  We don't attack people if they're Jew or Gentile, if they're male or female. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2775.2s)]
*  It doesn't matter to you and me. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2783.2s)]
*  We could care less. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2785.2s)]
*  We take them as they come. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2788.2s)]
*  As long as they support the country, support our values and principles. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2792.2s)]
*  There can be debates within that context, but not debates about that context. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2797.2s)]
*  We've had great leaders. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2808.2s)]
*  We've had the worst of leaders. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2809.2s)]
*  And when the worst of leaders take us into certain words they shouldn't take us into, it doesn't mean we're bad people. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2814.2s)]
*  And it doesn't mean forever more. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2819.2s)]
*  We should avoid confrontation if confrontation is about saving the next generation and the generation after that. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2823.2s)]
*  We should use prudence. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2831.2s)]
*  We should use our knowledge, our common sense. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2834.2s)]
*  We shouldn't be ideological about war or foreign policy in any way. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2837.2s)]
*  I find that people of the sort I've just defined, they're not really in the substance. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2845.2s)]
*  When they say they want to debate people, they really don't want to debate people. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2854.2s)]
*  They just want to try and steamroller them and humiliate them. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2858.2s)]
*  I've seen it. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2862.2s)]
*  Draw attention to themselves. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2865.2s)]
*  That's what they do. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2869.2s)]
*  And with the advent of podcasting, the advent of social media and everything that that has spawned, [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2873.2s)]
*  you get a lot of good people you wouldn't normally have heard from. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2882.2s)]
*  But you get a lot of the rest too. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2886.2s)]
*  And so it means you've got to be discerning. And you are. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2890.2s)]
*  People will disappoint you. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2896.2s)]
*  Not because you disagree with them, but because they're disappointing. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2898.2s)]
*  Because that's who they are. You come to learn who they are over time. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2903.2s)]
*  I do three hours a day, five days a week. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2907.2s)]
*  I don't hide anything. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2911.2s)]
*  I've done it for over two decades. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2914.2s)]
*  You know me and you know where I stand. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2918.2s)]
*  I've written 11 books. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2922.2s)]
*  I know the most and deepest thoughts I have about subjects. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2925.2s)]
*  Because I lay them out. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2932.2s)]
*  I lay them out. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2935.2s)]
*  I will never intentionally mislead you. I certainly will never lie to you. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2942.2s)]
*  I will never say things to you for reasons of puffery. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2947.2s)]
*  I'll never pretend I'm doing something right if I do something wrong. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2952.2s)]
*  If I do something wrong, I will let you know and I will apologize for it. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2956.2s)]
*  It's important that you, the millions and millions of you, [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2963.2s)]
*  get to listen to whomever you want, watch whomever you want, [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2967.2s)]
*  that you're very discerning. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2972.2s)]
*  Because there's a lot out there now. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2975.2s)]
*  Some of it really great, some of it really horrible. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2978.2s)]
*  I'll be right back. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2984.2s)]
*  If you're with one of the big three wireless carriers, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2993.2s)]
*  you're really overpaying for your service, period. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2995.2s)]
*  You're paying for thousands of retail stores you never go into. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=2998.2s)]
*  You're paying for unnecessary perks you never use. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3001.2s)]
*  You're paying a massive premium for what you think is superior 5G service. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3004.2s)]
*  Guess what? PureTalk uses the same 5G network on the same 5G towers. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3009.2s)]
*  The only difference, they don't charge you for any of the garbage. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3014.2s)]
*  Instead, PureTalk gives you unlimited talk, text, plenty of data for just 25 bucks a month. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3017.2s)]
*  Folks, that's less than half the price of the big guys [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3023.2s)]
*  during a time when saving a buck really matters. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3026.2s)]
*  I am a PureTalk customer. I have been for years. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3029.2s)]
*  I made the switch. It's easy. You can even keep your phone and your number. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3032.2s)]
*  So do this. Go to puretalk.com slash Levin. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3036.2s)]
*  That's puretalk.com slash L-E-V-I-N. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3040.2s)]
*  And you'll save an additional 50% off your first month. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3043.2s)]
*  You can switch over to PureTalk in as little as 10 minutes. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3047.2s)]
*  That's puretalk.com slash Levin, L-E-V-I-N. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3051.2s)]
*  To switch to PureTalk, wireless by Americans for Americans. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3054.2s)]
*  You know, this bill that was passed by Congress... [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3063.2s)]
*  Has anybody read this thing? [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3068.2s)]
*  You know, I paged through it the other night, Mr. Producer. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3070.2s)]
*  It's a pretty good bill. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3073.2s)]
*  There's a lot of good things in this bill. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3076.2s)]
*  So I'm thinking to myself, is the perfect bill? Of course not. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3081.2s)]
*  Would we have liked to cut another 5%? Of course we would. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3085.2s)]
*  But, ladies and gentlemen, Congress is made up of people we elect, [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3088.2s)]
*  and the people we can't stand elect. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3092.2s)]
*  They don't have enough votes to cut anymore. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3096.2s)]
*  So what is President Trump supposed to do? [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3099.2s)]
*  What's he supposed to do? [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3102.2s)]
*  Now compare this bill to what the Democrats did for four years. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3104.2s)]
*  They ran the debt through the roof. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3107.2s)]
*  They're talking about the deficits of spending on this. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3109.2s)]
*  Depending on whose math you look at, [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3112.2s)]
*  it's either cutting $1.5 trillion or it's adding $4 trillion. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3116.2s)]
*  The problem with the adding $4 trillion crowd, the Congressional Budget Office, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3120.2s)]
*  is they don't factor in growth from tax cuts. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3124.2s)]
*  And they do this every time. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3128.2s)]
*  And so if you listen to them, you'll sink every tax cut forever. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3130.2s)]
*  Because they only count it as a cost, not as a growth potential. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3134.2s)]
*  Now we know it's a growth potential because we know it grows. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3138.2s)]
*  Whether it was Kennedy or Reagan or Trump 1 or Trump 2, it'll grow. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3141.2s)]
*  And so they're trying desperately, are the Democrats, [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3149.2s)]
*  to tell you that there are Medicaid cuts. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3152.2s)]
*  First of all, most of you aren't on Medicaid. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3155.2s)]
*  But those of you who are on Medicaid, you're on Medicaid because you need it. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3158.2s)]
*  Because that's the nature of the program. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3162.2s)]
*  It's for people who are destitute, people who are having hard times [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3165.2s)]
*  for a period of time, an extended period of time and so forth. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3168.2s)]
*  It is not for illegal aliens and it's not for able-bodied and able-mind young adults. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3171.2s)]
*  And unfortunately we have millions of people who are stealing from the program [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3177.2s)]
*  by violating the requirements. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3182.2s)]
*  They are to be removed, millions of them, and that will help save the Medicaid program. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3185.2s)]
*  For the Democrats, they're telling you they're slashing Medicaid [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3189.2s)]
*  and throwing all these people off of health care. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3192.2s)]
*  That's what they're calling Medicaid cuts. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3195.2s)]
*  But it's not Medicaid cuts. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3198.2s)]
*  It's cutting people who are not supposed to be there in the first place. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3201.2s)]
*  If you're not supposed to be on the program and you're removed, [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3206.2s)]
*  that's not a Medicaid cut. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3211.2s)]
*  That's removing somebody who's ripping off the system. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3213.2s)]
*  Don't we want them removing people off the system? [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3216.2s)]
*  I think we do. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3218.2s)]
*  Don't we want people who are 32 years old, able-bodied, able-mind, [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3220.2s)]
*  working at least 20 hours a week? Is that so hard? [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3224.2s)]
*  They even say you don't have to have that kind of job. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3228.2s)]
*  You can volunteer for something, maybe the dog pound or your church. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3230.2s)]
*  Is that so horrible when the federal government says you've got to do something [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3235.2s)]
*  for 20 hours a week if you're able-bodied and able-mind? [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3240.2s)]
*  If you're not able-bodied and able-mind, you're a legitimate recipient of Medicaid support. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3243.2s)]
*  So that's what the bill does. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3248.2s)]
*  Now, tax cut for billionaires. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3252.2s)]
*  I've asked over and over again, which tax cut in the bill is for billionaires? [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3254.2s)]
*  We've had all this discussion now, what, for weeks? [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3258.2s)]
*  Not a single media person has said what tax cut is for billionaires. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3261.2s)]
*  Not a single Democrat has said which tax cut is for billionaires. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3265.2s)]
*  There's no tax cut in there for billionaires. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3269.2s)]
*  Is it possible that billionaires benefit from a tax cut for people who earn $100,000 or $200,000 or $300,000? [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3272.2s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3278.2s)]
*  But that's not a tax cut for a billionaire. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3280.2s)]
*  For all our talk about worried about the average Joe and the average Sally, [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3287.2s)]
*  you saw what they did the last four years. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3291.2s)]
*  To gasoline prices, which are way down, to food prices, which are way down. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3295.2s)]
*  You saw what they did. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3300.2s)]
*  There's more job opportunities now than there's people seeking jobs. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3303.2s)]
*  That's a vibrant economy, and the tax cuts aren't even in place yet. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3307.2s)]
*  So I ask you, spends more than it should, Elon Musk says. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3317.2s)]
*  Okay, great. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3323.2s)]
*  I've said over and over again, I wrote a whole book on it. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3325.2s)]
*  Washington cannot, will not, reduce spending the way it needs to be reduced. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3328.2s)]
*  That's up to the state legislature's convention of states. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3333.2s)]
*  And so I ask, I left a post, a very polite post for Elon Musk, [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3336.2s)]
*  because America's governor, Ron DeSantis, triggered my thinking. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3340.2s)]
*  He said, of course, I think I triggered his thinking before. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3345.2s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3349.2s)]
*  It's the same mindset here. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3351.2s)]
*  Why don't you get behind some of these things that the convention of states is pushing? [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3353.2s)]
*  That's my view too. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3358.2s)]
*  Can you imagine what a magnificent push would be from the richest man on the face of the earth? [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3360.2s)]
*  Look what's been accomplished with minimal amount of money and minimal amount of attention. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3366.2s)]
*  A lot. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3371.2s)]
*  But the only way we're going to reconstitutionalize, a phrase I coined, but so be it, [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3373.2s)]
*  reconstitutionalize our society, is not through one spending bill. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3377.2s)]
*  It's not going to happen. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3382.2s)]
*  Congress is not going to fix Congress. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3384.2s)]
*  It institutionally is incapable of it now. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3387.2s)]
*  The state legislatures have to fix Congress. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3391.2s)]
*  And if they won't do it, it's not going to be fixed. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3396.2s)]
*  That's the truth. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3399.2s)]
*  But to hear the Democrats talk about spending and debt, ladies and gentlemen, [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3402.2s)]
*  that's like jacked the ripper out against the death penalty, you know? [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3409.2s)]
*  There's not a single policy that they support. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3415.2s)]
*  People are like, is there anything they do that you support? [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3418.2s)]
*  Not one damn thing. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3421.2s)]
*  Nothing. Zero. Nothing. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3423.2s)]
*  So this big beautiful bill, it's not positive for the economy, they say. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3426.2s)]
*  Yes, it is. It's very positive for the economy. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3432.2s)]
*  It's positive for millions and millions of youth. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3436.2s)]
*  I was having dinner the other night, more diner than anything else, [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3440.2s)]
*  and the waiter says to me, he's very excited. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3445.2s)]
*  I said, the cap is $25,000 on tips. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3448.2s)]
*  He says, that's far more than I'm making on tips. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3451.2s)]
*  I can't thank Trump enough. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3454.2s)]
*  If you're with one of the big three wireless carriers, [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3457.2s)]
*  you're really overpaying for your service, period. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3460.2s)]
*  You're paying for thousands of retail stores you never go into. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3462.2s)]
*  You're paying for unnecessary perks you never use. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3465.2s)]
*  You're paying a massive premium for what you think is superior 5G service. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3468.2s)]
*  Guess what? PureTalk uses the same 5G network on the same 5G towers. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3473.2s)]
*  The only difference, they don't charge you for any of the garbage. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3479.2s)]
*  Instead, PureTalk gives you unlimited talk, text, plenty of data for just $25 a month. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3482.2s)]
*  Folks, that's less than half the price of the big guys [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3488.2s)]
*  during a time when saving a buck really matters. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3491.2s)]
*  I am a PureTalk customer. I have been for years. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3493.2s)]
*  I made the switch. It's easy. You can even keep your phone and your number. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3496.2s)]

*  To switch to PureTalk, wireless by Americans for Americans. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3519.2s)]
*  The President of the United States and the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3526.2s)]
*  I can't see others as well as the Prime Minister of Israel and some of his folks. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3534.2s)]
*  The microphones are there at the dinner table. Go ahead. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3538.2s)]
*  And it was obliterated. It turned out the Atomic Energy Commission said it is obliterated. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3542.2s)]
*  I just want to take our hats off to those incredible flyers, [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3548.2s)]
*  the people that flew that big machine, and frankly, the mechanics and everybody else. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3553.2s)]
*  I mean, they had zero. They flew for 37 hours with zero problem mechanically. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3557.2s)]
*  I mean, when you think in carrying the biggest bombs ever, [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3564.2s)]
*  the biggest bombs that we've ever dropped on anybody, when you think, non-nuclear. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3568.2s)]
*  And we want to keep it non-nuclear, by the way. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3574.2s)]
*  But they did a phenomenal job. It was an amazing job. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3577.2s)]
*  I think that was, I was talking to Bibi about it before, [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3581.2s)]
*  that was the very beginning of the end. It ended very quickly after that. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3584.2s)]
*  I don't want to say what it reminded me of, but if you go back a long time ago, [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3588.2s)]
*  it reminded people of a certain other event. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3592.2s)]
*  And is Harry Truman's picture is now in the lobby in a nice location in the lobby where it should have been. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3596.2s)]
*  But that stopped a lot of fighting. And this stopped a lot of fighting. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3603.2s)]
*  When that happened, it was a whole different ballgame. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3607.2s)]
*  What might make you have the desire to do another strike on Iran? [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3610.2s)]
*  Another what? [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3616.2s)]
*  Another strike on Iran. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3617.2s)]
*  I hope we're not going to have to do that. I can't imagine wanting to do that. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3618.2s)]
*  I can't imagine them wanting to do it. They want to meet. They want to meet. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3623.2s)]
*  They want to work something out. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3626.2s)]
*  They're very different now than they were two weeks ago. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3628.2s)]
*  Is there a date yet for the Iran talks or a city? [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3632.2s)]
*  Do you know when and where the next round of Iran talks will be? [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3636.2s)]
*  Well, I can tell you I'd rather not say, but you'll be you'll be reading about it tomorrow or seeing it tomorrow. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3639.2s)]
*  Mr. President, what is the holdup currently in a ceasefire with Hamas? [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3645.2s)]
*  In which? [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3650.2s)]
*  In the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, what's currently the holdup? [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3651.2s)]
*  I don't think there is a holdup. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3655.2s)]
*  I don't think there's a holdup. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3658.2s)]
*  I think things are going along very well. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3660.2s)]
*  They just, you know, left each other and it was not a pleasant period of a few days. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3664.2s)]
*  It was a little longer than a few days, but this was not a pleasant period of time. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3669.2s)]
*  And, you know, we were at the end missiles were shot and every single missile was shot out of the air. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3674.2s)]
*  It was pretty amazing. That was sort of the end. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3682.2s)]
*  And they told us they were coming and where they were and what time they were coming. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3684.2s)]
*  And they said, if you'd like to have a different time, we'll do that. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3687.2s)]
*  And that's respect when they do that. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3690.2s)]
*  I appreciated that they did that. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3692.2s)]
*  There was no surprise. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3694.2s)]
*  We got the soldiers out of the base in Qatar in this case, but they knew they were coming. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3695.2s)]
*  Fourteen missiles were coming. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3701.2s)]
*  One o'clock, they said, would you like to make it later? [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3704.2s)]
*  I said, no, let them come at one o'clock. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3708.2s)]
*  And at one o'clock, everybody was, as you know, over 5,000 people left the base. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3710.2s)]
*  And we had three gunners and three assistants. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3716.2s)]
*  And out of the 14 that was shot, all 14 were knocked down. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3719.2s)]
*  And that was the end. That was about it. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3723.2s)]
*  And we had a rough time. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3725.2s)]
*  But sometimes, you know, sometimes you need the rough time in order to get I think things are going to be really settled down a lot in the Middle East. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3730.2s)]
*  And they respect us and they respect Israel. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3737.2s)]
*  They respect a lot of things that took place. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3740.2s)]
*  Nobody's ever seen equipment like what we sent over to knock out those sites. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3743.2s)]
*  But when those sites were knocked out, it essentially that was that was the end. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3749.2s)]
*  Do you think that there could be a two state solution that creates an independent? [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3753.2s)]
*  I don't know. I'd ask maybe that question. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3757.2s)]
*  You have the greatest man in the world to answer that age old question to state. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3759.2s)]
*  Go ahead. You give him your honest answer. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3764.2s)]
*  I think Palestinians should have all the power to govern themselves. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3767.2s)]
*  But none of the powers threaten us. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3771.2s)]
*  And that means that certain powers like overall security will always remain in our hands. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3773.2s)]
*  Now, that is a fact. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3779.2s)]
*  And no one in Israel will agree to anything else because we don't commit suicide. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3781.2s)]
*  We want life. We cherish life for ourselves, for our neighbors. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3787.2s)]
*  And I think we can work out a peace between us and the entire Middle East with President Trump's leadership. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3792.2s)]
*  And by working together, I think we can establish a very, very broad peace that will include all our neighbors. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3801.2s)]
*  Mr. President, first of all, Iran, you asserted that there's complete and total destruction of the nuclear facilities. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3809.2s)]
*  So what is the basis of the talks going forward? [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3816.2s)]
*  Is it to cap future nuclear activities, ballistic missiles, terrorist support, economic based opportunities? [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3819.2s)]
*  It's really a good question because if you remember when it was done, I sort of said, what's the purpose of talking? [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3826.2s)]
*  It's been knocked out and knocked out completely. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3831.2s)]
*  But they've requested a meeting and I'm going to go to a meeting and if we can put something down on paper, that will be fine. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3834.2s)]
*  That'll be good. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3840.2s)]
*  I think they've gained a lot of respect for us. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3842.2s)]
*  I think they've gained a lot of respect for Israel also. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3846.2s)]
*  But they would like to meet and we're going to have a meeting. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3849.2s)]
*  Steve, when is that meeting going to be? Do you want to say? [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3852.2s)]
*  Very quickly, very quickly, in the next week or so. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3855.2s)]
*  So we'll see what happens. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3860.2s)]
*  I think it would be nice to memorialize it, put it down. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3862.2s)]
*  But because of the incredible result of that attack, if you want to call it an attack, [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3865.2s)]
*  I didn't think it was necessary to have it in writing. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3875.2s)]
*  I think we spoke. I mean, that speaks much louder than writing. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3878.2s)]
*  But I can also understand why they'd want it. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3880.2s)]
*  And they've been very nice. They've been very respectful. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3883.2s)]
*  And it began by them telling us about 14. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3886.2s)]
*  They had to do you know what 14 represents, right? [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3889.2s)]
*  Do you know what 14 represents? [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3891.2s)]
*  Right? You know that, right? [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3893.2s)]
*  The number of bombs dropped. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3895.2s)]
*  So it was, you know, representative. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3897.2s)]
*  We got them all. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3900.2s)]
*  In your own. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3902.2s)]
*  Yeah, please. Behind you, please. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3903.2s)]
*  No, you. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3904.2s)]
*  So this is a question for the Prime Minister. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3906.2s)]
*  The likely next mayor of New York City, Zoram al-Malik, [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3908.2s)]
*  right, so the vocal critic of Israel, [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3911.2s)]
*  and of yourself, has said he would arrest you if you came to New York City, [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3914.2s)]
*  if he was mayor. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3919.2s)]
*  Is that something you take seriously, or are you concerned about that? [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3920.2s)]
*  Do you have a response to that? [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3923.2s)]
*  No, no, I'm not concerned about that. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3924.2s)]
*  I'll get it done. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3926.2s)]
*  Look, there's enough craziness in the world, but I guess it never ends. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3928.2s)]
*  I mean, you have this is falling. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3933.2s)]
*  And it's, you know, it's silly in many ways because it's just not serious. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3936.2s)]
*  But what is serious is the question I was asked before. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3942.2s)]
*  And after October 7th, people said the Palestinians out of state, [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3945.2s)]
*  Hamas state in Gaza, and look what they did with it. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3948.2s)]
*  They didn't build it up. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3950.2s)]
*  They built down into bunkers, into terror tunnels, [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3951.2s)]
*  after which they massacred our people, raped our women, [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3955.2s)]
*  beheaded our men, invaded our cities and our towns and our kibbutzim, [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3958.2s)]
*  and did horrendous, horrendous massacres, [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3965.2s)]
*  the kind of which we didn't see since World War II and the Nazis, the Holocaust. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3968.2s)]
*  So people aren't likely to say, let's just give them another state. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3972.2s)]
*  It'll be a platform to destroying Israel. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3976.2s)]
*  We'll work out a peace with our Palestinian neighbors, [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3978.2s)]
*  those who don't want to destroy us. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3982.2s)]
*  And we'll work out a peace in which our security, [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3985.2s)]
*  the sovereign power of security always remains in our hands. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3987.2s)]
*  Now, people will say it's not a complete state. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3991.2s)]
*  It's not a state. It's not that. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3993.2s)]
*  We don't care, you know. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3995.2s)]
*  We vow never again. Never again is now. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=3997.2s)]
*  It's not going to happen again. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4001.2s)]
*  So we'll see you in New York next year. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4002.2s)]
*  Oh, wow. Look, I'm going to come there with President Trump [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4004.2s)]
*  and we'll see what the... [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4008.2s)]
*  How do you know who the mayor will be? I don't know that. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4012.2s)]
*  Do we know that? [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4014.2s)]
*  He's going to be very fine. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4015.2s)]
*  We don't know who the mayor is going to be yet, but this is a communist. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4017.2s)]
*  He's not a socialist. He's a communist. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4021.2s)]
*  And he said some really bad things about Jewish people, [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4023.2s)]
*  and he said some really bad things about a lot of people. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4026.2s)]
*  I'm sticking with this. It's very important. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4028.2s)]
*  And I think he's going through a little bit of a honeymoon right now, [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4030.2s)]
*  but he might make it. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4033.2s)]
*  But, you know, it all comes through the White House. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4034.2s)]
*  He needs the money through the White House. He needs a lot. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4036.2s)]
*  He's going to behave. He'll behave. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4038.2s)]
*  He better behave, otherwise he's going to have big problems. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4040.2s)]
*  But it's a philosophy that this country is not ready for, and it never will be. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4042.2s)]
*  By the way, we have a man with us who thought this was going to be a very glamorous, easy job. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4047.2s)]
*  He's the ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, former governor, former everything. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4053.2s)]
*  I'd say he's a former everything and respected and loved by everybody. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4059.2s)]
*  And he loves Israel. He loves the state of Israel, and nobody loves it much more. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4064.2s)]
*  And he's not Jewish, and he loves Israel. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4070.2s)]
*  And he wanted to be there. I said, you know, Mike, it could be dangerous. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4073.2s)]
*  No, no, no. Well, at least I was right about that. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4075.2s)]
*  He was in every bunker you could be in. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4078.2s)]
*  He was running around from bunker to bunker, but he's still with us, fortunately, and he's done a great job. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4080.2s)]
*  Would you say a few words, Mike? [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4085.2s)]
*  I just want to say what an honor it is to serve you, Mr. President, [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4087.2s)]
*  and to see a historic horizon that we're looking at in the Middle East. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4090.2s)]
*  And when the President made his trip to the Middle East, [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4095.2s)]
*  and then he really reached out to the new Syrian government, [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4099.2s)]
*  knowing they needed a partner and knowing that they could pick the wrong partner, [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4104.2s)]
*  and what the President did, which took us all off guard, [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4108.2s)]
*  but the strategic move in that has set up something that is absolutely historic. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4113.2s)]
*  And, Mr. President, I don't even think you fully comprehend the impact that you're having on the region [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4120.2s)]
*  in a way that is so remarkable. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4127.2s)]
*  And it was your leadership, your foresight, you did that when the B-2s went in. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4131.2s)]
*  The celebration, the sense of partnership that you gave with the Israeli people was so dramatic, [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4139.2s)]
*  but the message was bigger than to Israel. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4147.2s)]
*  It was a message to the world. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4149.2s)]
*  America's friends can trust us, but America's foes had better fear us. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4151.2s)]
*  And that is a message that the President sent to everyone on the planet, [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4157.2s)]
*  and it is a message that will resonate toward a matter of peace, [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4162.2s)]
*  the likes of which I don't think we've ever seen. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4166.2s)]
*  So, thank you. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4168.2s)]
*  Great job you're doing, Jim. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4170.2s)]
*  They love you all, and they really respect them and they love them. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4171.2s)]
*  Mr. President, you know, it's very, very interesting. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4175.2s)]
*  We had the pilots here yesterday, as you know, and they were incredible. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4179.2s)]
*  And we also had the mechanics. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4184.2s)]
*  We had a lot of people here that had to do, I think about 170 people, [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4186.2s)]
*  that had to do with that incredible journey, a journey that could have been horrible. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4191.2s)]
*  I remember what happened with Jimmy Carter, with the helicopters, [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4196.2s)]
*  and all of the problems, and ultimately hostages. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4199.2s)]
*  We had the exact opposite. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4203.2s)]
*  Everything was perfect. It worked perfectly. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4204.2s)]
*  But I didn't realize, I was saying to one, [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4206.2s)]
*  is this something that you felt strongly about? [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4209.2s)]
*  Absolutely, sir. I couldn't wait. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4212.2s)]
*  I said, better you than me. But they couldn't wait. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4214.2s)]
*  He said, sir, we've been practicing for this mission for more than 20 years. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4218.2s)]
*  From just after 2000, they've been thinking and practicing to go into that area. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4223.2s)]
*  I guess you probably know that better than anybody, Pete. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4230.2s)]
*  Well, we're going to have to take a little break. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4233.2s)]
*  I am fascinated by this. Aren't you, Mr. Producer? [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4235.2s)]
*  Have you ever seen anything like this, America, or heard anything like this? [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4239.2s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4242.2s)]
*  You can see he's rightly, rightly, justifiably proud of his order to take out those nuclear sites. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4243.2s)]
*  This is what the fake man again never understood. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4250.2s)]
*  This man who understands prudence. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4252.2s)]
*  This man is very wise. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4256.2s)]
*  This man who knew what had to be done. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4257.2s)]
*  And now there's an opportunity for a wider peace [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4260.2s)]
*  rather than a ram with nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4263.2s)]
*  I want you to think about this when you hear from these people going on and on [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4266.2s)]
*  about who the real warmongers are. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4270.2s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4273.2s)]
*  If you're with one of the big three wireless carriers, you're really overpaying for your service, period. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4274.2s)]
*  You're paying for thousands of retail stores you never go into. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4279.2s)]
*  You're paying for unnecessary perks you never use. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4282.2s)]
*  You're paying a massive premium for what you think is superior 5G service. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4285.2s)]
*  Guess what? Pure Talk uses the same 5G network on the same 5G towers. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4290.2s)]
*  The only difference, they don't charge you for any of the garbage. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4297.2s)]
*  Instead, Pure Talk gives you unlimited talk, text, plenty of data for just 25 bucks a month. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4300.2s)]
*  Folks, that's less than half the price of the big guys during a time when saving a buck really matters. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4306.2s)]
*  I am a Pure Talk customer I have been for years. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4311.2s)]
*  I made the switch. It's easy. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4314.2s)]
*  You can even keep your phone and your number. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4316.2s)]
*  So, I'm going to be talking to you about the 5G network. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4318.2s)]
*  I'm going to be talking to you about the 5G network. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4321.2s)]
*  I'm going to be talking to you about the 5G network. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4324.2s)]
*  I'm going to be talking to you about the 5G network. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4327.2s)]
*  I'm going to be talking to you about the 5G network. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4330.2s)]
*  I'm going to be talking to you about the 5G network. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4333.2s)]
*  I'm going to be talking to you about the 5G network. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4336.2s)]
*  I'm going to be talking to you about the 5G network. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4339.2s)]
*  I'm going to be talking to you about the 5G network. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4342.2s)]
*  I'm going to be talking to you about the 5G network. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4345.2s)]
*  We're going right back to the dinner table with the President and the Prime Minister. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4348.2s)]
*  We're going right back to the dinner table with the President and the Prime Minister. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4352.2s)]
*  There's a lot to lose by going back to conflict. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4355.2s)]
*  And there's a lot to gain by moving towards peace. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4358.2s)]
*  And I think that opportunity has been opened by the President and by the changed security situation, [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4361.2s)]
*  which we brought about with the collapse of the outside regime. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4368.2s)]
*  Are there direct talks with the outside government? [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4372.2s)]
*  Now, let's suppose there were. Would I answer yes? No. Right? [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4375.2s)]
*  That's my duty to ask. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4379.2s)]
*  It's your duty to ask and my duty to ask you back. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4381.2s)]
*  You know, at the request of a lot of countries in the surrounding area of the Middle East, including Bibi, [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4384.2s)]
*  we took the sanctions off Syria. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4391.2s)]
*  And I met the new leader. I was very impressed by him. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4395.2s)]
*  Somebody said, well, he comes from a very tough background. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4399.2s)]
*  I said, well, you know, I'm not that surprised. It's a tough part of the world. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4402.2s)]
*  But I was very impressed by him. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4405.2s)]
*  But we took the sanctions off because we want to give them a chance. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4407.2s)]
*  They would never have had a chance without the sanctions. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4410.2s)]
*  And one of the things we have with Iran is, you know, we have very they call biting. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4413.2s)]
*  They are very biting sanctions. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4417.2s)]
*  And I would love to be able to at the right time, take those sanctions off, give them a chance at rebuilding, [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4419.2s)]
*  because I'd like to see Iran build itself back up in a peaceful manner and not going around saying death to America. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4426.2s)]
*  Death to the USA, death to Israel, as they were doing. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4431.2s)]
*  You know, they were the bully of the Middle East, and now they're not the bully anymore. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4435.2s)]
*  But they were saying terrible things and would like to see them. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4439.2s)]
*  They have such potential. You know, they have the oil power and they have great people, smart people, energetic people. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4442.2s)]
*  Amazing. And I know so many Iranians, Iranians from New York. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4449.2s)]
*  I have a lot of friends and they're great people. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4454.2s)]
*  So it's a shame when you see a thing like this happen. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4457.2s)]
*  But I think that taking the sanctions off of Syria is going to give Syria a great shot at making it. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4459.2s)]
*  Mr. President, I'm going to follow up on a congressional question. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4465.2s)]
*  Are there any executive orders that you'd like to see Congress focus on when they come back in session? [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4470.2s)]
*  Do you have any that you prioritize to go first? [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4475.2s)]
*  Well, we've done a lot of them in the last, as you know, and the I always say the great big beautiful bill. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4478.2s)]
*  I had the word great, but it was the largest bill of its kind ever passed. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4484.2s)]
*  We were talking about it before. It was a beauty. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4489.2s)]
*  But, you know, a lot of the things that we did, executive orders have been codified in the legislation that we just had passed. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4493.2s)]
*  And we're going to be sending it a lot more over the next period of about two months separately. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4501.2s)]
*  But a lot of it has was part of that big, beautiful big bill. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4506.2s)]
*  Mr. President, on tariffs, what happened to 90 trade deals in 90 days? [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4511.2s)]
*  Oh, we've spoken to everybody. We know every it's all done. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4517.2s)]
*  I told you I told you we'll make some deals. But for the most part, we're going to send a letter. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4522.2s)]
*  We're going to say welcome to the United States if you'd like to participate in the greatest, most successful country ever. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4527.2s)]
*  I mean, we're doing better than ever. We have I don't think you're going to see these numbers. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4534.2s)]
*  We've never had numbers like this. We've never had investment like this. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4540.2s)]
*  We have more than 90. We're going to have much more than 90. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4543.2s)]
*  But most of those are going to be sent to letter. This is exactly what I said. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4546.2s)]
*  Now we've made a deal with United Kingdom. We've made a deal with China. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4549.2s)]
*  We've made a deal. We're close to making a deal with India. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4554.2s)]
*  Others we met with and we don't think we're going to be able to make a deal. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4557.2s)]
*  So we just send them a letter. If you want to if you want to play ball, you have to. This is what you have to pay. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4560.2s)]
*  So we're as far as I'm concerned, we're done with sending out letters to various countries telling them how much tariffs they have to pay. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4565.2s)]
*  Some will maybe adjust a little bit depending if they have a cause. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4573.2s)]
*  We're not going to be unfair about it. And actually, it's a small fraction. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4578.2s)]
*  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we have a big hour left. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4582.2s)]
*  I don't know if they'll still be added at that table if they are. I'm going to keep listening with you. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4585.2s)]
*  This is history. But you're listening to his history. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4591.2s)]
*  We've never had a president like this. And see how sharp he is and wise he is. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4594.2s)]
*  He talks through all these issues. He can feel any question. We'll be right back. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4600.2s)]
*  He's here. He's here. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4608.2s)]
*  Now broadcasting from the underground command post. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4612.2s)]
*  Deep in the bowels of a hidden bunker somewhere under the brick and steel of a non-descript building, we've once again made contact with our leader, Mark Levin. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4615.2s)]
*  Hello America, Mark Levin here. Our number 877-381-3811, 877-381-3811. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4630.2s)]
*  Well, it looks like we have federal judges who are, I don't know, can we call them criminal? [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4639.2s)]
*  Their conduct is certainly violative of the Constitution. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4651.2s)]
*  Listen to this latest one. Federal judge blocks Planned Parenthood defunding in Big Beautiful Bill. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4657.2s)]
*  This is from Just the News. US District Judge Indira Tawani, an Obama appointee, issued the temporary restraining order. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4664.2s)]
*  She's in Boston. The ruling comes in the wake of a Supreme Court ruling that dramatically limited the scope of nationwide injunctions by lower court judges and is sure to lead to a legal fight with the administration. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4675.2s)]
*  Now this isn't the first one. This is like the third federal judge who's defied the Supreme Court's ruling, which upholds the Constitution, separation of powers. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4688.2s)]
*  And remember, these lower federal courts, they're created by Congress and their jurisdiction is created by Congress. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4697.2s)]
*  Congress defunded Planned Parenthood in the bill that the president signed. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4705.2s)]
*  Congress defunded it. The president signed it. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4713.2s)]
*  So there's two branches of government, the elected branches, the one that's in charge of the power of the purse, the one that's required to execute the law. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4718.2s)]
*  And then in comes a federal judge appointed by Obama that says, sorry, you have to fund Planned Parenthood? [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4726.2s)]
*  Now, ladies and gentlemen, there is literally nothing that compels this. Nothing. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4734.2s)]
*  The true design of the defund provision is simply to express disapproval of, attack, and punish Planned Parenthood, writes the judge, which plays a particularly prominent role in the public debate over abortion. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4743.2s)]
*  Excuse me, that's what Planned Parenthood argued. Who cares what they argued? [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4756.2s)]
*  Who cares what their position is? Congress doesn't have to fund Planned Parenthood and the president doesn't have to sign on to it. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4762.2s)]
*  I mean, this is ridiculous. Now, as bad as that group is, and remember, it was started by Margaret Sanger, who was a eugenicist, [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4768.2s)]
*  who was very popular among the Ku Klux Klan in the South, not just the South, the New Jersey, as a matter of fact. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4778.2s)]
*  I wrote all about her and the Democrat Party hates America. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4785.2s)]
*  But the point is, where does a federal judge get power to say, no, Congress and the president, you shall fund this group or that group. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4790.2s)]
*  So this will be reversed. But the problem is this is more of the same tactics by a million, a million knives here. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4798.2s)]
*  Appointed by Obama. Pretty grotesque, don't you think? Again, her name is Indira Talwani, T-A-L-W-A-N-I, an Obama appointee. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4808.2s)]
*  And of course, what did Obama and Biden do when it came to appointees? The most radical kooks they could find, including [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4821.2s)]
*  They run these different foundations and organizations and law professors and all the rest. And that's what they've done. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4829.2s)]
*  And again, she's not the only one. But according to her, she's compelled, excuse me, Congress and the president are compelled, [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4838.2s)]
*  compelled to fund Planned Parenthood. That's pretty sickening. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4846.2s)]
*  I don't know how many people in this audience are really worked up about this sort of the Seppstein stuff. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4856.2s)]
*  Apparently there is no list to make available, as I understand it. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4865.2s)]
*  The FBI director, Cash Patel, the deputy director, Dan Bondi, you know, the attorney general said, look, we investigated everything and this is the way it is. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4874.2s)]
*  Some are calling for Pam Bondi's head. Some are saying that Cash and Dan have sold out. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4883.2s)]
*  Let me just slow down here a little bit. I'm sure people are very upset, some, about all this. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4890.2s)]
*  I've known Dan Bongino for a long, long time, as have you, Rich. He's not one to duck any of this stuff, is he? [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4900.2s)]
*  If they had the goods, they'd present them. He's the deputy director of the FBI. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4909.2s)]
*  I know Cash Patel less well, but Cash Patel has never been afraid to take anything on. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4914.2s)]
*  Why would he be afraid to take this on? And moreover, why would they deep-sex it if they had the information? [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4920.2s)]
*  Pam Bondi, I know her somewhat. I respect her. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4929.2s)]
*  She was one of the attorneys who was involved in litigating 2020. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4936.2s)]
*  She's not one to duck from any controversy or duck something like this either. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4940.2s)]
*  So I'm not going to trash them, nor am I going to undermine them. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4947.2s)]
*  And so, having worked at that Department of Justice, it's a big damn place. There's a lot of responsibilities. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4954.2s)]
*  But I would also point out to you that sometimes things just don't work out the way we want them to work out. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4962.2s)]
*  Now, what about Bondi saying she's going through the list now and so forth and so on? [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4971.2s)]
*  Well, she'll have to explain that. My guess is she was talking about, as Caroline Levitt said, [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4975.2s)]
*  the pile of information she had to go through, not necessarily a specific list of individuals. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4982.2s)]
*  But she would have no reason to deep-sex it either. None of them would. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4988.2s)]
*  That's where I'm coming from. You get to know people over time. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=4995.2s)]
*  She's a stand-up lady. Patel's a stand-up guy. Bongino's a stand-up guy. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5003.2s)]
*  And so if all three of them and others who we trust, and the President of the United States who put out a true social statement, [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5010.2s)]
*  they can clear his great faith in them and they've done a fantastic job, [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5018.2s)]
*  I'm here on the outskirts like everybody else, so I'm supposed to do what? Yell at them? [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5023.2s)]
*  So I'm not going to do that. I'll let others do it. I'm not going to do it because I don't get it. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5031.2s)]
*  In other words, so what? What if I do yell at them? And I'd feel very bad about it. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5039.2s)]
*  Again, these are people that we all know. We all know these people. I don't mean personally. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5045.2s)]
*  We all know these people and who they are, and they're not going to do a cover-up. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5050.2s)]
*  I can't even think why would they do a cover-up, Mr. Producer? It makes no sense, right? [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5054.2s)]
*  If they had a list of all these Epstein clients and so forth, why would they cover it up? [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5060.2s)]
*  And by the way, how would you cover it up? [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5066.2s)]
*  In other words, that information is available to scores and scores of people at the FBI and the Department of Justice. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5070.2s)]
*  Something would leak. Nothing's leaked. There hasn't been a leak. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5076.2s)]
*  And that place leaks like a sieve. Take it from somebody who was chief of staff over there. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5085.2s)]
*  They're not all allies over there. In fact, I'd say 80% of them are not. Maybe worse. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5090.2s)]
*  So if this stuff's being looked at by the FBI, it's being looked at by the criminal divisions, [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5096.2s)]
*  it's being looked at by other divisions, and then it goes up to the attorney general, [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5101.2s)]
*  through the deputy attorney general and so forth, it goes through a lot of hands. A lot of hands. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5107.2s)]
*  And I suspect if they had some list of all the clients and all of this and that, they'd want to get it out. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5112.2s)]
*  Why wouldn't they? [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5119.2s)]
*  I know the left-wing media is having a blast with all this. I know that. People are upset. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5122.2s)]
*  I see Alex Jones is having a nervous breakdown. He always looks like he is. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5128.2s)]
*  Not that he is. Don't get me wrong. That's just the way he looks. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5134.2s)]
*  I saw a piece in the blaze there, Mr. Producer, that was quoting Alex Jones yesterday. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5140.2s)]
*  Was it the day before? About turtles or something? I couldn't remember what it was, but fascinating. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5146.2s)]
*  So no, I'm not jumping on the bandwagon. Of course, the media is saying all the influencers are attacked. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5153.2s)]
*  No, all the influencers are not. Some people are. Some people are not. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5162.2s)]
*  Be very skeptical of these entities like the Drudge Report or Mediocre Eye. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5169.2s)]
*  They want nothing but fights. They want nothing but National Enquirer type headlines. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5176.2s)]
*  They want nothing but clicks. They grift, and that's what they want. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5181.2s)]
*  They don't actually do any news. They don't actually report anything. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5185.2s)]
*  They just give their opinions and they change headlines and they move words around. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5191.2s)]
*  That's all. And the more controversial they can be, the more they can stir the pot, [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5197.2s)]
*  the more preposterous their headlines, the more money they make. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5203.2s)]
*  So they're not a news organization. They're a profit-making entity. That's what they are. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5208.2s)]
*  Profit-making entity. I'll be right back. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5215.2s)]
*  So an ICE officer was shot in the neck and the assailant was killed as a result. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5228.2s)]
*  We have ICE officers. We have Border Patrol officers. They're being attacked now openly. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5244.2s)]
*  Remember the scene in Newark where they're actually attacked by members of Congress? [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5250.2s)]
*  You saw what took place in Los Angeles. How the Democrats circle the wagons around the protesters [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5255.2s)]
*  and the violent rioters. Attacked President Trump for bringing in reinforcements. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5261.2s)]
*  The Democrat Party is extraordinarily violent in America. They are. They're very, very violent. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5268.2s)]
*  Their militia are violent. The Marxist Islamists are part of their militia. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5274.2s)]
*  The illegal aliens are part of their militia. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5280.2s)]
*  I haven't heard many leading Democrats speak out this evening about what took place, [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5283.2s)]
*  about that ICE officer being almost murdered. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5289.2s)]
*  Have you heard that, Mr. Bridget? I haven't even seen any of that. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5294.2s)]
*  They don't care. It's just like all these people dying from this flood and there they are. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5299.2s)]
*  National Weather Service, when in fact the National Weather Service had people there in overtime [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5305.2s)]
*  more than they normally have. They don't care. All the women sold into sex slavery on the open border. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5311.2s)]
*  They don't care. 325,000 unaccompanied minors missing. They don't care. They just don't. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5317.2s)]
*  They just don't give a damn. It's horrendous. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5327.2s)]
*  And it's their propaganda. It's what they say. Same with their media. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5336.2s)]
*  What they call these people, what they call conservatives, what they call the President. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5341.2s)]
*  I mean, assassination attempts on the President of the United States, they still haven't started using the same exact rhetoric. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5347.2s)]
*  Propaganda. Hakeem Jeffries, he's out there. Thousands of people are going to die. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5352.2s)]
*  Tens of thousands are going to die because of this bill. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5358.2s)]
*  It's sick. This guy, Scott Bascenti, Treasury Secretary, this guy is a cool cucumber. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5365.2s)]
*  I mean, this guy is, he's pretty good on his feet. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5372.2s)]
*  And here he is on CNBC today. Cut 9, Mr. Producer, go. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5377.2s)]
*  Look, we inherited a mess. And I'm not sure where all these deficit hawks were when the team Biden was blowing out the deficit. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5382.2s)]
*  So last year was 6.7 percent of GDP, which was the highest it had been when we weren't in a recession, weren't at war. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5390.2s)]
*  And as your previous guest said, we don't have a tax collection problem. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5398.2s)]
*  We have a spending problem and we're trying to get that under control. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5405.2s)]
*  We are also trying to accelerate growth because changing the growth trajectory upward solves a lot of the deficit problems. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5410.2s)]
*  Mm hmm. In other words, we're going to grow the economy. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5420.2s)]
*  Now, that hasn't been done since Trump 45 and before him since Reagan. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5424.2s)]
*  And growing the economy is very important. It creates prosperity, creates even more jobs, even better jobs. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5431.2s)]
*  And Washington doesn't work that way. Washington grows Washington. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5437.2s)]
*  And so they're always going to attack that this creates a debt. Any any. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5443.2s)]
*  And it may create some debt. But we've already talked about this. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5447.2s)]
*  You know, Rand Paul and Tom Massey can beat their chess all they want. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5452.2s)]
*  All these other guys about how we need to cut spending. But they're not. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5455.2s)]
*  And they can't. And they won't. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5460.2s)]
*  You and I are for Convention of States. We've been talking about this for years now. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5465.2s)]
*  I wrote a book about it. Our buddy Mark Meckler and his wonderful white patty. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5469.2s)]
*  And they lead a movement of over five million activists. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5474.2s)]
*  Being done in the states, one state at a time. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5479.2s)]
*  And that's how it's going to be done. I wrote a book called the Liberty Amendment. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5484.2s)]
*  Many of you bought it. My suggestion for amendments. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5489.2s)]
*  If I have a slight little disagreement with my with America's governor, balanced budget, amendment and term limits. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5493.2s)]
*  That's OK. I'm not opposed to that, depending on how you balance the budget. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5501.2s)]
*  But I much prefer the Melter Freeman approach, which is limiting the growth of government to the percentage of the GDP. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5504.2s)]
*  And also to provide term limits. I have no problem with I think that's a smart idea. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5515.2s)]
*  And you do need to amend the Constitution to get it. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5521.2s)]
*  But there are also other things that are very, very important in terms of regulations, in terms of the size of government, [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5524.2s)]
*  in terms of who gets to decide what. So it's a little more involved than a balanced budget amendment per se. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5530.2s)]
*  So I would that quibble a little bit with that position. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5538.2s)]
*  And not only that, the Convention of States movement, that entire movement, [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5544.2s)]
*  the state resolutions incorporate the proposals that were developed by the states within the states [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5550.2s)]
*  that are consistent, pretty much one state to the next. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5557.2s)]
*  So you can't really have one state off saying, well, I want to do these two things. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5561.2s)]
*  The whole notion is that you have a Convention of States based on issues that the states agree to bring as a collective. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5565.2s)]
*  That these states are coming saying, OK, we're going to have a Convention of States. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5576.2s)]
*  These are the issues we're going to discuss these issues. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5580.2s)]
*  And I really like what Convention of States has done. It's very, very important. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5583.2s)]
*  But these guys who are beating their chests and patting themselves on the back about how they're warriors for limiting spending, [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5588.2s)]
*  if they're not active in the Convention of States movement, they're really nothing other than speech-givers. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5594.2s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5600.2s)]
*  This is where Hollywood liberals come for rehab. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5604.2s)]
*  The Mark Levin Show is back at 877-381-3811. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5609.2s)]
*  Please don't forget, if you can help donate some money and help these folks in Texas, it's all in the social sites there. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5616.2s)]
*  Just hit the link, do whatever you can, $5, $500, whatever it is. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5624.2s)]
*  It's tax deductible, of course. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5630.2s)]
*  And people are really working so hard to try and save anybody who might be left and to recover others. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5632.2s)]
*  Somebody's little girl or little boys in there, somebody's family. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5640.2s)]
*  It's just horrendous, absolutely horrendous. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5646.2s)]
*  And a prayer always helps. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5653.2s)]
*  It helps. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5658.2s)]
*  It helps you, too. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5659.2s)]
*  It helps you, too. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5660.2s)]
*  Let's jump into the gene pool, shall we? [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5662.2s)]
*  Yes, we can. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5664.2s)]
*  Let's go to Susan, Upstate New York on the Mark Levin app. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5666.2s)]
*  Susan, how are you? [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5670.2s)]
*  I am hanging in there thanks to being able to listen to you to keep my head on straight. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5672.2s)]
*  Well, thank you there, young lady. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5677.2s)]
*  Listen, I talked to you a few weeks ago when you first announced that you were going to be on an advisory committee. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5680.2s)]
*  Yes. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5689.2s)]
*  For President Trump. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5690.2s)]
*  And I don't know if you remember this, but I said, well, I'm going to sleep better knowing that you're going to be like part of that. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5691.2s)]
*  Yeah, but I hate to tell you this. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5698.2s)]
*  I wasn't at the first meeting because it was held during the course of this program. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5700.2s)]
*  So I told them, you guys got to pick a different time and day and then I'll show up. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5703.2s)]
*  And I will. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5708.2s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5710.2s)]
*  Your absence was already in there because I have been sleeping better over these few weeks. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5711.2s)]
*  But I really wanted to ask you about something that is very concerning to me. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5720.2s)]
*  And I've been very involved like you have been about school choice. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5726.2s)]
*  We want to get these children rescued from these failing public schools. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5731.2s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder that I heard and read that there were things in this big, beautiful bill that were going to be extend or promote and actually implement these policies. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5736.2s)]
*  Do you have any feedback? [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5753.2s)]
*  Because I know you're like the guru. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5755.2s)]
*  No, I need to dig into this more. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5757.2s)]
*  My understanding is a general matter is it expands school choice to cover more and more families. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5759.2s)]
*  And I want to take a look at that too, because it's a very great point. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5765.2s)]
*  And we look, to be honest with you, school choices for the families, the kids. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5769.2s)]
*  But really, we need to break the back of these teachers union. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5773.2s)]
*  They're teaching our kids crap. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5775.2s)]
*  They're teaching our kids to hate their own country. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5777.2s)]
*  A lot of these school districts don't even do the Pledge of Allegiance anymore. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5780.2s)]
*  The Pledge of Allegiance is what allegiance to your own country. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5783.2s)]
*  I mean, is that so horrible? [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5786.2s)]
*  And so we got to get these classrooms back. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5788.2s)]
*  School choice is a is a very, very powerful tool to help the kids to help the parents get out of these lousy schools wherever they may be. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5790.2s)]
*  But also to enable some reforms in these government run schools. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5799.2s)]
*  If that's even possible, I don't even know because these unions like I have an iron fist. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5805.2s)]
*  All right, Susan, thank you for your call. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5811.2s)]
*  We always appreciate it. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5813.2s)]
*  Let's keep going. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5815.2s)]
*  Lake Tahoe, California, XM satellite. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5816.2s)]
*  Mark, how are you, sir? [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5818.2s)]
*  I'm good, Mark. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5820.2s)]
*  It's an honor to talk to you about your book, by the way. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5821.2s)]

*  I always learn a lot from you. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5826.2s)]
*  I thought I knew everything, but I don't. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5828.2s)]
*  And you teach me that I want to. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5830.2s)]
*  I don't know everything either. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5832.2s)]
*  That's why I write books so I can learn more. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5833.2s)]
*  Anyway, go right ahead. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5836.2s)]
*  The philosopher that said that what you don't know is a leap towards, you know, anyway, I was poor. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5837.2s)]
*  You are juggling a lot of balls tonight, and I commend you for that with the Middle East and Trump. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5844.2s)]
*  And but I want to say that forgive me. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5852.2s)]
*  I have a subscription in The New York Times and today's editorial was just an absolute attack on the big, beautiful bill. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5857.2s)]
*  And my point is that your introduction tonight in informing America about what that bill means in terms of the cuts and so forth, [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5868.2s)]
*  pushing back against the unrelenting 24-7 nonstop fear margarine from the Democrats amplified by the mainstream media is a very important thing, Mark. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5881.2s)]
*  And you have that voice and you need to continue and I'm in complete support. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5893.2s)]
*  So keep it up, bro. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5898.2s)]
*  You're the man. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5900.2s)]
*  You're you're terrific. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5901.2s)]
*  Thank you. We're going to keep going through it. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5903.2s)]
*  I page I went through it. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5904.2s)]
*  I didn't read it, but I did page through it quickly and marked it. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5905.2s)]
*  And Mike, my printer doesn't print 900 copies. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5910.2s)]
*  I actually had to go to Office Depot to print the damn thing. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5914.2s)]
*  You believe that? [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5916.2s)]
*  So so I do little things like that from time to time if my buddies aren't around to help me. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5917.2s)]
*  So that's what I did and page through it. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5923.2s)]
*  And you can't find a tax cut for billionaires in there. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5926.2s)]
*  It doesn't exist. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5929.2s)]
*  You can't find people legitimately on Medicaid being cut from Medicaid. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5931.2s)]
*  It doesn't exist. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5936.2s)]
*  And I went through these sections and I'm looking at how are these people liars? [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5938.2s)]
*  They're just liars. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5942.2s)]
*  And of course, the media go along with it. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5943.2s)]
*  They don't challenge them. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5945.2s)]
*  Tell us what provision of the bill provides tax cuts for billionaires. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5946.2s)]
*  Which one is it? [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5950.2s)]
*  How hard is it to ask that question, Mark? [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5951.2s)]
*  He's gone. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5956.2s)]
*  Well, good guy. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5957.2s)]
*  We appreciate your buddy. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5958.2s)]
*  James Northville, Michigan, on the Mark Levin app. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5959.2s)]
*  How are you? [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5963.2s)]
*  Hi, Mark. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5964.2s)]
*  Thank you for taking my call. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5965.2s)]
*  And thank your call screener. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5967.2s)]
*  I've been listening to you. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5968.2s)]
*  Thank you. Call screeners. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5969.2s)]
*  Oh, thank you, man. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5971.2s)]
*  I appreciate that. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5972.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5974.2s)]
*  You know, I was listening to you earlier and I listened to this judge on this ruling with Planned Parenthood. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5975.2s)]
*  And I was fuming. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5980.2s)]
*  I'm like, what is going on here? [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5982.2s)]
*  You've got the Supreme Court that just ruled that South Carolina does not have to fund Medicaid through their state with Planned Parenthood. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5984.2s)]
*  And you've got a bill that was just passed by our elected president and Congress. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5993.2s)]
*  And these judges still think that they can go ahead and do whatever they want and circumvent the rules. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=5998.2s)]
*  Mark, you know what my theory is here? [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6004.2s)]
*  I think they are looking for a reason. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6006.2s)]
*  They are looking for something for Donald Trump to ignore the ruling. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6008.2s)]
*  And that'll be their reasoning for impeachment on this guy in twenty. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6012.2s)]
*  Well, they're going to try and impeach him anyway. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6016.2s)]
*  They won't need a reason. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6018.2s)]
*  And by the way, I'm glad you brought that up because I don't think people are taking these midterm elections, even though they're far off seriously enough. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6020.2s)]
*  I keep hearing my brothers and sisters, colleagues in this business and on TV go on about, well, the Democrats, they're killing themselves. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6027.2s)]
*  They're destroying the. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6034.2s)]
*  Let me tell you something. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6035.2s)]
*  They're going to fight like hell to win those midterm elections. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6037.2s)]
*  The illegal aliens, vast majority of them are still here. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6040.2s)]
*  That's why their judges are trying to block them because they get congressional districts based on the counting of them. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6043.2s)]
*  I know it's wrong. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6048.2s)]
*  You don't have to convince me. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6049.2s)]
*  I've been saying it for decades, but that's the way it works right now. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6050.2s)]
*  Why can't some Trump change it because he has to go through the courts again and they're trying to change it. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6054.2s)]
*  That said, that's why that border was wide open for one reason, one reason open. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6059.2s)]
*  Others have now repeated it, but that border was wide open to change the congressional districts and to get these people to vote. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6065.2s)]
*  But you can change the congressional districts because they count people in the districts, not citizens. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6071.2s)]
*  And so that's how they intend to take the House of Representatives. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6077.2s)]
*  Just keep in mind all the barriers that are in place to prevent fraud and stuff like this are being destroyed. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6082.2s)]
*  They're being destroyed while they talk about every election is a legitimate election. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6087.2s)]
*  They don't actually believe that they try and change the election procedures in order to win the election. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6093.2s)]
*  So this midterm election, you talk about impeachment, it's crucially important or Donald Trump is going to they're going to be at it again. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6098.2s)]
*  These are nasty, evil people. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6105.2s)]
*  These are nasty, evil people. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6109.2s)]
*  Go ahead. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6111.2s)]
*  Friends and people I know and people I work with, Mark, we are madder than hell. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6113.2s)]
*  I talk to a lot of people and we are going to fight and we're going to keep going. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6117.2s)]
*  And I am trying to convince as many young people as I talk to about what they're doing. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6122.2s)]
*  They asked me, how do you know so much about this? [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6126.2s)]
*  I said, listen to the great one. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6129.2s)]
*  Listen to Mark. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6130.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6131.2s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, yeah. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6132.2s)]
*  Getting a lot of nice calls tonight. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6133.2s)]
*  I don't know what happened. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6135.2s)]
*  Thank you, buddy. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6136.2s)]
*  You're very, very kind. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6137.2s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6138.2s)]
*  It's slipping another one here. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6139.2s)]
*  Let's go to Diane in Brooklyn, New York, the great W.A.B.C. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6142.2s)]
*  How are you? [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6148.2s)]
*  Yeah, I originally called up because this this person was talking to me today who is, you know, definitely not for Trump. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6149.2s)]
*  And I have always been even before he ran, you know, he was like my daughter. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6160.2s)]
*  She was too. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6167.2s)]
*  He was talking to Jacob Javits one time about something else. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6168.2s)]
*  And I remember listening to him and thinking, wow, he would make an amazing president. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6173.2s)]
*  This was years before he did. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6177.2s)]
*  But anyway, she was telling me that because I said, Mom's down. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6180.2s)]
*  He's a Marxist. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6185.2s)]
*  And he wants to raise the minimum wage to thirty dollars. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6187.2s)]
*  He said, well, Trump said he's going to raise it to twenty five. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6191.2s)]
*  No, he didn't believe that he said that. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6195.2s)]
*  I don't remember him saying that at all. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6198.2s)]
*  What did he say that? [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6201.2s)]
*  That just makes that just makes people lose their job. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6202.2s)]
*  I didn't hear him say it. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6205.2s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6206.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6208.2s)]
*  Well, that's what she said. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6209.2s)]
*  And of course, now here's the problem. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6211.2s)]
*  Trump can't raise the minimum wage. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6213.2s)]
*  He has to have Congress approve it. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6215.2s)]
*  So that's number one. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6216.2s)]
*  It's not happening, nor should it. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6218.2s)]
*  Number two, a mayor can. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6219.2s)]
*  They can say jobs in this city. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6222.2s)]
*  You're going to pay so and so minimum wage. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6225.2s)]
*  So this guy, you know, he says there shouldn't be billionaires. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6227.2s)]
*  You hear him say that? [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6230.2s)]
*  There's not going to be billionaires in New York. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6232.2s)]
*  They're all going to move to Florida. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6234.2s)]
*  He says, well, tax the billionaires. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6236.2s)]
*  No, you won't, because they won't be there. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6237.2s)]
*  And that's the problem. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6239.2s)]
*  And it's not just that they're billionaires leaving. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6240.2s)]
*  They take their businesses with them. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6242.2s)]
*  They take their production with them. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6244.2s)]
*  They take their services with them. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6246.2s)]
*  They take their employees with them. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6248.2s)]
*  They take the whole tax base with them. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6249.2s)]
*  Yeah, people get this idea that you got a billionaire who's sitting in his basement [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6251.2s)]
*  and he's got a zillion mattresses filled with cash. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6255.2s)]
*  That's not what a billionaire is. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6258.2s)]
*  That's not how you become a billionaire. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6259.2s)]
*  That money has to keep moving. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6261.2s)]
*  It's got to keep shaking. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6263.2s)]
*  It's got to resonate throughout the economy. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6264.2s)]
*  You got to make profit. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6266.2s)]
*  How do you make profit? [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6267.2s)]
*  Capital investment, research and development, entrepreneurship. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6268.2s)]
*  That money keeps moving and moving and moving. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6273.2s)]
*  It's better to have billionaires than a central government with trillions and trillions of dollars. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6275.2s)]
*  I can tell you that. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6280.2s)]
*  All right, my friend, thank you for your call. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6281.2s)]
*  I don't remember Trump ever saying that, but it's not going to happen. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6284.2s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6287.2s)]
*  Mark Levin. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6288.2s)]
*  Let's take one more call so we can slip her in here. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6302.2s)]
*  Let us go to Dick Dayton, Ohio, XM satellite. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6305.2s)]
*  How are you, sir? [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6309.2s)]
*  Mark, you're great. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6311.2s)]
*  I just wanted to tell you I love your show and I tell your producer, [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6313.2s)]
*  what I see in Ohio is our governor has to be voted out because of these property taxes [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6317.2s)]
*  and this building of the stadium in Cleveland. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6324.2s)]
*  You still have that Rhino governor there. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6327.2s)]
*  The hell is his name? [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6330.2s)]
*  I can't remember his name. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6331.2s)]
*  Mike DeWine from Cedarville. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6333.2s)]
*  DeWine was a congressman. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6336.2s)]
*  He was a senator. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6338.2s)]
*  He was lieutenant governor. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6339.2s)]
*  He was attorney general. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6340.2s)]
*  Then he's governor. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6341.2s)]
*  This guy's never worked in the private sector. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6342.2s)]
*  No, no. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6344.2s)]
*  And you were talking about what I thought too. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6346.2s)]
*  You know, the wisdom and the entrepreneurship, we've got to get this stuff back. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6348.2s)]
*  An American dream to me. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6354.2s)]
*  I love this Fourth of July because I believe in the founding fathers. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6357.2s)]
*  I believe in democracy and the American dream will always stand with me, Mark. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6362.2s)]
*  And I got a couple of your books. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6367.2s)]
*  I've done them for social studies, but you are a great American, Mark. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6369.2s)]
*  You're very, very kind. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6373.2s)]
*  Thank you, brother. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6375.2s)]
*  You take care. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6376.2s)]
*  Tomorrow I'm going to be announcing the two other book signings, the two other locations, [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6377.2s)]
*  Reagan Library, the I think it's sold out altogether. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6381.2s)]
*  I mean, if you're trying to get in the standing in the oversold area, I don't think they call it that. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6384.2s)]
*  I'm calling it that. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6389.2s)]
*  You might want to try, but I don't know that there's anything left. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6390.2s)]
*  But give it a shot. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6393.2s)]
*  People drop here and there. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6395.2s)]
*  You might slip in. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6397.2s)]
*  It's going to be tough, but give it a shot. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6399.2s)]
*  But I'm going to be announcing a book signing in Reston, Virginia and a book signing in Ridgewood, New Jersey. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6401.2s)]
*  Now, in Ridgewood, you can figure that out, but I won't be mentioning that. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6409.2s)]
*  We're going to have a wonderful time. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6413.2s)]
*  In fact, the first signing I do will be in Ridgewood. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6415.2s)]
*  The second signing I do will be in Reston, Virginia. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6418.2s)]
*  The third one will be at the Reagan Library. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6421.2s)]
*  And but the goal here is to get this book in people's hands. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6423.2s)]
*  So if you can go to Amazon.com, I want to strongly encourage you to grab your copy. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6427.2s)]
*  People are starting to read it now. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6432.2s)]
*  Those who've been sent these they're called galley editions. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6435.2s)]
*  They're not the formal book, but the formal book I will have in my hand soon. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6441.2s)]
*  And I will start to give some of those out. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6445.2s)]
*  But I can't release it till the 29th of July. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6448.2s)]
*  But we're only three weeks away now. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6451.2s)]
*  So it's right around the corner. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6453.2s)]
*  You want to grab your copy. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6454.2s)]
*  I want to encourage you to do it now. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6455.2s)]
*  I really think you're going to enjoy this book. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6457.2s)]
*  I think you're going to learn a hell of a lot from this book. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6459.2s)]
*  And I want to get it into your hands if possible. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6464.2s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, we salute our armed forces, police officers, firefighters, emergency personnel, our truckers. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6466.2s)]
*  Thank all of you folks who are helping these poor people in Texas for God's sakes. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6472.2s)]
*  And I want to thank all of you. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6477.2s)]
*  I want to let you know how much I appreciate you. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6480.2s)]
*  I know I'm blessed to be here with you. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6482.2s)]
*  And let's do this again tomorrow. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6484.2s)]
*  See you then. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUw5yJBdHo&t=6486.2s)]
