Video Description: On Tuesday’s Mark Levin Show, no, Mark did not lobby President Trump on Iran policy, despite what the fake news is saying. The President knows Mark’s stance on Iran, which aligns with Trump and MAGA – prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Outlets like Politico are spreading false narratives and propaganda, particularly from isolationists and Iranian sympathizers. Mark is not leading a lobbying campaign of "GOP hawks."  The problem is Iran, not those warning about Iran. Also, a federal judge ruled against a lawsuit filed by California’s AG and Governor Newsom, affirming Trump’s authority to deploy the National Guard without state approval. Democrat leaders failing to address the L.A. riots are politically motivated, aiming to secure voter bases through open borders, birthright citizenship, and chain migration.  Later, the Democrat party exercises negative power. Negative power is a coercive force that suppresses individual identity, sovereignty, and liberty. Used by authoritarian entities like communist or fascist regimes, it aims to dominate society rather than serve it, eroding free will, self-worth, and aspirations.  Finally, the Democrat Party seeks permanent power and control, rather than just winning elections. Their strategies, such as maintaining open borders, opposing deportations, and criticizing ICE, are designed to build a loyal constituency, particularly through future voters and their children under birthright citizenship. Democrats tolerate waste, fraud, and abuse in programs and contracts as long as these benefit their allies and solidify their power base.

# Trump, National Guard, and the Battle for Law and Order
**The Mark Levin Show:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE)
*  Ladies and gentlemen, this next segment of the podcast is brought to you by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=0.0s)]
*  For over 50 years, the Great Heritage Foundation has been America's outpost in Washington, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4.8s)]
*  fighting against the D.C. federal bureaucracy and working to secure a future that allows Americans [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=9.52s)]
*  to live the good life. For too long, common sense principles have been ignored by many of the very [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=14.64s)]
*  leaders claiming to fight for America, but the Heritage Foundation is proud to hold our leaders [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=19.28s)]
*  accountable and stand up for America's founding principles, paid for by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=23.6s)]
*  He's here. Now, broadcasting from the underground command post, deep in the bowels of a hidden [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=30.48s)]
*  bunker, somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=38.0s)]
*  we once again make contact with our leader, Mark LeVein. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  Hello America, Mark LeVein here, our number 877-381-3811, 877-381-3811. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=120.0s)]
*  Last evening we spent two and a half out of three hours on what's going on in L.A. and the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=132.8s)]
*  rest of the country with the insurrectionists, so we're going to spend a lot of time on it [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=136.88s)]
*  this evening as well. But before I do, so I called the President of the United States [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=140.96s)]
*  earlier this morning, which I don't often do. He and I are very close friends. I know this upsets [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=148.32s)]
*  the isolationists and the fifth columnists and their media mouthpieces and propagandists. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=156.88s)]
*  I said, Mr. President, have I lobbied you about Iran? He said, no. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=163.68s)]
*  I said, Mr. President, when we met last week, did I lobby you about Iran? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=173.12s)]
*  He said, no. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=179.28s)]
*  I said, Mr. President, did I ask to meet with you or did you ask to meet with me last week? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=182.4s)]
*  He said, I asked to meet with you. He said, why? I said, because we have a group of people [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=188.48s)]
*  who are pushing propaganda, who are pushing a narrative into Politico, into other places. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=196.79999999999998s)]
*  And that suggests the opposite. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=203.52s)]
*  Well, Mark, why don't you ignore them? Ignore them, because you and I both know it's not true. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=208.96s)]
*  It's very important that you folks understand. I'm going to continue. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=219.52s)]
*  I'm not going to get into what I discussed with a president who wants to meet with me. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=223.60000000000002s)]
*  There were a number of subjects that came up. As far as Iran goes, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=228.48000000000002s)]
*  the president knows exactly where I stand on Iran. And he told me he knows exactly where I stand on [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=234.8s)]
*  Iran, because he watches my shows on Fox on Saturday and Sunday. The whole world knows where [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=241.12s)]
*  I stand on Iran. The Fifth Columnists, the isolationists know where I stand on Iran. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=249.84s)]
*  I suspect the Islamonazis in Tehran know where I stand on Iran. So why is that a secret? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=256.96s)]
*  What I am not doing and what I would not do to Donald Trump is lead a lobbying campaign of hawks, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=264.48s)]
*  as it was put in Politico. War hawks. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=272.88s)]
*  I'm not leading any lobbying campaign. I haven't organized any lobbying campaign, but it doesn't [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=276.71999999999997s)]
*  matter. So somebody and some group, a cabal, are putting out these leaks to entities like Politico. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=281.91999999999996s)]
*  Politico is untrustworthy. They took $8 million in subscriptions last year, 2024, from the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=291.76s)]
*  taxpayers, through the government and so forth. But I can tell you they're liars. I can tell you [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=298.4s)]
*  that the main writer of this piece, Rachel Bade, is a liar. That Rachel Bade is a propagandist. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=304.32000000000005s)]
*  That Rachel Bade is a scribe for the isolationists, for the Iranian special pleaders. And let me tell [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=312.96000000000004s)]
*  you something, America. These Iranian special pleaders like Chatsworth, Howard Spurr, Jr., [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  and others, they're making it, in my view, very difficult to get a deal with Iran. Because Iran, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=328.0s)]
*  apparently, from what the president said yesterday, is more arrogant, more in your face than they've [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=339.44s)]
*  been before. Because they watch our media. They watch the Chatsworths. They watch the others. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=345.6s)]
*  Some of the people in the White House who are undermining the president of the United States, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=352.96s)]
*  they see it and they hear it. And so they think that is a majority position of the United States [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=358.47999999999996s)]
*  when it is a tiny minority position of these reprobates and malcontents and miscreants. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=365.03999999999996s)]
*  Now, it's not a complicated issue. Under no circumstances should Iran get a nuclear weapon. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=373.59999999999997s)]
*  That's the Trump position, the MAGA position, the Reaganite position, the Rhino position, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=380.96s)]
*  the position of everybody who has two brain cells to rub together. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=386.4s)]
*  The debate is over whether you can trust an Islamic terrorist regime that has already [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=392.23999999999995s)]
*  lied its way through multiple administrations, that has signed numerous documents with the UN, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=398.24s)]
*  with Europe, with anybody they want. And yet here we are at the eleventh hour. And then we're told [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=403.84s)]
*  it's not the eleventh hour. There's some question about the intelligence says [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=410.0s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard. But Tulsi Gabbard is the only one. The IAEA says we're on the precipice. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=415.92s)]
*  The Austrian intelligence says we're on the precipice. Our own head [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=425.28s)]
*  of, I'm trying to find it, Central Command says they're on the precipice that they can [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=433.36s)]
*  have nuclear material in one week if they sprint to it. He just testified to that today. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=439.6s)]
*  The Israelis say they're on the precipice and they have the most to lose if there is in fact [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=446.0s)]
*  a military campaign. So, but Politico says there's some kind of question about this. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=450.15999999999997s)]
*  Now, I know who's leaking. There was a big article in the New York Times a couple of years ago about [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=462.32s)]
*  Chasworth Osborne Jr. He's been in Washington his entire life. He's worked the system his entire life. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=468.16s)]
*  He's got all kinds of media at the Washington Post, at Politico and everything, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=476.56s)]
*  rails against the left, but he uses the left and they use him. I don't have any of these contacts. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=480.64000000000004s)]
*  I don't talk to any of these people. If I put him into a lie detector test right now and asked him [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=486.48s)]
*  one media outlet to the other, he'd flunk if he lied. So that's the difference. I tell you the [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=492.24s)]
*  truth. I'm not working through any media. I'm not undermining the president. I'm not lobbying the [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=500.72s)]
*  president. I give my opinion if I'm asked and of course I'm paid to give my opinion here and on TV [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=507.28000000000003s)]
*  and on Blaze. It's that simple. My views are almost almost completely in line with the president's. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=513.12s)]
*  Almost. I'm not changing his views. I'm not making his views. I don't treat him that way. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=524.16s)]
*  Now, I know who the leakers are. Just a matter of time. In remarks at a Monday Business Roundtable, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=534.0799999999999s)]
*  President Trump made clear that the Iranian proposals thus far were unacceptable. Quote, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=541.04s)]
*  they're asking for things you can't do, Trump said. They don't want to give up, but they have [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=545.68s)]
*  to give up. They seek enrichment. We can't have enrichment. We want just the opposite. And so far [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=550.16s)]
*  they're not there. None of this appeared in the Politico piece. None of it. I didn't say this. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=555.8399999999999s)]
*  I didn't urge the president to say it. He said it. He said it. All the leaking to Axios and the [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=561.92s)]
*  leaking to Politico and the leaking to... It's the isolationists who are doing it. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=569.6s)]
*  It's them. They're doing it. They're trying to undermine the president. And what they're [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=576.4s)]
*  actually doing, America, is they're making his job a thousand times more difficult. For the reasons [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=581.2s)]
*  I said, the Islamo-Nazi regime in Tehran watches them, listens to them. Here's what they're saying. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=587.6s)]
*  And they say, oh, wow, this influencer, he has no problem with it. This person in the administration, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=593.76s)]
*  they have no problem with it. And so they are emboldened. They're emboldened. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=600.16s)]
*  So last week, I'm not going to tell you everything that was discussed. I had a meeting with the [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=610.8s)]
*  president at his request. It's leaked to the media. And then they put a spin on it. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=614.56s)]
*  Levine is lobbying Trump on the war. He asked my opinion. I gave my opinion. It's the same opinion [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=621.92s)]
*  I've given to you day in and day out. Same opinion I've given on Fox day in and day out. Same opinion [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=628.16s)]
*  I've given on Blaze day in and day out. And there's no surprise by anybody for anything. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=634.4s)]
*  I'm not lobbying for anybody. I'm not lobbying for a group of people. And yet this is what these [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=639.52s)]
*  dishonest reprobates want you to believe. Why? Because they're desperate. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=645.44s)]
*  They're the ones who have ties to Qatar. They're the ones who have ties to Putin. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=652.8800000000001s)]
*  They're the ones who have ties to all these bizarre, evil regimes. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=656.5600000000001s)]
*  They're the ones who are mouthpieces, the special pleaders for the enemy, not me. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=663.12s)]
*  I was raised properly. I know who the good guys are and the bad guys are. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=669.12s)]
*  I'm not a former Democrat who's now in the administration [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=675.7600000000001s)]
*  attacking in her own way the brave men who had to drop atomic bombs on Japan [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=682.4000000000001s)]
*  to end what could have been a forever war or where we might have lost up to a million soldiers. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=691.84s)]
*  This is sick. Sick in my humble opinion. I'm not a hawk. I'm a realist. A realist. Farm policy is [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=697.84s)]
*  about prudence. It's not about hawks and doves. It's not about ideology. This is what Rachel Bade [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=712.32s)]
*  is literally too stupid to understand. I've written about it in Liberty and Tyranny. I've [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=719.12s)]
*  explained it over and over on this program. She doesn't know me. She doesn't listen to this show. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=724.16s)]
*  She doesn't watch Fox. No, she's planted. This information is planted to her by Chatsworth and [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=729.36s)]
*  the others and she runs with it. She also works for ABC News. So she works for two media organizations [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=737.28s)]
*  that have serious questions of credibility. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=747.68s)]
*  An influential group of GOP hawks has launched a behind the scenes lobbying offensive pressing [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=750.0s)]
*  President Donald Trump not only to back off his administration's quest for a nuclear deal with Iran [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=758.48s)]
*  but green light an attack on Tehran by Israel. When did I do that? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=764.96s)]
*  A lobbying offensive. An influential group of GOP hawks. Who am I working with? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=769.52s)]
*  The campaign is raising alarms among Trump and his allies. Among Trump and his allies, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=777.36s)]
*  did they even talk to the President? He would have laughed at them. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=784.64s)]
*  By the way, at the end of the call, the president was not even talking to the president. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=789.8399999999999s)]
*  At the end of the call, he invited my wife and me to have dinner at the White House in the next [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=797.2s)]

*  House last Wednesday, conservative talk show host Mark Levin told Trump that Iran was days [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=826.88s)]

*  Mr. Producer? An argument Trump's own intelligence team has told the president is not accurate. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=838.56s)]
*  Yet his military advisors apparently are telling them it is accurate. And so is his CIA. So who [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=845.2s)]
*  are these intelligence advisors? We know who. According to an intelligence official, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=851.12s)]
*  I counted five anonymous sources in her article. Not one of them would go on the record. Not one [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=857.28s)]
*  of them had the courage to go on the record. Not a damn one. So here's Rachel Bade, a fraud, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=863.04s)]
*  a liar who goes with five anonymous sources, lies about me and my relationship with the president, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=870.08s)]
*  and the whole story is about how the Warhawks are lobbying the president. And we're not. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=878.4s)]
*  Certainly I'm not. And then the isolationist, she doesn't call them isolationists. She doesn't call [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=884.16s)]
*  them any any pejoratives, nothing. It's all one way, the five anonymous sources. And she goes on. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=891.76s)]
*  On a separate front, MAGA loyalists have been warily eyeing Rupert Murdoch's papers, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=900.5600000000001s)]
*  particularly the New York Post. Ah, see, this is the giveaway, Chatsworth, whatever. The hate for [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=908.24s)]
*  Fox. The vid won't take your crap. He doesn't like bullies. More than happy to engage with you. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=915.36s)]
*  They're trying to push the president to make a decision that's not what he wants. A senior [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=925.52s)]
*  administration official told Politico off the record, of course, that's one of two people, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=929.6s)]
*  and they know I know who they are. This person like the others in the story was granted anonymity to [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=936.4s)]
*  speak freely. Wow. Amazing. And to spread their lies. That's why they spoke anonymously. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=942.4s)]
*  So Rachel Bade, we tried to get her on this program to discuss her story. We asked her [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=952.64s)]
*  twice, didn't you, Mr. Badoozer? And she ignored you. She ignored you. She does commentary for [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=959.36s)]
*  ABC News. She's the Washington writer for Politico. But she ignored Mr. Badoozer. I wanted to have her [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=967.6s)]
*  on here. I wanted to challenge her. I wanted to challenge her on the anonymous sources. I wanted [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=974.16s)]
*  to challenge her on the lobbying. I wanted to challenge her on what happened in the meeting. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=978.72s)]
*  But she's a coward like they all are. She's a fraud. Rachel Bade, B-A-D-E. Now you're on my radar [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=983.12s)]
*  screen. I'll be right back. American sent President Trump back to Washington with a mandate to solve [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=991.6s)]
*  the border crisis, reverse the effects of Biden's inflation and restore American greatness. But at [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1004.64s)]
*  every turn, judges are blocking President Trump's attempts to fulfill this mandate. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1009.84s)]

*  what's going on. The White House knows what's going on. Little media types like Politico and [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1114.88s)]
*  maybe The Daily Caller, which was founded by Chatsworth and who knows? Oh, The Intelligent. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1122.3999999999999s)]
*  Where the hell is that one? That was the Independent. You know, if I were Politico, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1130.9599999999998s)]
*  I'd sue the Independent because I'd say about 80% of Isabel Keen's piece was plagiarized from [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1134.48s)]
*  Politico. She goes further that I'm lobbying Trump with misinformation. What a bunch of jackasses. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1140.48s)]
*  I'll be right back. Folks, are you concerned about the growing number of judges blocking [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1148.4s)]

*  A judge, just so you know, just ruled a federal district judge [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1219.76s)]
*  in this bogus lawsuit that was brought by the Attorney General of California on behalf of the [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1224.0s)]
*  Governor of California. Two true pathetic buffoons. That yes, he can bring in the National Guard. I [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1228.64s)]
*  mean, ladies and gentlemen, we have experience with this over the decades with other presidents. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1237.0400000000002s)]
*  They don't have to be called in by the governor. We had a few southern states that wouldn't allow [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1241.1200000000001s)]
*  black kids to go to school with white kids. And presidents have either sent in the [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1251.44s)]
*  active infantry or they have federalized the National Guard. That's simple. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1259.52s)]
*  And we went through some of the statutory language last night. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1267.2s)]
*  So the president clearly has this authority. And it is amazing to me [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1272.16s)]
*  that the governor and the Attorney General of California, two radical kooks, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1276.72s)]
*  two failed, particularly the governor, two failed, hugely failed politicians. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1281.52s)]
*  They say the president's not upholding the law, which he is. Well, they won't uphold the law. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1287.2s)]
*  Well, they won't uphold the law. Now, it's obvious why the Democrats don't want to put down riots [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1295.44s)]
*  by illegal aliens, because that's their constituency. It's obvious why they don't want to put down riots [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1301.1200000000001s)]
*  on college campuses by Islamists, because that's their constituency. It's obvious why they don't [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1306.8000000000002s)]

*  borders have been open. There's no... Even the New York Times was talking about illegal immigration [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1326.96s)]

*  But they've said it about cops. They've said it about cops. They've said it about Supreme Court [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1405.12s)]
*  justices that they don't like. And then when you push back, it's, oh, you're attacking the court [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1412.48s)]

*  Now they lie about that. No, they didn't. I mean, they were under attack and they were [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1501.44s)]
*  calling for the National Guard. We know who called for what? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1505.52s)]

*  Jayapal out there giving speeches, defending the illegal alien. You see, it's just like the [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1518.24s)]

*  the media is defending them. They hear them trashing Donald Trump or Secretary Hegseth [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1546.56s)]

*  throw bricks and cinder blocks because they hear that there's one political party and 90% [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1566.16s)]
*  of the media that stand behind them. That's what they hear. And unfortunately, they're right. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1572.56s)]
*  And once again, we see what's taking place. So once again, like in 2020, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1584.96s)]
*  they tell us it's mostly peaceful. They tell us that, you know, Joe Biden is [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1589.04s)]
*  Einstein. Same media, same tricks, same lies. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1595.36s)]
*  Hat tip, gravy and cut one go. The L.A. County police say that they have it under control. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1601.84s)]
*  Carrying a flag is not illegal, as you know. What did happen in 1992 was so different from what [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1609.12s)]
*  we're seeing now. I mean, that was that was a a real a real riot. Video after video has shown [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1616.32s)]
*  that these agents are the ones provoking protesters and also making up, you know, [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1623.52s)]
*  aggression by these protesters that later video shows people were not aggressive. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1631.04s)]
*  We are having an administration that's targeting peaceful protests, people that are there to protest. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1636.0s)]
*  The president is saying the National Guard because he doesn't like the scenes. He doesn't [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1641.52s)]
*  like the scenes of people peacefully protesting. The unrest is isolated. L.A. is home to millions [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1645.36s)]
*  of people, most of whom are having a normal day here on Sunday. You know, you've heard reports [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1650.7199999999998s)]
*  that there are riots on the streets of Los Angeles. That is not what's happening across [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1655.36s)]
*  the city of Los Angeles. Governor Newsom's right. There was anything like a riot happening on Friday, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1658.8799999999999s)]
*  Saturday. We just witnessed a protester thanking a national guardsman for his service here in [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1663.52s)]
*  California. LAPD, by most estimates, had this under control last night. No, I don't think the [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1669.36s)]
*  National Guard is is needed now. Things in L.A. are calm. There was a protest that got a little [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1676.24s)]
*  unruly late at night. There's been no violence where anybody that was protesting hit anybody, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1682.0s)]
*  shot anybody, threatened anybody. Nothing happened. What is just a bunch of people having fun watching [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1689.6799999999998s)]
*  cars burn. Most of those demonstrations were very peaceful. They were chanting. They were shouting. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1697.12s)]
*  People were driving by honking their horns. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1702.3999999999999s)]
*  Just the the systemic lying, lying, systemic lying and deceit is just incredible. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1706.6399999999999s)]
*  Once again, we see what took place. We hear what took place through the media. The media deny the [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1716.08s)]
*  media. The media deny what they what they're providing us with. Now, these people are giving [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1722.88s)]
*  their opinions. But they're liars. They're absolute liars. President Trump deserves [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1728.4s)]
*  three cheers. He deserves a pat on the back for what he did here and what he's going to continue [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1738.72s)]
*  to do. And he made it abundantly clear. We're going to put it down no matter what it takes, [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1742.72s)]
*  no matter where it occurs. That's a leader. That's a leader. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1746.88s)]
*  Here's Trump in the White House today. Cut to go. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1755.5200000000002s)]
*  Mr. President, when is the last time you spoke with Governor Newsom? [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1758.96s)]
*  A day ago. Called him up to tell him got to do a better job. He's doing a bad job, [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1765.2800000000002s)]
*  causing a lot of death and a lot of a lot of potential death. If we didn't send out the [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1771.44s)]
*  National Guard and last time we gave a little additional help, you would have Los Angeles would [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1776.88s)]
*  be burning right now. Los Angeles would be not a lot different than what you saw take place in [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1782.88s)]
*  California and Los Angeles just a little while ago. And you know, you got to remember we have [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1789.52s)]
*  the Olympics coming and we don't want people looking at Los Angeles like it was like it would [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1794.56s)]
*  have been. It would have been bad. Last night they had total control. We didn't have the military in [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1799.76s)]
*  there, the National Guard, and then we also sent in some Marines. We had some bad people. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1805.36s)]
*  We have people they look in your face and they spit right in your face. They're animals. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1810.8799999999999s)]
*  And these are paid insurrectionists. These are paid troublemakers. They're agitators. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1814.96s)]
*  They're paid. Do you think somebody walks up to a curb and starts hammering pieces out, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1820.08s)]
*  has all the equipment necessary and starts handing it out to people to use as a weapon. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1826.16s)]
*  These are paid insurrectionists or agitators or troublemakers. You can call it whatever you want. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1832.4s)]
*  And we ended it and we have in custody some very bad people, some very bad people. And you know, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1838.96s)]
*  every now and then you get a kernel of truth from these liars like the the mayor of LA or the [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1847.2s)]
*  governor of California. She said that there was some kind of network at work that, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1853.68s)]
*  and I'm paraphrasing the flip of a switch, they just show up and they appear and it's obvious. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1861.3600000000001s)]
*  And that they're coming in from even out of the state as fast as they can because this is what [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1866.48s)]
*  goes on in this country now. We have a lot of dark money that funds these operations, a lot of dark [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1872.72s)]
*  money that's funding what takes place on our college campuses that we've talked about a great [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1878.64s)]
*  length here. A lot of it. The fact that the police chief said they were overwhelmed, their numbers [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1883.6000000000001s)]
*  were too big. And so you see everything would be fine if the feds would just stay out of it. If [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1889.8400000000001s)]
*  ICE wouldn't go in there and pull out the illegal alien criminals who need to be deported, if Trump [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1894.96s)]
*  would just let local, you know, I'm so sick of this. These cities in these states, especially [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1900.8000000000002s)]
*  the blue cities in blue states, they come to the federal government, they always want subsidies, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1907.44s)]
*  much more money than anybody else. When they have natural disasters, you and I are to pay for it. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1911.52s)]
*  But when something like this happens, they say, leave us alone, we'll handle it. Well, you know [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1917.2s)]
*  what? That's pretty much what happened in 2020. And it was a disaster. And it caught on in every [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1921.2s)]
*  major city in every blue state in the country. And who pays for most of this? All of us, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1925.68s)]
*  the citizens of the United States, not just the citizens of a city or a state. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1932.08s)]
*  This is our country. When we go to war, when we go to war, we fight for the country, we don't [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1939.1999999999998s)]
*  fight for a city or a state. When we secure our border, we're trying to secure our country, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1946.1599999999999s)]
*  not a particular city or state. It is the United States of America, there is federalism, of course. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1952.8799999999999s)]
*  And if local cops and state police can handle a situation, then the federal government doesn't [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1960.56s)]
*  get involved. In fact, 99.999% of the time it doesn't. But here, it was obvious. Now, [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1967.1999999999998s)]
*  you either have a leader who sees it and pulls the trigger and takes care of it, or you don't. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1974.6399999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden didn't. He didn't. Newsom did not. The mayor did not. Now, I love this DA who goes [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1979.12s)]
*  around and he says, you know, the vast majority of the people in LA were not there. The vast [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1987.28s)]
*  majority of people who were protesting were doing it peacefully. Then there was a small group within [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1991.84s)]
*  the protesters. Ladies and gentlemen, you never have a majority of the people riding in a city [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=1996.16s)]
*  or a country, or you cease to have a city or a country. It's always a small band. Some of the [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2006.0s)]
*  small bands are bigger than others, but it's always a fraction of the community. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2012.24s)]
*  But let me give you an example. When you have revolutions around the world, [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2019.76s)]
*  when you look at the communist revolution, when you look at Lenin's revolution, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2023.44s)]
*  when you look at these various revolutions that take place around the world, the vast majority of [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2028.64s)]
*  them are a minority part of the population. Because most other people are minding their [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2034.16s)]
*  own business. They just want to live. They just want to be left alone. They just want to be able [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2040.4s)]
*  to be with their families and so forth. So they're not involved in revolutionary activity. On the [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2044.0800000000002s)]
*  other hand, they're not involved in stopping revolutionary activity. So when I heard the [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2048.8s)]
*  DA say what he said, I thought, and you keep saying the same damn thing. What does that have [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2052.7200000000003s)]
*  to do with anything? That every citizen of LA hasn't risen up and committed acts of violence, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2058.7200000000003s)]
*  aren't participating in riots in order to keep criminal illegal aliens in the country. That's [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2066.88s)]
*  not the issue. The issue is the ones who do rise up. I'll be right back. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2072.48s)]
*  Americans sent President Trump back to Washington with a mandate to solve the border crisis, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2085.6800000000003s)]
*  reverse the effects of Biden's inflation and restore American greatness. But at every turn, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2090.08s)]
*  judges are blocking President Trump's attempts to fulfill this mandate. The Heritage Foundation [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2094.88s)]
*  has been closely assessing the situation. They've been able to identify legal problems with these [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2099.44s)]

*  debunking this Politico article. Go to National Review. Noah Rothman's piece is really, really good. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2146.3199999999997s)]

*  Donald Trump at the White House today. Cut three, go. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2161.52s)]
*  I can tell you, Les, that was terrible. The night before that was terrible. We have, as you've seen, [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2176.08s)]
*  it was on most of your networks, people with big heavy hammers pounding the concrete and pounding [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2182.24s)]
*  curbs, pounding and breaking up, and handing these big chunks of concrete to people. And they were [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2188.4s)]
*  taking that concrete, going up on bridges and dropping it into the roof of a car. They were [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2194.88s)]
*  throwing it at our police. They were throwing it at our soldiers that are there. And we got it stopped [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2199.52s)]
*  and we have them in custody right now. Look, if we didn't get involved, right now Los Angeles would [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2205.36s)]
*  be burning just like it was burning a number of months ago with all the houses that were lost. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2214.56s)]
*  Los Angeles right now would be on fire and we have it in great shape. I'm not playing around. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2219.1200000000003s)]
*  It's just amazing. And I have an audio list here that has Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters, [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2227.6800000000003s)]
*  Jimmy Panetta, Democrat California, Adam Schiff, one of their senators, John Garamendi, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2235.6800000000003s)]
*  one of their senators. I think he was the lieutenant governor at one point. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2242.56s)]
*  Every single Democrat except Fetterman. Every single Democrat except Fetterman. No wonder they [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2248.2400000000002s)]

*  somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building, we once again make contact [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2311.52s)]
*  with our leader, Mike Levin. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2317.12s)]
*  Man, we got so much more. We're going to keep at it, but we're going to bounce around a little bit [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2323.2799999999997s)]
*  because I just saw this piece by Noah Rothman, National Review, about half an hour ago. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2330.88s)]
*  It's a very smart piece and this is a very smart audience. So many of you will identify with this. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2337.12s)]
*  This offer won't be around forever, said Secretary of State Marco Rubio last month. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2342.16s)]
*  The warning accompanied the Trump administration's overture to Iran and what it built is the best it [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2346.8799999999997s)]
*  could do if Tehran hoped to avoid hostilities over its nuclear program. At some point, Rubio [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2351.3599999999997s)]
*  continued, decisions will have to be made about more maximum pressure and other options because [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2356.96s)]
*  Iran can never have a nuclear weapon. The decision was made to stop the nuclear weapon [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2361.8399999999997s)]
*  and to stop the nuclear program because Iran can never have a nuclear weapon. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2367.84s)]
*  It's almost one month later, he writes, and we appear no closer to the point of exhaustion. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2373.6000000000004s)]
*  The Iranians took Trump's proposal, one that multiple reports indicated would have allowed [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2377.6800000000003s)]
*  Iran to enrich uranium on its soil despite administration officials' insistence that it [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2382.88s)]
*  would accept no indigenous enrichment capacity, balled it up and threw it back in our faces. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2387.36s)]
*  They're just asking for things that you can't do, Trump told reporters yesterday. They seek [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2393.92s)]
*  enrichment. We can't have enrichment. That's what Trump said. And yet the eternal talks are [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2400.08s)]
*  set to continue this weekend in Muscat, where the delegates will presumably restate their mutually [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2406.16s)]
*  exclusive and unbridgeable positions once again. For some inexplicable reason, Politico, that would [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2412.16s)]
*  be Ruth Bade, Politico surveyed this landscape and determined that the GOP hawks are in the [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2421.68s)]
*  driver's seat. No, what happened was Chatsworth leaked to her, gave her the story, and she was [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2429.84s)]
*  the stenographer. That's what he does. That's what Politico does. That's what happened. It was a [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2436.32s)]
*  planted story. And so she looks like a damn noble fool. Owing to an obvious overreliance on the [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2443.92s)]
*  restrainers, quote unquote, and the Trump administration as sources, a group that is eager to leak to the [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2450.64s)]
*  press and private as they are to condemn the mainstream media for the benefit of their [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2455.36s)]
*  constituents, and we saw that in a New York Times piece about Chatsworth, Politico's dispatch sounds [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2459.6s)]
*  the alarms of the degree to which security-minded Americans, not, you know, the Iranians, are [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2466.32s)]
*  scuttling the prospects for peace. The evidence? The existence of radio host Mark Levin, for one. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2471.04s)]
*  Levin has warned the administration that Iran could be days away from building a fissionable device, [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2477.84s)]
*  something Trump's own intelligence team has told the president is not accurate, Politico noted. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2483.52s)]
*  That would be comforting, save for the dubious source of those comforting words and the [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2488.8s)]
*  contradictory evidence indicating that Iran is already a threshold nuclear state. I'm going to [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2493.2799999999997s)]
*  hold Politico to this too, by the way. In addition, Levin has impugned the competency of Trump's all-purpose [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2498.56s)]
*  negotiator, he writes, Steve Witkoff, who has little to show for all his globetrotting so far. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2504.4s)]
*  That's him writing. Beyond Levin, the MAGA movement is equally irritated with the New York Post [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2510.48s)]
*  editorial board, which has independently arrived at many of Levin's conclusions. Quote, there's [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2515.7599999999998s)]
*  clearly a lobby for war with Iran versus those who are more aligned with the president, unquote, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2520.56s)]
*  one anonymous source who is obviously within the restrainer camp, insisted. It's too bad they're [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2525.68s)]
*  not the restrainer camp for Iran, by the way. The thing is, this unnamed senior administration [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2531.44s)]
*  official might be right. The so-called restrainer set may be closer to the president's instincts. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2538.0s)]
*  Their problem is that the world simply refuses to comply with their notions of how it should work. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2544.0s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard's problem? Isn't that we're closer to the brink of nuclear annihilation than ever [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2549.6s)]
*  before, quote, unquote? Her problem is that Trump is becoming increasingly frustrated with Russia's [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2554.56s)]
*  refusal to abandon its war of conquest in the face of mounting American gestures of goodwill. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2559.84s)]
*  She now implies that anything other than more unrequited gestures will beget nuclear armageddon, [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2565.68s)]
*  not because that's true, but because that argument might persuade the president to [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2571.52s)]
*  toe her pacifist line. Likewise, JD Vance, Tucker Carlson, Charlie Kirk, Jack Posbiak, [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2575.92s)]
*  these are the people mentioned in the Politico piece that was planted by that side of the aisle. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2584.16s)]
*  The cast of unnamed restrainers on whom Politico relies for juicy quotes say their problem is with [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2592.08s)]
*  the right's hawks, but that's misdirection. Their problem is with Iran, its steadfast refusal to [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2597.6s)]
*  give up its enrichment capabilities. The Americans who will not continents allowing the Islamic [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2603.8399999999997s)]
*  Republic to break out with a nuclear weapon at a time and place of its choosing. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2609.04s)]
*  Their fear isn't that the hawks are winning the argument, it's that they're losing it. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2613.84s)]
*  They're right about that, but it's no one's fault but their own. Like Barack Obama's brain [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2618.96s)]
*  trust before them, they approached foreign policy from a highly theoretical perspective. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2624.24s)]
*  Obama's foreign policy practitioners refused to revisit the flawed framework they applied to [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2629.92s)]
*  international affairs even after it proved itself fatally flawed. Instead, they blamed [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2635.52s)]
*  their shortcomings on domestic political opponents who were accused of engineering the obstacles in [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2641.28s)]
*  the way of Obama's success, but the former president's critics didn't create those obstacles, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2646.24s)]
*  they merely noticed them. If the past is prologue, we should expect to see Trump's frustrated advisors [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2651.36s)]
*  succumb to the bitterness that consumed Obama's team by the end of his tenure. It will be our [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2658.24s)]
*  fault when the whole edifice collapses, you see, meaning mine and the others. Be warned, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2663.76s)]
*  the degree to which we will be casticated for being unworthy of their practical genius [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2668.7200000000003s)]
*  will be hard to stomach. We can take solace in the fact that it is a coping mechanism, [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2673.5200000000004s)]
*  one that is on full display in Politico's exposé. The problems besetting Trump in relation to Iran [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2679.76s)]
*  are, according to this reporting, myriad. The hawks, the pro-military community, the Israelis, [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2687.6s)]
*  they all bedevil and confound our peaceable president. Nonsense. His problem, our problem, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2693.92s)]
*  is reality. And that reality, ladies and gentlemen, is Iran. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2702.16s)]
*  Brilliantly written by Noah Rothman, a senior writer at N.R. So I wanted to point that out to [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2708.96s)]
*  you because he's right, because it's obvious to a number of people, including me, that these people [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2716.56s)]
*  are getting desperate. Desperate. Because the hawks are going to win the argument. No, because [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2720.72s)]
*  Iran will not capitulate. Iran's not biting. And so their answer is, so Iran gets a nuclear weapon. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2725.68s)]
*  They've shifted their position. So now it's manageable. What's the problem? Pakistan has one. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2736.16s)]
*  Other countries have one. We heard that from Chatsworth Osborne, Jr. We've heard it from others, [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2745.12s)]
*  who I won't name, one of them my friends, because it's stupid. Because those other countries haven't [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2751.2799999999997s)]
*  declared effectively war against us. They're not run by terrorists who keep talking about destroying [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2756.72s)]
*  America. They're not focused on wiping out Israel or cities in America. There is a little difference, [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2761.04s)]
*  you know, if you use your noggin. But this is the problem with ideologues versus those who are [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2767.7599999999998s)]
*  prudent. I'm prudent. There are many cases where I don't support going into war. This was one of [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2773.2s)]
*  the complaints about John McCain and some of the others. I was no McCain guy. But that said, [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2778.8799999999997s)]
*  these people are ideological isolationists. I posted Tulsi Gabbard's unbelievably crazy video [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2786.8799999999997s)]
*  of Hiroshima and her comments on it and her graphics and so forth, where she applies no context [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2797.36s)]
*  whatsoever for what went down and why it went down. This crowd says they're America first. They hate [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2804.32s)]
*  us. They hate us. And so now Truman, the dropping of the two bombs, it was our fault. And the [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2811.1200000000003s)]
*  consequences were so horrendous, and they were horrendous, that it shouldn't have been done. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2822.72s)]
*  Now this is somebody keeps talking about the forever war. We can't have a forever war. The [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2829.12s)]
*  forever wars, the forever wars. Well, World War II was not a forever war, was it? But then I think [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2832.72s)]
*  to myself, not only does she get us wrong, the United States of America, instinctively, she's [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2838.24s)]
*  always trashing us. What else does she get wrong? Well, she just gave an example of a nuclear weapon [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2844.72s)]
*  or an atomic bomb, I should say two of them. We're trying to prevent Iran from getting a [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2851.92s)]
*  nuclear weapon. Shouldn't she be at the forefront of fighting that? Apparently not. Apparently not. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2857.84s)]
*  The difference between me and them, you see, is I'm on the record. My name's attached to what I do. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2868.16s)]
*  The words are coming out of my mouth. I don't have five anonymous sources going to [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2874.08s)]
*  Politico because they're cowards. Absolute cowards. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2878.8s)]
*  And when we come back, back to the insurrection at hand, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2887.6000000000004s)]
*  this insurrection is led by the Democrat Party. That's what it is. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2892.4s)]
*  It is an insurrection by the Democrat Party. Before it was BLM, then it was the Islamists on [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2896.5600000000004s)]
*  our college campuses, now it's illegal aliens and a whole bunch of other people. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2903.6000000000004s)]
*  They always come to the defense of the insurrectionists, the violent rioters. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2907.2799999999997s)]
*  They're not the ones that held hearings on these colleges and universities. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2912.72s)]
*  They're not the ones calling for law and order. No, they're calling for the opposite. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2916.08s)]
*  I'll be right back. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=2921.6s)]

*  tomorrow in a hearing Thursday. Earlier in the day, the Trump administration called Newsom's motion [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3025.12s)]
*  for an emergency temporary restraining order legally meritless in pursuit of an extraordinary, [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3030.64s)]
*  unprecedented, and dangerous court order, claiming the court has no authority. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3035.2s)]
*  Now folks, this is a wildly reckless lawsuit. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3039.2799999999997s)]
*  There is no way, I don't care how this judge ultimately rules, there is no way [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3047.4399999999996s)]
*  that this can be upheld because it violates not only the constitutional powers of the federal [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3054.48s)]
*  government under these circumstances, but our own precedent. This is a frivolous case. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3060.3199999999997s)]
*  Now you and I, as well as people in the state, we're going to be left paying for all this, [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3065.9199999999996s)]
*  paying for all this. So you have a cleanup underway, and Newsom, I hope, is sealing his [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3072.24s)]
*  political death warrant with filings like this, filings like this. Newsom's effort to block [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3080.24s)]
*  federal incursion in California comes a day after Trump doubled the National Guard presence in LA [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3087.7599999999998s)]
*  to 4,000, deployed 700 Marines. Look how they write about this at USA Yesterday. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3092.8s)]
*  And then they talk about the cost of this, like it's Trump creating the costs. The media are so [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3102.4s)]
*  sick. I spent a half hour explaining to Politico how sick those bastards are. The media are so sick. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3107.44s)]
*  Since Friday, officers have had confrontations with protesters lately, [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3117.04s)]
*  confrontations with protesters leading to the use of pepper spray, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3120.96s)]
*  flashbangs as officials announced more than 150 arrests. By the way, five officers now have been [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3124.2400000000002s)]
*  injured. Now remember, we have the 2026 World Cup coming, the Olympics coming, [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3129.84s)]
*  and the city's burning, at least part of it. Oh, the DA says, well, it's only part of the city. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3140.8s)]
*  Dana Bash or Donna Bash as the Stalinist, Bernie Sanders calls her Donna Bash. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3147.04s)]
*  Why they bring this thug on all the time. I don't even know to comment on this stuff. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3154.96s)]
*  Trump is a fascist, oligarch, a dictator. That's all we get out of this moron. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3158.7999999999997s)]
*  So this is absolutely without merit. And I think this judge knows it, even though he's pedigree as [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3167.2799999999997s)]
*  Democrat, but nonetheless, he doesn't want to humiliate himself. But the Democrats are making [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3174.96s)]
*  it abundantly clear. What's interesting to me, when these cities burn, it doesn't hurt most of [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3179.92s)]
*  the outer suburbs and the rural areas and so forth and so on. Big chunks of the country, [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3186.32s)]
*  it affects the metropolitan areas, the people who live there, the vast majority of whom are Democrats. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3192.56s)]
*  Do they like this? They've made it clear they don't. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3199.92s)]
*  Do they like all the illegal immigrants there? They've made it clear they don't. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3202.08s)]
*  Do they like their tax dollars being used for benefits for illegal immigrants? [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3206.0s)]
*  Excuse me, they've made it clear they don't. But you see, the Democrat Party doesn't care. Why? [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3211.2s)]
*  Well, we'll talk about that more when my book on power comes out. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3219.2s)]
*  But there is a very logical and experiential answer to that. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3225.36s)]
*  They just need to win one more election. That's how they view it. One more. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3230.08s)]
*  Then we'll get a permanent grip on the country. That's what the border was open for. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3235.04s)]
*  That's why they had the border open. We just need one more election. That's why [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3240.56s)]
*  one of their judges ruled that you don't have to have voter ID to demonstrate you're a citizen [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3245.2799999999997s)]
*  in federal elections, as they keep tearing down the [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3251.36s)]
*  barriers to fraud and keep enshrining fraud as a legitimate basis for voting. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3254.32s)]
*  They're working on the voting system. They've got the court system. They hope to topple the [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3261.52s)]
*  Supreme Court with a bunch of lunatic appointments once. You know, I think Clarence Thomas is like [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3265.1200000000003s)]
*  80 years old. I fear about this. I worry about this. And I think that's the only way to get [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3271.2000000000003s)]
*  the people to vote. I think that's the only way to get the people to vote. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3278.96s)]
*  And that's their attitude because they're going to permanently change the government. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3282.8s)]
*  Look, this is what they do in state after state. This is what they did in Illinois, [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3287.44s)]
*  which had been a Republican state. This is what they do in California, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3292.08s)]
*  which had been a Republican state. This is what they've done in Georgia or trying to do in Georgia. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3294.8s)]
*  Once they get their hands on the governorship there, it's all over. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3299.44s)]
*  And they've done it in many states. It's not that long ago where Ronald Reagan won 49 states [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3302.24s)]
*  and he almost won Minnesota. But everything's changed. The voting system has changed. The [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3307.28s)]
*  demographics, immigration system have changed. The judiciary has been changed by the hard left, [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3312.32s)]
*  by the American Marxists. But now they're out of the closet. They're out of the closet. They're [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3320.16s)]
*  out of the closet. They're actually out there defending the hoodlums, the rioters, [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3326.64s)]
*  the arsonists, even the criminals. They're very clever. They're very slick, [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3333.68s)]
*  although the people are onto them. Listen, I favor due process. Just because I was down there [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3340.8s)]
*  in El Salvador with Garcia, who's sort of a subhuman lowlife, that doesn't mean I support [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3347.04s)]
*  Garcia. I support due process, says Van Hollen of Maryland. While they were basically [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3353.2s)]
*  sharing a wet kiss down there, it was so disgusting. And notice the media came to their defense too, [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3361.4399999999996s)]
*  and they always do. Tell me, why is CNN still around? They have no viewers. They got to have [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3367.04s)]
*  George Clooney on there to get some numbers, but George Clooney isn't going to do a [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3373.7599999999998s)]
*  a dance and sing event every weekend. So why is CNN an MSNBC? This is the kind of quality [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3377.8399999999997s)]
*  programming you get at MSNBC. Here's Rachel Maddow, who's never been right about anything. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3388.08s)]
*  And if I read reports correctly, makes $20 million for a show once a week. Is that right, Mr. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3393.04s)]
*  Producer? It pays to be a Marxist cuck, doesn't it? Cut 12, go. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3397.9199999999996s)]
*  I mean, the difference between when he was talking about that then and what he's doing now is that [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3405.2s)]
*  whether or not he remembers what he once knew about how America works, he's decided that he's [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3409.12s)]
*  throwing it all out. You know, dictator from day one and, you know, going to terminate parts of [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3415.2799999999997s)]
*  the Constitution. And he's decided that he doesn't matter what kind of [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3421.2799999999997s)]

*  and order to a Democrat city that is overwhelmed with illegal aliens and others. He's trying to [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3437.12s)]
*  bring peace and order back to our colleges and universities when lunatics like Maddow and her [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3444.16s)]

*  Comcast, an MSNBC, to constantly call the president a dictator for their hosts to keep calling him [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3456.64s)]
*  Hitler and other names. I blame this on these corporatist media organizations. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3461.7599999999998s)]

*  To say what a liar this Gavin Newsom is, it was fascinating to watch Fox with John Roberts. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3556.16s)]
*  President Trump was watching a fox as he was winging his way, I think, to Fort Bragg. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3563.2s)]
*  And Newsom, you know, said that Trump did not call him because Trump had mentioned that a presser, [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3568.4s)]
*  not a formal press event, but on the tarmac or wherever, maybe on the plane, that he had in fact [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3576.16s)]
*  spoken with Newsom the day or the night before and told him what he thought. And I played that clip [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3581.6s)]
*  for you. Newsom denied that it occurred. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3588.32s)]

*  have Jacob Soboroff, a reporter on MSNBC outside a Home Depot in LA. These aren't reporters. These [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3753.44s)]
*  aren't serious journalists and their guests are just advocates for criminal activity. Cut 14, go. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3760.96s)]
*  The big picture is Los Angeles is a so-called majority minority city in a majority minority [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3769.92s)]
*  state. There are more people of color that live in Los Angeles than white people at this point. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3776.0s)]
*  Many of those people are undocumented. By some counts, 10% of the population of LA County, [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3781.52s)]
*  one of the largest counties, the largest county by population in the United States, [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3786.7200000000003s)]
*  is undocumented. Maybe as many as a million people. Those people are our neighbors, [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3790.56s)]
*  our coworkers, our classmates, our friends, our parishioners, fellow parishioners in churches. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3794.56s)]
*  Our murderers, our rapists, our pedophiles, [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3801.84s)]
*  our fraudsters that steal social security and other benefits. I mean, [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3804.24s)]
*  they're not all perfect, are they, Mr. Reporter? And Trump's going after the worst of the worst [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3812.08s)]
*  first, isn't he? The worst of the worst attacks some of your neighbors, your friends, your [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3817.44s)]
*  fellow parishioners who are legal aliens. You're not standing up for them. You're standing up for [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3823.36s)]
*  the criminals and you're supposed to be a reporter, but you're not a reporter. You're a propagandist. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3828.08s)]
*  Now, ladies and gentlemen, I don't know what it's going to take in this country with the Democrats [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3832.48s)]
*  and the constituency that's growing, illegal aliens, Islamists, Marxists, and other reprobates. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3838.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't know what it's going to take. Apparently, the riots aren't going to convince the Democrats. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3845.44s)]
*  They're all well and good for that. I mean, after all, that's just their constituents letting off [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3849.6s)]
*  a little steam. They're always peaceful, you know, peaceful protesters. It's actually become [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3853.36s)]
*  a laugh line now, but this is utter lawlessness. It's just like when Doge was coming up with all [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3860.96s)]
*  this fraud that was taking place and all this misapplication of massive amounts of money. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3869.52s)]
*  They were okay with that because it's going to their people, going to their causes, [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3876.16s)]
*  going to their favorite countries and so forth and so on. There's nothing wrong with it. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3881.28s)]
*  So there's no moral standards. None. Again, truthfully, I'm not allowed to do it yet, [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3885.12s)]
*  but I can't wait for my book On Power to come out. I address all of this and a lot more from [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3892.4s)]
*  a philosophical perspective and a practical perspective as it applies to current activities. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3897.6800000000003s)]
*  And I just wish I could dig into it a little bit more, but I'm not allowed to. I'm sorry, [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3905.52s)]
*  I just can't, but we will because this is very, very important to understand. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3909.36s)]
*  Very important. I'll give you a little taste, regardless of what they say. This is what I call [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3915.1200000000003s)]
*  negative power. I divide power into different categories. This is what I call negative power. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3921.6s)]
*  And negative power is power that's used. In some cases, it's a more soft negative power, [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3928.32s)]
*  a more aggressive negative power, you know, like fascism and Marxism are more aggressive [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3934.72s)]
*  forms of negative power, but the Democrat Party exercises negative power. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3940.3999999999996s)]
*  Negative power is the power to coerce. Negative power is the power to violate [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3946.3199999999997s)]
*  in order to secure power for yourself. And that's exactly what they're doing. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3954.16s)]
*  Now, obviously, I want to expand on this and explain it much more broadly and deeply when [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3961.52s)]
*  the time comes. But all of this is going to make sense. It doesn't mean it's good. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3968.0s)]
*  It doesn't mean you like it. It doesn't mean you do it or anybody else should do it. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3973.92s)]
*  But it's all going to make sense because I hear on TV and everywhere else all the time. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3979.2s)]
*  Don't they know that they're going to lose if they keep doing this? [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3983.68s)]
*  Don't they know that this is why they lost last time? Don't they know? Well, there's answers to this. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3987.12s)]
*  Because our mindset doesn't work like their mindset. Our mindset doesn't work like the [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=3997.44s)]
*  Marxist mindset, like the Islamist mindset, or quite frankly, the Democrat Party leadership's [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4002.3199999999997s)]
*  mindset, not Democrat Party members, the people who are in charge of the party, this institution [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4009.68s)]
*  that is so hostile to the United States. What are they doing? And why are they doing it? And [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4016.56s)]
*  what do they hope to get out of it? And what are they going to do in the future? Exactly. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4021.92s)]
*  It's a mindset, just like with the Iranian Islamist terrorists. It's a mindset. In order to [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4028.64s)]
*  understand what you're negotiating with, in order to understand what they're capable of, you need to [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4035.04s)]
*  understand their mindset and their pursuit of power and their purpose for the pursuit of power. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4041.12s)]
*  People can attack me all they want, but that's not going to resolve the problem. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4048.56s)]
*  They're the problem. Their mindset is the problem. Their idea of power, how to attain it, [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4054.24s)]
*  how to hold it, how to expand it, that's the problem. And so that's why I take this word [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4060.32s)]
*  and I break it down into all its component parts. And all its component parts. There it is. It's on [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4066.96s)]
*  Amazon, comes out, what, six weeks, give or take. Some of the embargoed copies will start to go out [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4073.68s)]
*  to some friends and people who might be interested in it. And I can't wait for it to come out. I'm [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4081.12s)]
*  chomping at the bit, and I want to give out as many copies over the program, signed copies as I can, [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4088.88s)]
*  but there's millions of you and there's only a couple hundred of those. But I know you're going [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4094.4s)]
*  to love it. And I want to thank Barnes and Noble this time that has made a substantial order for [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4099.52s)]
*  the books. I want to thank Costco that has pulled back on books. However, when it comes to my book, [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4104.96s)]
*  they've made a substantial order for the books. I want to thank, obviously, Amazon, which always [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4110.56s)]
*  makes a significant order for the books and makes them available to you and has them available to [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4117.04s)]
*  you right now, as do the others, by the way, except for Costco. But I want to thank them, [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4122.24s)]
*  because I see none of the censorship going on that went on before. Who else? Some of the other [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4127.599999999999s)]
*  retail stores that are not really known for book selling, they're taking it. Sam's Club is known [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4135.28s)]
*  for that. They're taking a substantial number. And some of the others that turned their backs [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4141.76s)]
*  on us last time, they are as well. So this should be a pretty big book in the sense of the content. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4149.84s)]
*  I don't know what big means anymore. I'm told the publishing industry is soft. Book sales are soft. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4156.8s)]
*  I believe that to be true. I believe that to be true. But my audience is different. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4161.52s)]
*  My viewers and listeners are different. You, you're smart. You want to know what's going on, [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4168.88s)]
*  what you can do about it. You want to embrace it. And so I've got the price way down. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4174.16s)]
*  Once the discounts kick in, the price will be even lower. I'm very excited about this. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4180.5599999999995s)]
*  And yet this book, I have to admit, some of the pages you're going to have to hit, Mr. Producer, [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4185.04s)]
*  you hear me reading the audio, right? We're taping the audio this week. Some of it's pretty heavy, [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4189.28s)]
*  isn't it? But Mr. Producer loves it. You can open your mic because you're the guy who's recording it. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4194.88s)]
*  We've gone through a third of it. We're going to do another third tonight and then another third [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4204.24s)]
*  over the weekend. But it flows, you said, and it is heavy. But on the other hand, it's understandable. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4207.84s)]
*  Yeah, correct. Yeah. So I think people are going to like this book. It's very important. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4214.0s)]
*  Look, I have other things to do. I don't have to write books. But I think it's very important. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4220.24s)]
*  I know you're going to like it on power. kept it short and sweet on power in the cover. The book is [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4226.5599999999995s)]
*  a very classic look. Sort of the old time books by, you know, a Buckley or Goldwater or Freeman [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4233.44s)]
*  or something like that. I said, let's keep it very basic and classic. And that's what we've done. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4242.32s)]
*  I'll be right back. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4248.4s)]
*  Pure Talk, my wireless company, a veteran led company, leaves every man and woman who has [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4257.12s)]

*  And listen to this. That's why Pure Talk is on a mission to give an allegiance flag, [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4267.360000000001s)]

*  Switch your cell phone service to Pure Talk today. Know that you're supporting a company [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4278.96s)]
*  that will be providing these high quality flags made in America to deserving veterans with plans [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4283.52s)]

*  Switch to a wireless company that supports our veterans that is patriotic based right here in [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4315.84s)]
*  America. Switch to Pure Talk. We'll be putting out the audio everywhere with the first half hour of [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4320.88s)]
*  the program of Rachel Bade and Politico as special pleaders for Iran. I want these things to last to [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4331.360000000001s)]
*  be institutionalized to be enshrined, you know, the written word or stuff on websites, that stuff [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4339.6s)]
*  lasts forever. The spoken word does not. So I'm taking the spoken word and I'm enshrining it. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4345.12s)]
*  And so Rachel Bade will be forever known as the buffoon in the propaganda she is for the special [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4351.44s)]
*  pleaders for Iran. And that's that and Politico as well. And we'll keep an eye out for other things. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4360.4s)]
*  We'll keep doing this because it needs to be done because this is really a turning point. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4368.32s)]
*  A crossroads, a red line for whether you really want to defend this country and love it, [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4375.2s)]
*  or you're going to keep defending Iran and pretend with your propaganda that you love the country. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4381.44s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard's coming under a lot of heat, not just from [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4387.76s)]
*  rhinos and so forth, but for her ridiculous bizarre video, warning of a nuclear war, [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4392.5599999999995s)]
*  except apparently when it comes to Iran. You know, you can't take the left wing out of the [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4398.72s)]
*  person. Maybe you can take the person out of the left wing or something to that effect. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4406.0s)]
*  She is what she is. And I just hope that she's making sure that all the proper look, [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4411.52s)]
*  what Politico could do is a real story on how the isolationists, the sort of Bernie Sanders [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4418.240000000001s)]
*  Republicans, the Bernie Sanders right, are trying to infiltrate all aspects of our foreign policy [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4425.84s)]
*  establishment. That's a real story. There's names, you know, it's the Charles Cokeheads, [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4432.24s)]
*  the Charles Cokeheads, the Quincy Institute and institutes like that, [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4440.24s)]
*  who have this isolationist attitude of the radical libertarians. We've seen this before [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4446.72s)]
*  in American history. That's a real story, rather than fabricating a story about me, [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4453.52s)]
*  because it's leaked to you by Chatsworth Osborne Jr. and the other reprobates. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4458.240000000001s)]
*  But Rachel Bade wasn't up to it. She's not capable of that. So it's going to take a real journalist, [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4465.76s)]
*  not a clown like her. But we'll have that audio ready at some point. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4471.280000000001s)]

*  we will do what we do. So this from the Jewish insider DNI Tulsi Gabbard draws friendly fire [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4484.0s)]
*  from Republicans for video warning of nuclear war. GOP Senator John Kennedy responding to her. She's [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4490.4800000000005s)]
*  obviously needs to change her meds. It's a disgusting video, I'll be honest with you. Of course, [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4497.360000000001s)]
*  what happened was horrific, but she basically points the finger at the United States military. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4503.52s)]
*  You really need to check this video out. I have it on my social sites. A cryptic video, [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4510.16s)]
*  they write, that director of national Intel Gabbard [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4516.24s)]
*  that she made really is unbelievable. We'll be right back. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4520.639999999999s)]
*  That's the reason the border is open. That's the reason they oppose deportations. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4601.12s)]
*  That's the reason they're trashing ICE. That's the reason they're doing everything they do. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4606.32s)]
*  If you think about this, they don't care if there's waste, fraud and abuse. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4612.16s)]
*  They've created so many of these Potemkin programs and grants and contracts and all the rest of it. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4621.28s)]
*  As long as enough of it gets to their buddies and gets to their programs and [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4629.92s)]
*  helps build a constituency for them, they don't care if they get one dollar's worth out of a hundred dollars. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4634.88s)]
*  It's not their money. It's not their money. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4641.12s)]
*  It's not their money. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4647.52s)]
*  Now, I'm saying that we, you and I, and these commentators, many of our friends on Fox and Talk [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4654.240000000001s)]
*  Radio, we think like normal people. That is, people who play by the rules. People who expect [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4661.76s)]
*  others to play by the rules. And that includes not committing violent criminal acts, [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4670.16s)]
*  and so forth and so on. The Democrats don't think that way. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4677.6s)]
*  The Democrat Party is a nomenclature. What is the Democrat Party? [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4683.4400000000005s)]
*  It's an organization. An organization of what? [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4691.68s)]
*  It's an organization that has as its primary objective power. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4697.360000000001s)]
*  The Marxists have as their primary objective power. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4702.24s)]
*  The Islamists have as their primary objective power. You and I, [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4706.72s)]
*  we believe in a constitutional system where power is divided. It's dispersed. It's checked. It's balanced. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4712.8s)]
*  So power, yes, but power checked by power. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4721.68s)]
*  Checked by power. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4728.719999999999s)]
*  You cannot have liberty without the proper kind of power. You cannot have rights without the proper [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4733.759999999999s)]
*  kind of power. You look at Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders is a Stalinist. He went to a [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4740.639999999999s)]
*  Stalinist kibbutz as a young man in Israel. Not just a communist kibbutz. He sought out a Stalinist [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4749.919999999999s)]
*  kibbutz like Noam Chomsky. They went to the same kibbutz. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4754.88s)]
*  They're not about democratic rule. They're about rule. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4763.68s)]
*  And this is discussed at great length in this book. And not just them. They're just foils. There's [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4773.52s)]
*  other individuals. And I'm not really focused on individuals. I'm focused on events and things [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4779.68s)]
*  that are happening and things that can happen if things aren't set up properly. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4785.200000000001s)]
*  So when you see the riots in the streets and you see [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4792.56s)]
*  not just the Marxist Islamist Democrats in Congress and in the media, [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4797.200000000001s)]
*  but people like Gavin Newsom, who's just a really stupid [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4802.96s)]
*  goofy incompetent left of center Democrat. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4809.76s)]
*  They do what they do to defend their new constituency, [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4818.0s)]
*  their future voters, their children and the birthright citizenship. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4824.88s)]
*  Because in a relatively free society and in a democracy, and I know we're a republic. I [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4831.76s)]
*  don't want to get into that right now. I'm using democracy sort of as a generic term. Okay. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4838.56s)]
*  And in a democracy, the best way to become a one party country and the best way to hold on to that [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4843.6s)]
*  power is not through the ballot box. It's not by honoring the Constitution and all of its checks [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4853.280000000001s)]
*  and authorities and all the rest of it. It's not through law enforcement. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4860.56s)]
*  When you have these sort of mini revolutions going on in one city or another or one state in another, [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4864.96s)]
*  virtually now every summertime, but even more than that on our college campuses, [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4874.0s)]
*  this is what they've wrought. This isn't an accident. This is reality. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4878.72s)]
*  And I come behind this microphone and I explain all the foreign money that's coming into this [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4885.2s)]
*  country from Qatar, from Iran, from Hamas, from the communist Chinese. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4888.96s)]
*  That's not an accident. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4897.76s)]
*  Remember that communist phrase, the ends justify the means. They'll take money from anywhere. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4903.76s)]
*  It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter that there's bloat. It doesn't matter that USAID funded terrorists [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4910.4s)]
*  among others. It doesn't matter. What matters is you have an infrastructure, an institution [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4915.76s)]
*  that needs to stay in place, that needs to get as much money as possible, as much authority as [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4921.4400000000005s)]
*  possible. Why? Because in the end, you're not going to be ruling yourself to the extent that [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4926.88s)]
*  there's voting. It doesn't matter. You have a permanent fourth branch of government that [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4936.64s)]
*  doesn't exist in the constitution. You have judges who don't follow the law. They abuse the law [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4941.28s)]
*  to advance their personal policy objectives. That is the left-wing objectives. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4948.48s)]
*  Where our judges sit there and they're trying to figure out what does the constitution require? [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4952.48s)]
*  What does the constitution say? What do the framers mean? The other guys hate the constitution [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4956.96s)]
*  and they push their agenda through legalese and then wrap it in the constitution. There's a big [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4964.16s)]
*  difference. Revolution by immigration. I was giving you a hint over the last six months. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4969.44s)]
*  That's what you see here. The leaders of the most vile, violent Islamist movements in the Middle [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4978.879999999999s)]
*  East have talked about revolution by immigration. They talk about conquering France, which they've [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4985.839999999999s)]
*  done. They talk about conquering England, which they're in the middle of. They talk about conquering [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4991.44s)]
*  the United States with immigration. So you have the American Marxists in America. That is, [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=4996.0s)]
*  the leadership of the Democrat Party. You have the Islamists. So the Marxists open the border [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5000.56s)]
*  and the Islamists come in. And so on our college campuses, you have a fusion of the Marxists and [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5007.28s)]
*  the Islamists. Now, ladies and gentlemen, this isn't fanciful. This isn't a conspiracy theory. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5012.4s)]
*  You're living it. You're seeing it. That's why I want you to get the book on power because [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5019.84s)]
*  look, do I want to sell as many as I can? Yes. But why do I want to sell as many as I can? [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5029.2s)]
*  My wife's not here right now. I'd bring her in and put her behind the microphone to speak briefly, [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5035.360000000001s)]
*  but she knows why I write these books. I bounce things off her. I explain what I'm doing. I'm [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5040.24s)]
*  explaining why I'm doing them and so forth. I'm not sitting here counting shekels. I'm sitting [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5045.44s)]
*  here trying to count what we can do. I'm the one that told the publisher to cut the price. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5050.639999999999s)]
*  I'm the one telling you to order the book early so you get the best discount possible from amazon.com. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5061.12s)]
*  It's what it is. It's called capitalism, but there are ways to get the values down, [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5067.36s)]
*  the prices down, which is what I've tried to do to get this in as many hands as humanly possible. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5071.12s)]
*  I've never read an entire book for an audio series. Now you'll be able to get an audio or [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5078.48s)]
*  the hardcover because that's what I'm doing now. Why? Because of our time. We have Donald Trump. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5084.24s)]
*  Thank God, but we won't always have Donald Trump. And if they win the house, all bets are off on [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5091.5199999999995s)]
*  what they're going to do. You need to be armed with ideas and arguments and so forth. Why? [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5098.56s)]
*  Because that wins the day. It's not esoteric. It's not elitism. It wins the day. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5103.76s)]
*  I hope this makes sense. We'll be right back. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5118.080000000001s)]
*  Did Tulsi Gabbard represent a congressional district in Hawaii? I know she did. Did it include Pearl Harbor? [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5128.96s)]
*  I'm sitting here just thinking about this. Does she know what happened at Pearl Harbor? [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5142.320000000001s)]
*  You know, I gave her the benefit of the doubt. I didn't oppose her. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5150.64s)]
*  Didn't exactly support her when she was nominated, but I felt the president should get everybody he [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5155.5199999999995s)]
*  wants and he still should. But I do think that when they're out there cutting their own videos [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5159.5199999999995s)]
*  and saying their own things, they should do the very best not to embarrass the administration, [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5165.759999999999s)]
*  even more not to embarrass the country. This is where I draw the line. You don't defend our military. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5170.719999999999s)]
*  You don't defend the service of the men who died fighting Imperial Japan. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5179.2s)]
*  Imperial Japan? I take it very personally. My grandfather fought at Iwo Jima in Guam, [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5183.84s)]
*  and my great uncle fought at Guadalcanal. And my grandfather told me a lot of things about the [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5189.12s)]
*  Japanese and how they fought and what they did to our soldiers. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5195.92s)]
*  Maybe she's not familiar with the Battle of Okinawa, which was one of the costliest and [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5200.240000000001s)]
*  bloodiest in the war, and I believe the costliest and bloodiest of the Pacific campaign. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5205.04s)]
*  And so Harry Truman concluded that we can't invade the island nation of Japan. We'll lose half a million to a million men. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5209.12s)]
*  And you would think the fifth column isolationists would understand this because [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5223.84s)]
*  they don't believe in forever wars, correct? Now they offered the Japanese a full unconditional surrender, [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5227.92s)]
*  and the Emperor said no. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5237.12s)]
*  So they hit Hiroshima, and they prayed to God that that atomic bomb would work. And then they had one more, [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5243.599999999999s)]
*  and only one more, that was configured somewhat differently, and they dropped it on Nagasaki. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5249.04s)]
*  And then the Japanese surrendered. But I want you to think about this. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5258.4s)]
*  It took two atomic bombs to defeat the Japanese. They were not going to surrender. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5261.92s)]
*  That's what Truman meant when he said we lose, he was told, half a million to a million men, [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5269.36s)]
*  because we had fought all up and down those Pacific islands, and we lost a lot of men in horrendous ways. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5274.8s)]
*  So you just have to ask yourself, how can somebody put out a three or four minute video [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5281.76s)]
*  and leave out completely all the context? And remember, they attacked us in Pearl Harbor, [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5286.96s)]
*  in Hawaii, which I believe she represented, or at least a district in Hawaii. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5294.4s)]
*  But why do I have to argue with her? Why do we have to debate her? I feel like I'm arguing with [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5300.56s)]
*  Bernie Sanders or Barack Obama or something like that, Mr. Producer. I really do. I'm not trying to [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5304.8s)]
*  be controversial. She put out the video. There's a lot of people, not just me, who are questioning [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5313.12s)]
*  this, but I'm questioning it, because I take it very personally. And you can't say you defend [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5317.36s)]
*  the military and you defend America and all when you keep crapping all over it, like Iran. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5324.24s)]
*  It's not me, it's not others who think like me, patriotic red-blooded Americans, [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5331.2s)]
*  conservatives, who didn't have to actually transition to conservatism, have always been. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5337.2s)]
*  We're not the problems when it comes to Iran. Iran's the problem when it comes to Iran. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5347.44s)]
*  That's the problem, Iran. They're the warmongers. And when you have people, the isolationists, [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5356.5599999999995s)]
*  who keep saying the things that they say, leaking the things that they leak, [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=5365.2s)]

*  During Germany, they don't teach it. They just omit it as if it never happened. They [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6134.240000000001s)]
*  can show they did the same thing in Japan. So the thing is, you're such a historical expert. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6137.6s)]
*  I love listening to you and I appreciate everything you do. I just wanted to mention [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6142.08s)]
*  I had a couple of comments next to my call. I want to talk to you about a family of friends [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6144.88s)]
*  of mine that were Jewish-Persians barely escaped with the shot when he was taken down by the [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6148.32s)]
*  muhammas and what that whole incident was. Next time I call in, we'll go over that. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6152.719999999999s)]
*  All right, my friend. Thank you, Ryan. Appreciate it. What's that, Rich? [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6157.5199999999995s)]
*  Let me slip in one more though. Let's go to Dave, our friend Dave in Surprise, Arizona. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6162.88s)]
*  KKNT. Dave, how are you? [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6168.88s)]
*  Full of righteousness and good nation, just like you, sir. Appreciate it. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6172.5599999999995s)]
*  You got it. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6176.639999999999s)]
*  Looking at the LA riots, I predicted this on Gorka's show six months ago, seven months ago, [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6177.5199999999995s)]
*  the country would burn like 2020. But I think it's actually good for the rest of the country [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6185.36s)]
*  to see it because it's the third leg of the stool of discernment that we need to see. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6190.32s)]
*  The lie that was COVID-19, the stolen election, and then the riots. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6197.12s)]
*  Mm-hmm. All right, brother, and Gorka's great. He's great. I'm glad he's over at the NSC and [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6203.200000000001s)]
*  they haven't whacked him yet. He's a good man. Thank you for your call, my friend. I'll be right back. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6209.6s)]
*  How do I do this without causing a problem, Mr. Producer? [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6216.0s)]
*  Well, let me do it this way. On June 24th, we have a big announcement. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6234.56s)]
*  We do this every two years. Big announcement. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6238.48s)]
*  How can I first come first served? Is that a good way to put it, Rich? Should I say any more? No. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6242.24s)]
*  June 24th, you're going to want to listen, especially the first hour. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6251.679999999999s)]
*  Should I say especially if you're on the West Coast or not? No, I better not. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6257.84s)]
*  You better cover that up. All right. Let's go to Sandra Gutenberg, New Jersey. Sandra, [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6262.48s)]
*  how are you tonight? Oh, I'm doing very well. Thank you. Thank you for taking my call. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6269.6s)]
*  I wanted to say two things. One, I care about the Jewish people like you and like all of us, [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6275.76s)]
*  and it's very sad and frightening what's happening. I just read today that the Holocaust Museum [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6282.400000000001s)]
*  in Washington is actually under attack. What they want to do, Mark, is they want to minimize [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6289.6s)]
*  its importance by putting other causes in there, like going to a store. This is one area to consider. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6295.2s)]
*  This is the same thing. That museum should be strictly for the Holocaust. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6303.44s)]
*  You should call Sid Rosenberg tomorrow morning on WABC. He'll fight like hell over there. I think [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6310.96s)]
*  he's on the board now, or he's going to be, and deservedly so. He's a fantastic man and a dear [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6318.32s)]
*  friend. If he's not listening, pass that on to him. Give him a call tomorrow. I'm sure he'll look [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6324.64s)]
*  into that. Okay. Can I tell you one other thing that I did? Sure. Okay. I had an incident in my [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6330.56s)]
*  building. A very lovely man who was very misinformed about the Jewish people. I didn't know how to [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6339.84s)]
*  handle this because he's a friend in the building. I had this book that Alan Dershowitz authored. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6346.56s)]
*  It's called The Ten Big Anti-Israel Lies and How to Refute Them with Truth. I read it and I had [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6354.64s)]
*  answers for him, but I'm going to let him read this book because that's another thing that I wanted [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6361.68s)]
*  to say. We have to learn how to give answers to these things that they say to us. That's true, [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6368.88s)]
*  but we're dealing with people who hate America and hate our guts. First of all, Alan writes the [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6375.2s)]
*  best books, and that is a fantastic book. We're talking now about the importation. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6381.84s)]
*  You're right about your situation, but I'm talking about the importation of Islamists [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6388.72s)]
*  who come here and don't give a damn what books they read or don't give a damn about anything else. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6393.92s)]
*  They bring their ideology. They bring their indoctrination. That is a problem, but I do [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6399.04s)]
*  agree with you. With other people, that's a good idea. All right, Sandra, thank you for your call. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6408.08s)]
*  Let's keep moving. John, San Diego, California, XM Satellite. How are you, sir? [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6413.28s)]
*  Does anyone in the government even care that the due process clause is not predicated on the person [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6420.32s)]
*  or the crime? It's predicated on the punishment. It's life, liberty, or property. It means you [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6426.08s)]
*  can't be executed, imprisoned, or fined without due process. You can damn well be deported, [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6431.5199999999995s)]
*  and that's why every other president deported millions of illegal aliens without due process. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6436.88s)]
*  It's an interesting point and thought about it, but I do know this. Whatever due process they're [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6443.2s)]
*  now claiming belonged to so many of these people, it certainly would have prevented Eisenhower from [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6449.84s)]
*  deporting over a million people. So something has changed, and I think it's the courts, [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6455.84s)]
*  the activists in the courts. Thank you for your call, my friend. I appreciate it. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6461.28s)]
*  Oh, we're out of time? Holy moly, this show went fast. Ladies and gentlemen, we salute our armed [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6466.0s)]
*  forces, police officers, firefighters, emergency personnel, our truckers, the men and women in [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6472.64s)]
*  Ukraine, the men and women in Israel, and you, the American people, red-blooded American people. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6478.16s)]
*  God bless each and every one of you. The truth shall set, set, what did I say? I hope it wasn't [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6483.68s)]
*  a curse word. My mouth broke. The truth shall set you free. See you tomorrow. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhYn4sAIXHE&t=6489.76s)]
