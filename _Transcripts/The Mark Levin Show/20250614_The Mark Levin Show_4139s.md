Video Description: This week on the Mark Levin Show, Democrats and the media are at it again, supporting violent riots, arson, and attacks on law enforcement in California, while labeling President Trump as authoritarian. A coalition of illegal aliens, Islamists, and Marxists are burning American flags, engaging in violence, and demanding to stay in America while causing this chaos.  No, Mark did not lobby President Trump on Iran policy, despite what the fake news is saying. The President knows Mark’s stance on Iran, which aligns with Trump and MAGA – prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Outlets like Politico are spreading false narratives and propaganda, particularly from isolationists and Iranian sympathizers. Mark is not leading a lobbying campaign of "GOP hawks."  Iran, and isolationist ideologies are major threats. DNI Tulsi Gabbard’s stance on nuclear war and her revisionism about the U.S. defeating Imperial Japan under Harry Truman are grotesque. Gabbard, the Quincy Institute, and people like Chatsworth Qatarlson (Tucker Carlson) are emboldening Iran’s regime by signaling American weakness.  Sen Alex Padilla barging into a Kristi Noem press conference shows a pattern of violent, lawless behavior by Democrats. Democrats reflect their violent base and their violent base represents Democrats. Padilla could have coordinated with Noem instead of causing this show. The Democrat Party is a Marxist party that represents Islamists, antisemites, Stalinists, and criminals.  They've given up on the American citizens.

# The Best Of Mark Levin - 6/14/25
**The Mark Levin Show:** [June 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8)
*  It's all quiet in the underground bunker. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=0.0s)]
*  Doors closed, locks bolted. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  But the Great One isn't just resting on his laurels. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=7.2s)]
*  He's making sure your weekend is even better by giving you his best. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=10.8s)]
*  This is the best of Mark Levin. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=15.6s)]
*  Well, the Democrats are at it again. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=19.8s)]
*  Violent riotous arson, attacking our cops. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=22.2s)]
*  Federal, state, and local. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=28.599999999999998s)]
*  Refusing to comply with law. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=31.599999999999998s)]
*  And then blaming Donald Trump for being authoritarian, a dictator. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=35.2s)]
*  I expected from the Democrat Party, I wrote a book you might recall called [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=42.2s)]
*  The Democrat Party Hates America, but it's the media. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=45.4s)]
*  On freedom of the press, I wrote that one too, but it's the media. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=49.2s)]
*  That stoke the flames, that pour the fuel on the fire. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=53.8s)]
*  Because the media now in the business of calling the good guys bad and the bad guys good. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=58.4s)]
*  Whether it's Hamas and Israel. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=63.599999999999994s)]
*  Whether it's ICE and the rioters. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=67.6s)]
*  Whether it's the cops and our college campuses. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=71.4s)]
*  Whether it's you and me. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=75.8s)]
*  And the criminals and the illegal aliens. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=77.8s)]
*  Donald Trump is doing exactly what he should do. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=82.8s)]
*  As for the use of the military, there are several statutes that allow a president to use the military. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=88.39999999999999s)]
*  And they've been used before Donald Trump ever ran for president the first time. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=97.6s)]
*  Dwight Eisenhower used the United States Army. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=103.4s)]
*  He issued an order to round up over a million illegal aliens and remove them within six months. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=105.8s)]
*  Ronald Reagan, who was governor of California, used the National Guard to put down the violence on college campuses in the 1960s. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=113.0s)]
*  George H.W. Bush in 1992 not only brought out the National Guard, but used the Insurrection Act to put down the riots yet again in Los Angeles. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=123.2s)]
*  Donald Trump so far has used the National Guard. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=134.8s)]
*  And he's sending several hundred Marines to back up the Guard. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=139.8s)]
*  The LAPD is understaffed by over a thousand officers because of their budget. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=148.20000000000002s)]
*  The chief of police says that they're overwhelmed. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=156.8s)]
*  We have a governor of California who's a drama queen. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=161.6s)]
*  He's dumb as a doorknob, probably the lowest IQ of any governor, and that's saying a lot. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=167.6s)]
*  He always does the wrong thing when the right thing should be done, whether it's the fires that took place outside of L.A. and around L.A. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=176.1s)]
*  Whether it's illegal immigration, he has spent that state into bankruptcy. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=185.6s)]
*  California was a great state, a vibrant state, a law abiding state, but it was too Republican. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=190.2s)]
*  Republicans never lost in California. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=198.89999999999998s)]
*  So the Democrats decided to change it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=201.89999999999998s)]
*  How? Through illegal immigration. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=205.39999999999998s)]
*  That's how. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=207.6s)]
*  Through taxes and regulating and productive people out of the state. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=210.2s)]
*  They destroyed the state in order so that they would have all this power, the power of a one party state. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=215.1s)]
*  You've got a mayor who is a radical, who's always been a radical. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=223.9s)]
*  You have a governor who's basically a political bureaucrat. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=229.2s)]
*  It's all he's ever known and truly stupid. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=232.79999999999998s)]
*  And he thinks he should be president. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=237.9s)]
*  Thinks he should be president, bankrupts the state, destroys law and order, opens his borders. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=241.5s)]
*  I believe we just voted against that. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=249.8s)]
*  And the media, this mostly peaceful bullcrap. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=254.5s)]
*  And now they add to that, well, it's mostly peaceful except when Trump stepped in. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=257.2s)]
*  Trump did exactly the right thing at exactly the right time, and he may need to do more and he'll do more. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=263.5s)]
*  And he won't be the first president to do more, and he likely won't be the last. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=269.3s)]
*  There's nothing that Trump has done that is dictatorial or authoritarian. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=274.5s)]
*  It's an amazing thing. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=280.40000000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump calls up the National Guard because the governor in his sanctuary state refused to do so. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=281.5s)]
*  Donald Trump wanted the National Guard to protect the Capitol building on January 6th. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=291.2s)]
*  The mayor said no. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=296.8s)]
*  The speaker said she didn't like the optics. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=298.8s)]
*  Then he's blamed for January 6th. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=301.3s)]
*  It's funny how the media forget, isn't it? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=304.0s)]
*  But they don't forget. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=306.2s)]
*  They censor, they lie, they distract. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=307.2s)]
*  We literally have illegal aliens, Islamists, and of course, Marxists, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=311.8s)]
*  rioting in LA and elsewhere. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=317.6s)]
*  Rioting. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=321.6s)]
*  Caring around the Mexican flag, and I also saw the Palestinian flag, for those who care. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=323.1s)]
*  They come into our country. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=331.0s)]
*  They steal their way into our country. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=333.1s)]
*  They take our benefits. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=335.6s)]
*  And here ICE was not doing a general roundup, which they're free to do. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=338.70000000000005s)]
*  They were going after the most hardened criminals, the murderers, the rapists, the burglars. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=344.20000000000005s)]
*  And others who've done other horrific things. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=352.9s)]
*  But look, for the Democrat Party, those are future voters. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=358.0s)]
*  They don't care. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=360.9s)]
*  They claim to care about the cops. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=363.29999999999995s)]
*  No, they don't. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=365.09999999999997s)]
*  They don't care about them at all. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=367.7s)]
*  And they never have. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=370.59999999999997s)]
*  And once again, you're told, don't believe what you see and hear. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=373.79999999999995s)]
*  This was peaceful until Donald Trump decided to step in. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=378.59999999999997s)]
*  It wasn't peaceful. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=382.1s)]
*  That's why Donald Trump did step in. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=383.1s)]
*  And not only that, they're attacking federal law enforcement. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=386.6s)]
*  It's not just a local law enforcement issue. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=390.7s)]
*  They're attacking ICE agents. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=393.2s)]
*  ICE agents, federal. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=396.7s)]
*  And he's not going to wait for the radical left-wing cook mayor and the low IQ drama [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=399.7s)]
*  queen governor to do something, because effectively they did nothing. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=404.1s)]
*  And he moved quickly, like he should have. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=411.0s)]
*  Quickly like he should have. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=414.4s)]
*  Now when you assault a federal officer, you've committed a federal offense. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=417.2s)]
*  And when you commit a federal offense, you should be prosecuted by federal prosecutors. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=421.59999999999997s)]
*  That way we can be sure that you'll do time, hopefully a lot of time. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=426.4s)]
*  18 USC Code, Section 111. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=431.59999999999997s)]
*  Whoever forcibly assaults, resists, opposes, impedes, intimidates, or interferes with any [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=439.70000000000005s)]
*  person designated in Section 1114 of this title, who are engaged in the performance [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=444.70000000000005s)]
*  of official duties, this includes border patrol, and by the way, National Guardsmen, shall [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=453.40000000000003s)]
*  be fined and imprisoned for up to one year for simple assault and up to eight years, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=458.8s)]
*  where such acts involve physical contact with the victim of that assault with the intent [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=462.90000000000003s)]
*  to commit another felony. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=468.1s)]
*  And use of a deadly or dangerous or inflicts bodily injury shall be fined, deadly or dangerous [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=470.3s)]
*  weapon or inflicts bodily injury shall be fined and imprisoned not over 20 years. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=476.6s)]
*  A simple assault does not require physical contact between the perpetrator and the federal [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=486.6s)]
*  agent. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=490.8s)]
*  This means someone can commit an assault without ever touching the officer. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=491.8s)]
*  It makes it a federal crime to assault any federal officer, agent, or employee of the [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=497.6s)]
*  U.S. government or member of the uniformed services. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=501.6s)]
*  This includes government employees on the job, it may consist of former employees as [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=506.3s)]
*  a matter of fact. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=510.1s)]
*  Examples of federal agents include, not limited to, FBI agents, border patrol agents, U.S. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=512.1s)]
*  Marshals, ATF agents, ICE agents, that's what we're talking about. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=519.3000000000001s)]
*  IRS employees, postal workers, current or retired federal judges. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=525.9s)]
*  Okay, now if you make actual physical conduct, you're on the hook for at least, excuse me, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=534.4s)]
*  for a felony up to eight years and a quarter of a million dollar in fines for each assault. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=540.4s)]
*  If it's a serious assault, you can do up to 20 years and a quarter of a million dollars [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=546.4s)]
*  in fines for each offense. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=552.1s)]
*  There's no question then that there's federal authority to prosecute. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=556.9s)]
*  There's no question there's federal authority because you're dealing with a federal agency, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=561.9s)]
*  an ICE, a Federal Immigration Enforcement Agency, these are police officers, federal [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=565.9s)]
*  police officers, who are being attacked. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=570.9s)]
*  So you don't have to sit around and wait for the radical left-wing commie mayor, you don't [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=574.9s)]
*  have to wait for the drama queen, do nothing, clown of a governor to act to call in the [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=579.9s)]
*  National Guard or, by the way, the regular military under the Insurrection Act as George [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=586.1s)]
*  H.W. Bush did. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=593.1s)]
*  But he did it when we're not even talking about attacks on federal law enforcement. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=594.1s)]
*  Here we have federal law enforcement under attack. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=599.3s)]
*  So this is a open and shut case, a black and white case, it's that simple. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=602.3s)]
*  That's it. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=607.1s)]
*  There's no question there's federal authority, none whatsoever. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=608.8000000000001s)]
*  Let's see, I'm just looking further. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=616.8000000000001s)]
*  So I wanted to lay down that predicate as we go on, to straighten out the liars in the [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=620.8000000000001s)]
*  media, the scum Democrat media liars. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=625.8000000000001s)]
*  Making your weekend even better. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=638.8000000000001s)]
*  This is the best of Mark Levin. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=642.8000000000001s)]
*  So I called the President of the United States earlier this morning, which I don't often [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=645.8000000000001s)]
*  do. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=650.3000000000001s)]
*  He and I are very close friends. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=653.3000000000001s)]
*  I know this upsets the isolationists and the fifth columnists and their media mouthpieces [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=654.8000000000001s)]
*  and propagandists. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=660.8000000000001s)]
*  I said, Mr. President, have I lobbied you about Iran? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=662.5s)]
*  He said, no. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=668.5s)]
*  I said, Mr. President, when we met last week, did I lobby you about Iran? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=672.5s)]
*  He said, no. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=678.5s)]
*  I said, Mr. President, did I ask to meet with you or did you ask to meet with me last week? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=681.5s)]
*  He said, I asked to meet with you. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=687.5s)]
*  He said, why? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=689.5s)]
*  I said, because we have a group of people who are pushing propaganda, who are pushing [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=692.2s)]
*  a narrative into Politico and other places that suggest the opposite. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=699.7s)]
*  Well, Mark, why don't you ignore them? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=707.7s)]
*  Ignore them because you and I both know it's not true. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=711.7s)]
*  It's very important that you folks understand. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=718.7s)]
*  I'm going to continue. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=720.9000000000001s)]
*  I'm not going to get into what I discussed with a president who wants to meet with me. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=722.9000000000001s)]
*  There were a number of subjects that came up. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=727.9000000000001s)]
*  As far as Iran goes, the president knows exactly where I stand on Iran. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=730.9000000000001s)]
*  And he told me he knows exactly where I stand on Iran. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=737.9000000000001s)]
*  Because he watches my shows on Fox on Saturday and Sunday. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=741.9000000000001s)]
*  The whole world knows where I stand on Iran. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=747.9000000000001s)]
*  The fifth columnists, the isolationists, know where I stand on Iran. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=750.9000000000001s)]
*  I suspect the Islamonazis and Tehran know where I stand on Iran. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=755.9000000000001s)]
*  So why is that a secret? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=760.9000000000001s)]
*  What I am not doing and what I would not do to Donald Trump is lead a lobbying campaign of hawks. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=763.9000000000001s)]
*  As it was put in Politico, war hawks. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=771.9000000000001s)]
*  I'm not leading any lobbying campaign. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=775.1s)]
*  I haven't organized any lobbying campaign, but it doesn't matter. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=778.1s)]
*  So somebody and some group, a cabal, are putting out these leaks to entities like Politico. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=783.1s)]
*  Politico is untrustworthy. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=790.1s)]
*  They took $8 million in subscriptions last year, 2024, from the taxpayers, through the government and so forth. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=792.1s)]
*  But I can tell you they're liars. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=800.1s)]
*  I can tell you that the main writer of this piece, Rachel Bade, is a liar. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=802.3000000000001s)]
*  That Rachel Bade is a propagandist. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=807.3000000000001s)]
*  That Rachel Bade is a scribe for the isolationists, for the Iranian special pleaders. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=810.3000000000001s)]
*  And let me tell you something, America. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=817.3000000000001s)]
*  These Iranian special pleaders like Chatsworth, Howard, Spord, Jr., and others, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=819.3000000000001s)]
*  they're making it, in my view, very difficult to get a deal with Iran. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=826.5s)]
*  Because Iran, apparently, from what the president said yesterday, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=831.5s)]
*  is more arrogant, more in your face than they've been before. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=836.5s)]
*  Because they watch our media. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=840.5s)]
*  They watch the Chatsworths. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=843.5s)]
*  They watch the others. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=845.5s)]
*  Some of the people in the White House who are undermining the security of Iran. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=846.5s)]
*  They watch the others. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=851.7s)]
*  Some of the people in the White House who are undermining the president of the United States. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=852.7s)]
*  They see it and they hear it. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=857.7s)]
*  And so they think that is a majority position of the United States [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=859.7s)]
*  when it is a tiny minority position of these reprobates and malcontents and miscreants. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=864.7s)]
*  Now, it's not a complicated issue. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=871.7s)]
*  Under no circumstances should Iran get a nuclear weapon. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=875.7s)]
*  It's the Trump position, the MAGA position, the Reaganite position, the Rhino position, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=880.9000000000001s)]
*  the position of everybody who has two brain cells to rub together. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=885.9000000000001s)]
*  The debate is over whether you can trust an Islamic terrorist regime [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=890.9000000000001s)]
*  that has already lied its way through multiple administrations, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=896.9000000000001s)]
*  that has signed numerous documents with the UN, with Europe, with anybody they want. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=899.9000000000001s)]
*  And yet here we are at the eleventh hour. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=905.9000000000001s)]
*  And then we're told it's not the eleventh hour. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=908.1s)]
*  There's some question about the intelligence, says Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=912.1s)]
*  But Tulsi Gabbard is the only one. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=916.1s)]
*  The IAEA says we're on the precipice. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=920.1s)]
*  The Austrian intelligence says we're on the precipice. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=924.1s)]
*  Our own head of, I'm trying to find it, Central Command [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=929.1s)]
*  says they're on the precipice, that they can have nuclear material in one week if they sprint to it. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=936.3000000000001s)]
*  He just testified to that today. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=941.3000000000001s)]
*  The Israelis say they're on the precipice and they have the most to lose [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=945.3000000000001s)]
*  if there is in fact a military campaign. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=948.3000000000001s)]
*  But Politico says there's some kind of question about this. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=953.3000000000001s)]
*  Now, I know who's leaking. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=961.3000000000001s)]
*  There was a big article in the New York Times a couple of years ago about Chasworth Osborne Jr. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=963.5s)]
*  He's been in Washington his entire life. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=969.5s)]
*  He's worked the system his entire life. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=972.5s)]
*  He's got all kinds of media at the Washington Post, at Politico and everything. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=975.5s)]
*  Rails against the left, but he uses the left and they use him. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=979.5s)]
*  I don't have any of these contacts. I don't talk to any of these people. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=983.5s)]
*  If I put him into a lie detector test right now and asked him one media outlet to the other, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=987.7s)]
*  he'd flunk if he lied. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=993.7s)]
*  So that's the difference. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=996.7s)]
*  I tell you the truth. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=998.7s)]
*  I'm not working through any media. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1000.7s)]
*  I'm not undermining the president. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1002.7s)]
*  I'm not lobbying the president. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1004.7s)]
*  I give my opinion if I'm asked [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1006.7s)]
*  and of course I'm paid to give my opinion here and on TV and on Blaze. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1008.7s)]
*  It's that simple. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1012.7s)]
*  My views are almost, almost completely in line with the president. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1014.9000000000001s)]
*  Almost. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1022.9000000000001s)]
*  I'm not changing his views. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1024.9s)]
*  I'm not making his views. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1026.9s)]
*  I don't treat him that way. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1028.9s)]
*  Now I know who the leakers are. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1032.9s)]
*  Just a matter of time. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1034.9s)]
*  In remarks at a Monday Business Roundtable, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1036.9s)]
*  President Trump made clear that the Iranian proposals thus far were unacceptable. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1039.9s)]
*  Quote, they're asking for things you can't do, Trump said. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1044.1000000000001s)]
*  They don't want to give up, but they have to give up. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1047.1000000000001s)]
*  They seek enrichment. We can't have enrichment. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1050.1000000000001s)]
*  We want just the opposite. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1052.1000000000001s)]
*  And so far they're not there. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1054.1000000000001s)]
*  None of this appeared in the Politico piece. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1056.1000000000001s)]
*  None of it. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1058.1000000000001s)]
*  I didn't say this. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1060.1000000000001s)]
*  I didn't urge the president to say it. He said it. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1062.1000000000001s)]
*  He said it. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1064.1000000000001s)]
*  All the leaking to Axios [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1066.1000000000001s)]
*  and the leaking to Politico [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1068.1000000000001s)]
*  and the leaking to... [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1070.1000000000001s)]
*  It's the isolationists who are doing it. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1072.1s)]
*  It's them. They're doing it. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1076.1s)]
*  They're trying to undermine the president. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1078.1s)]
*  And what they're actually doing, America, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1080.1s)]
*  is they're making his job [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1082.1s)]
*  a thousand times more difficult [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1084.1s)]
*  for the reasons I said. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1086.1s)]
*  The Islamo-Nazi regime in Tehran watches them, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1088.1s)]
*  listens to them. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1090.1s)]
*  Here's what they're saying and they say, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1092.1s)]
*  oh wow, this influencer, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1094.1s)]
*  he has no problem with it. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1096.1s)]
*  This person in the administration, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1098.1s)]
*  he has no problem with it. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1100.1s)]
*  And so they are emboldened. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1102.1s)]
*  They're emboldened. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1106.1s)]
*  So last week, I'm not going to tell you [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1110.1s)]
*  everything that was discussed. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1112.1s)]
*  I had a meeting with the president at his request. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1114.1s)]
*  It's leaked to the media. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1116.1s)]
*  And then they put a spin on it. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1118.1s)]
*  Levin is lobbing Trump on the war. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1120.1s)]
*  He asked my opinion, I gave my opinion. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1124.1s)]
*  It's the same opinion I've given to you [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1126.1s)]
*  day in and day out. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1128.1s)]
*  Same opinion I've given on Fox, day in and day out. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1130.1s)]
*  Same opinion I've given on Blaze, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1132.1s)]
*  day in and day out. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1134.1s)]
*  And there's no surprise by anybody for anything. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1136.1s)]
*  I'm not lobbing for anybody. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1138.1s)]
*  I'm not lobbing for a group of people. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1140.1s)]
*  And yet this is [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1142.1s)]
*  what these dishonest reprobates [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1144.1s)]
*  want you to believe. Why? Because they're desperate. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1146.1s)]
*  They're the ones who have ties to Qatar. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1152.1s)]
*  They're the ones who have ties to Putin. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1154.1s)]
*  They're the ones who have ties to all these bizarre, evil regimes. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1156.1s)]
*  They're the ones who are mouthpieces. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1162.1s)]
*  The special pleaders for the enemy. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1164.1s)]
*  Not me. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1166.1s)]
*  I was raised properly. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1168.1s)]
*  I know who the good guys are and the bad guys are. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1170.1s)]
*  I'm not a former Democrat [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1174.1s)]
*  who's now in the administration [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1178.1s)]
*  attacking in her own way [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1182.1s)]
*  the brave men [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1184.1s)]
*  who had to drop atomic bombs on Japan [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1186.1s)]
*  to end what could have been a forever war [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1190.1s)]
*  or where we might have lost up to a million soldiers. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1192.1s)]
*  This is sick. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1198.1s)]
*  Sick. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1200.1s)]
*  In my humble opinion. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1202.1s)]
*  I'm not a hawk. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1204.1s)]
*  I'm a realist. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1206.1s)]
*  A realist. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1208.1s)]
*  Foreign policy is about prudence. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1210.1s)]
*  It's not about hawks and doves. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1212.1s)]
*  It's not about ideology. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1214.1s)]
*  This is what Rachel Bade is literally too stupid to understand. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1216.1s)]
*  I've written about it [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1220.1s)]
*  in Liberty and Tyranny. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1222.1s)]
*  I've explained it over and over on this program. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1224.1s)]
*  She doesn't know me. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1226.1s)]
*  She doesn't listen to this show. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1228.1s)]
*  She doesn't watch Fox. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1230.1s)]
*  No. She's planted. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1232.1s)]
*  This information is planted to her by Chatsworth and the others [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1234.1s)]
*  and she runs with it. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1236.1s)]
*  She also works for ABC News. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1238.1s)]
*  So she works for two media organizations [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1240.1s)]
*  that have serious questions of credibility. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1244.1s)]
*  An influential group of GOP hawks [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1248.1s)]
*  has launched a behind the scenes [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1250.1s)]
*  lobbying offensive [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1252.1s)]
*  pressing President Donald Trump [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1254.1s)]
*  not only to back off his administration's [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1256.1s)]
*  quest for a nuclear deal with Iran [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1258.1s)]
*  but green light and attack on Tehran by Israel. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1260.1s)]
*  When did I get to the point [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1262.1s)]
*  where I was going to be a hawk [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1264.1s)]
*  and attack on Tehran by Israel? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1266.1s)]
*  When did I do that? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1268.1s)]
*  A lobbying offensive [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1274.1s)]
*  an influential group of GOP hawks [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1276.1s)]
*  who am I working with? [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1278.1s)]
*  The campaign is raising alarms among Trump [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1284.1s)]
*  and his allies. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1286.1s)]
*  Among Trump and his allies [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1288.1s)]
*  did they even talk to the President? [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1290.1s)]
*  He would have laughed at them. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1292.1s)]
*  By the way, at the end of the call [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1296.1s)]
*  he invited my wife and me [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1298.1s)]
*  to have dinner at the White House in the next month or two [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1300.1s)]
*  and if I said, you know, that's funny [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1302.1s)]
*  because if I do that [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1304.1s)]
*  it will be more the lobbying campaign [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1306.1s)]
*  by the hawks on Iran! [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1308.1s)]
*  And he laughed. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1310.1s)]
*  And I won't tell you what word he used [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1312.1s)]
*  he said, but don't worry about that. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1314.1s)]
*  I'm not worried about it. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1316.1s)]
*  During a private lunch, writes Rachel Bade [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1320.1s)]
*  and Felicia Schwartz [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1322.1s)]
*  with the President at the White House [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1324.1s)]
*  last Wednesday, conservative talk show host [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1326.1s)]
*  Mark Levin told Trump [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1328.1s)]
*  that Iran was days away from building [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1330.1s)]
*  a nuclear weapon. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1332.1s)]
*  Have I said that here, Mr. Producer? [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1334.1s)]
*  Have I said it on TV, Mr. Producer? [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1336.1s)]
*  An argument, Trump's own intelligence team [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1340.1s)]
*  has told the President is not accurate. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1342.1s)]
*  Yet his military advisors [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1344.1s)]
*  apparently are telling them it is accurate. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1346.1s)]
*  And so is his CIA. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1348.1s)]
*  So who are these intelligence advisors? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1350.1s)]
*  We know who. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1352.1s)]
*  According to an intelligence official [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1354.1s)]
*  I counted five anonymous sources [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1356.1s)]
*  in her article. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1358.1s)]
*  Not one of them would go on the record. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1360.1s)]
*  Not one of them had the courage to go on the record. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1362.1s)]
*  Not a damn one. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1364.1s)]
*  So here's Rachel Bade [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1366.1s)]
*  a fraud, a liar [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1368.1s)]
*  who goes with five anonymous sources [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1370.1s)]
*  lies about me [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1372.1s)]
*  and my relationship [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1374.1s)]
*  with the President [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1376.1s)]
*  and the whole story is about how the war hawks [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1378.1s)]
*  are lobbying the President [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1380.1s)]
*  and we're not, certainly I'm not [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1382.1s)]
*  and then the isolationist [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1386.1s)]
*  she doesn't call them isolationists [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1388.1s)]
*  she doesn't call them any [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1390.1s)]
*  progeratives, nothing [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1392.1s)]
*  it's all one way, the five anonymous [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1394.1s)]
*  sources [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1396.1s)]
*  and she goes on. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1398.1s)]
*  On a separate front [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1402.1s)]
*  MAGA loyalists have been warily eyeing [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1404.1s)]
*  Rupert Murdoch's papers, particularly [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1406.1s)]
*  the New York Post. Ah, see this is the giveaway [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1408.1s)]
*  Chatsworth [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1410.1s)]
*  whatever [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1412.1s)]
*  the hate for Fox [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1414.1s)]
*  the vid won't take your crap [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1416.1s)]
*  he doesn't like bullies, more than happy to engage [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1418.1s)]
*  with you. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1420.1s)]
*  They're trying to push the President [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1424.1s)]
*  to make a decision that's not what he wants [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1426.1s)]
*  a senior administration official [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1428.1s)]
*  told Politico [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1430.1s)]
*  off the record of course [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1432.1s)]
*  now that's one of two people [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1434.1s)]
*  I know, I know who they are [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1436.1s)]
*  this person like the others in the story [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1438.1s)]
*  was granted anonymity to speak freely [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1440.1s)]
*  wow [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1442.1s)]
*  they're amazing [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1444.1s)]
*  and to spread their lies [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1446.1s)]
*  that's why they spoke [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1448.1s)]
*  anonymously [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1450.1s)]
*  so Rachel Bade [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1452.1s)]
*  we tried to get her on this program [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1454.1s)]
*  to discuss her story [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1456.1s)]
*  we asked her twice, didn't you Mr. Producer? [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1458.1s)]
*  and she ignored you [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1460.1s)]
*  she ignored you [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1462.1s)]
*  she does commentary for ABC News [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1464.1s)]
*  she's the Washington writer [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1466.1s)]
*  for Politico [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1468.1s)]
*  but she ignored Mr. Producer [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=1470.1s)]

*  I think it was on Sunday [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2384.1s)]
*  the days start to meld together [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2386.1s)]
*  was about Thomas Jefferson and John Adams [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2388.1s)]
*  and I did an explanation of that here [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2390.1s)]
*  on the radio program as well [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2392.1s)]
*  about how these two men [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2394.1s)]
*  became friends [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2396.1s)]
*  and how they were able to get along [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2398.1s)]
*  and how they were able to get along [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2400.1s)]
*  and how they were able to get along [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2402.1s)]
*  and how they were able to get along [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2404.1s)]
*  about how these two men became fast friends [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2406.1s)]
*  then how they [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2410.1s)]
*  they turned against each other [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2412.1s)]
*  in very brutal ways [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2414.1s)]
*  and then [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2416.1s)]
*  for twelve years they wouldn't speak to each other [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2418.1s)]
*  and [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2422.1s)]
*  Adams reached out at the urging of [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2424.1s)]
*  Dr. Benjamin Rush [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2426.1s)]
*  another delegate [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2430.1s)]
*  in the past [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2432.1s)]
*  of the Constitutional Convention [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2434.1s)]
*  and he [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2436.1s)]
*  wrote a short note to Jefferson [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2438.1s)]
*  and Jefferson happily embraced it [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2440.1s)]
*  and I discussed this story [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2444.1s)]
*  and the president watches [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2446.1s)]
*  my shows [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2448.1s)]
*  apparently must those too [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2450.1s)]
*  I hope so [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2452.1s)]
*  as millions of people do [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2454.1s)]
*  and so we have this piece in USA Today [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2456.1s)]
*  and this came out [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2458.1s)]
*  just about an hour ago [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2460.1s)]
*  Elon Musk called Donald Trump [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2462.1s)]
*  before expressing regret for harsh [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2464.1s)]
*  attacks [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2466.1s)]
*  and my suggestion at the end of the program [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2468.1s)]
*  Mr. Producer was that Elon Musk pick up the phone [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2470.1s)]
*  call Donald Trump [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2472.1s)]
*  and really make amends [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2474.1s)]
*  because he started it [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2476.1s)]
*  and no I didn't tell [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2478.1s)]
*  Donald Trump about it [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2480.1s)]
*  Elon Musk reached out [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2482.1s)]
*  and talked privately to President Donald Trump [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2484.1s)]
*  by phone before the billionaire entrepreneur [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2486.1s)]
*  and former White House advisor expressed regret [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2488.1s)]
*  publicly for his harsh personal attacks [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2490.1s)]
*  on the president [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2492.1s)]
*  so here's another leak out of the White House [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2494.1s)]
*  by the way but Reuters confirmed [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2496.1s)]
*  the June 10 evening phone call [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2498.1s)]
*  citing a White House source with knowledge [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2500.1s)]
*  of the matter after the New York Times [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2502.1s)]
*  first reported the exchange [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2504.1s)]
*  marked the first time the Tesla [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2506.1s)]
*  and SpaceX CEO and Trump have spoken [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2508.1s)]
*  since their lines shattered during an [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2510.1s)]
*  epic feud last week [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2512.1s)]
*  at least didn't last 12 years right Mr. Producer? [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2514.1s)]
*  Hours after talking to Trump [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2516.1s)]
*  Musk apologized for inflammatory social media posts [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2518.1s)]
*  he directed at Trump [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2520.1s)]
*  when the two men went back and forth [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2522.1s)]
*  last week in their combative war words [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2524.1s)]
*  quote I regret some of my posts [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2526.1s)]
*  about President Trump [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2528.1s)]
*  last week they went too far [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2530.1s)]
*  the White House would not confirm [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2532.1s)]
*  or deny Musk's call to Trump [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2534.1s)]
*  nor should they because this is a leak [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2536.1s)]
*  and it goes on [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2538.1s)]
*  to regurgitate some of his [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2540.1s)]
*  some of his posts [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2542.1s)]
*  because you know the media want the fights [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2544.1s)]
*  they want the fights they want the grift [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2546.1s)]
*  they want the hits that's what they want [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2548.1s)]
*  that's all they have they don't have news [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2550.1s)]
*  they don't have news [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2552.1s)]
*  and so [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2554.1s)]
*  I happen to think this is a good thing [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2556.1s)]
*  I happen to think it's a good thing [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2558.1s)]
*  Elon Musk has [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2560.1s)]
*  has done a great deal for the country [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2562.1s)]
*  as an entrepreneur [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2564.1s)]
*  did a great deal for the campaign [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2566.1s)]
*  he's done a great deal [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2568.1s)]
*  when it comes to a government bloat [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2570.1s)]
*  he's taken a lot of hits left and right [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2572.1s)]
*  I don't know what happened [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2574.1s)]
*  but it doesn't matter [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2576.1s)]
*  he's taken the step to do [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2578.1s)]
*  what John Adams did and he should do [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2580.1s)]
*  and Donald Trump [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2582.1s)]
*  should not have apologized or called first [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2584.1s)]
*  because he didn't do anything [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2586.1s)]
*  but [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2588.1s)]
*  I think his reaction has been good [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2590.1s)]
*  and as I said [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2592.1s)]

*  he's a very forgiving man [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2596.1s)]
*  just look around him [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2598.1s)]
*  look around him people have been [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2600.1s)]
*  look around him people have said some horrific things about him [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2602.1s)]
*  I don't mean just criticism [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2604.1s)]
*  or supported another candidate [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2606.1s)]
*  I mean have said the worst of the worst [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2608.1s)]
*  and he's appointed several of them [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2610.1s)]
*  into his administration [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2612.1s)]
*  and one of them can't stop calling him [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2614.1s)]
*  right, Katarzyn? [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2616.1s)]
*  and they've said horrendous things about him [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2618.1s)]
*  horrendous [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2620.1s)]
*  again it's one thing in a primary [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2622.1s)]
*  to support another candidate and so forth [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2624.1s)]
*  that's not what I'm talking about [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2626.1s)]
*  that's not what I'm talking about [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2628.1s)]
*  that's not what I'm talking about [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2630.1s)]
*  let's get down to some other business here [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2632.1s)]
*  they're rioters [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2634.1s)]
*  and they're supporters [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2636.1s)]
*  now before I get into a fulsome explanation [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2640.1s)]
*  of what's going on here [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2642.1s)]
*  beyond some of the surface level discussions [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2644.1s)]
*  I want you to listen to this guy Chuck Hagel [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2648.1s)]
*  he was a Republican Senator from Nebraska [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2650.1s)]
*  a very strange man [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2652.1s)]
*  he's the former [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2654.1s)]
*  Obama Secretary of Defense [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2656.1s)]
*  he has spent years [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2658.1s)]
*  trashing Trump, years trashing Republicans [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2660.1s)]
*  very strange guy [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2666.1s)]
*  and listen to his take [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2668.1s)]
*  and you know, here's the thing [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2670.1s)]
*  why would CBS Evening News go to Chuck Hagel? [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2672.1s)]
*  how do they even know where to find him? [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2674.1s)]
*  you talk about an old man [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2678.1s)]
*  he's got to be in his 90s I guess [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2680.1s)]
*  late 80s [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2682.1s)]
*  and there's nothing wrong with that by the way, Katarzyn [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2684.1s)]
*  Katarzyn, you could be in your 50s [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2686.1s)]
*  and have the mind of a [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2688.1s)]
*  you know [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2690.1s)]
*  of an imbecile [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2692.1s)]
*  he's 78 [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2694.1s)]
*  I apologize [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2696.1s)]
*  but here he is [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2698.1s)]
*  and egged on by CBS Evening News [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2700.1s)]
*  although they don't have to egg him on much [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2702.1s)]
*  hat tipped news busters, cut three go [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2704.1s)]
*  what would be your biggest concern then about [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2706.1s)]
*  having National Guard [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2708.1s)]
*  and Marines deployed [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2710.1s)]
*  in large American cities? [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2712.1s)]
*  there's so many different kinds of life [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2714.1s)]
*  like we saw in 1970 [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2716.1s)]
*  1970 at Kent State [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2718.1s)]
*  it Kent State [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2720.1s)]
*  when the National Guard opened up on students [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2722.1s)]
*  and killed students [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2724.1s)]
*  partly because they weren't trained [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2726.1s)]
*  they panicked [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2728.1s)]
*  when they hear the President say [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2730.1s)]
*  if there are protests I'm going to send troops in other cities [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2732.1s)]
*  or to other places [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2734.1s)]
*  how would officers likely be reacting when they hear that? [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2736.1s)]
*  you know stop a minute [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2738.1s)]
*  this is so disgusting and disgraceful [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2740.1s)]
*  truly is disgusting and disgraceful. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2742.1s)]
*  It sounds like this was all planned. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2746.4s)]
*  Kent State in 1970. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2748.52s)]
*  Kent State doesn't come immediately to mind and most people does to me just because I'm [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2750.2s)]
*  a nerd on this stuff. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2753.4s)]
*  But nonetheless, and then they're asking him to project how would officers respond to this? [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2754.54s)]
*  Is this news America? [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2762.88s)]
*  Is this news? [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2764.16s)]
*  No, it's not news. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2765.16s)]
*  It's not even close to news. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2766.16s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2769.72s)]
*  Our top leadership will have, if this continues, is am I going to get to the point where I [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2771.48s)]
*  may have to refuse a direct order to send in or give troops authority to do whatever. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2777.9599999999996s)]
*  And I would think even contemplating defying an order from the commander in chief is a [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2785.12s)]
*  nightmare scenario for most officers. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2790.9399999999996s)]
*  Sure, contemplating a scenario like that is a career ending decision. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2793.52s)]
*  So they're talking about exactly nothing that's taking place, Mr. Producer. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2799.24s)]
*  Zero. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2804.24s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2805.24s)]
*  Speculating. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2806.24s)]
*  Always to the detriment of Donald Trump and the country. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2809.24s)]
*  Just speculating. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2812.8799999999997s)]

*  A pseudo-event. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2821.16s)]
*  CBS News has substantial resources. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2824.16s)]
*  Are they going to look into who's been funding this stuff? [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2826.2799999999997s)]

*  Jew haters on our college campuses? [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2834.7599999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2837.2799999999997s)]
*  Other organizations have done it, and I've brought that to you as well. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2838.2799999999997s)]
*  Funny, isn't it? [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2841.56s)]

*  Sounds like the free Palestine crowd, doesn't it, Mr. Badoos? [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2989.58s)]
*  So these people claim to be the indigenous peoples. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=2998.34s)]
*  They're not the indigenous peoples. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3000.94s)]
*  They're not the indigenous peoples. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3006.14s)]

*  So you see, you citizens of the United States, especially you white citizens of the United [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3015.08s)]
*  States whose ancestry is European, but not just you, anybody else who's here, who's not [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3019.7999999999997s)]

*  Get out of our country. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3034.44s)]
*  Sound familiar? [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3035.68s)]
*  Israel? [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3036.68s)]
*  I think it does. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3037.68s)]
*  But that's what they're saying. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3038.68s)]
*  So this isn't just about Donald Trump and his policies. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3041.22s)]
*  These people believe they have an absolute right to be here. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3047.74s)]
*  Period. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3052.4599999999996s)]

*  Period. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3058.4599999999996s)]
*  These are revolutionaries. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3059.66s)]
*  Now the media will mostly show you, now the two media sources I cite here, Willie Nelson [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3062.1s)]
*  TV on X, Nick Shirley on X, these are small independents, individuals. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3066.7s)]
*  But the corporate media, I saw on MSLSD with Pasaki, they're going to all the sob stories [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3073.8999999999996s)]
*  where families, their fathers taken overseas, excuse me, sent back overseas and this one [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3083.2999999999997s)]
*  and that one and you hear their stories. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3088.3999999999996s)]
*  They spend more time on that than they do on the criminals and what they're doing to [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3090.2s)]
*  American citizens. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3097.9199999999996s)]
*  Let me remind everybody, immigration is about what the American citizen wants, not what [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3099.3999999999996s)]
*  the foreign alien wants or demands. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3106.48s)]

*  citizen. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3116.6s)]
*  Our representatives are supposed to represent you and me. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3117.88s)]
*  In the cities, the representatives represent foreigners, illegal aliens and others. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3121.88s)]
*  And they get voted in over and over again, over and over again because of the Marxist [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3129.32s)]
*  ideology, because of the Democrat identification and people go in, they vote Democrat and these [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3135.0s)]
*  representatives represent them, yes, but illegal aliens. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3142.8s)]
*  And it's also their effort to change society. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3148.96s)]
*  The New York Times gave it away a few months ago. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3153.04s)]

*  They know exactly what they're doing. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3162.0s)]
*  They know exactly and that's what they're doing. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3164.52s)]
*  So nothing I've said is white supremacist. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3167.36s)]
*  Nothing I've said is racist. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3169.78s)]
*  It's the truth. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3171.26s)]
*  It is reality. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3172.26s)]
*  From all the little, all the little bastards over there at MediaEight and other places, [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3175.1000000000004s)]

*  Do you see these Democrats? [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3201.8s)]
*  This guy, Padilla, is a United States Senator in California. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3204.76s)]
*  He barges into a press conference. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3209.5600000000004s)]
*  How physical they get. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3212.0800000000004s)]
*  Like at the Newark Detention Center, the ICE detention center, the Democrats barge their [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3214.9s)]
*  They're physical. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3220.34s)]
*  They're abusive. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3221.34s)]
*  We're going to have a whole new generation of Democrats. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3222.34s)]
*  I don't mean necessarily young, but necessarily violent. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3226.86s)]

*  But it's incredible, America. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3258.64s)]
*  You understand the elected Democrats are violent like their constituents. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3263.4399999999996s)]

*  They look like a bunch of homeless people. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3276.68s)]

*  Now they're threatening if they take the House, they're going to gut ICE. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3285.58s)]
*  So this is a Marxist party, as I've told you multiple times, that represents Islamists [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3290.8599999999997s)]
*  and anti-Semites. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3295.58s)]

*  We have that here, don't we? [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3485.48s)]
*  Some of it anyway. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3487.94s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3490.94s)]
*  Rips her to shreds. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3493.46s)]
*  Now one thing at a time here. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3496.94s)]
*  One thing at a time. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3498.82s)]
*  So the problem here is that the Democrats reflect their violent base and the violent [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3502.78s)]
*  base reflects the Democrats. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3506.94s)]
*  And the violent base represents the judges, too. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3511.18s)]
*  I would ask the judges in Washington, D.C., are you okay with this judge in New Jersey [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3513.82s)]
*  who says Mahmoud Khalil can't be deported based on the Secretary of State's determination? [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3518.9s)]

*  I mean, even though he was involved multiple times as a leader of what turned out to be [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3527.78s)]
*  very violent activities at Columbia, and of course Reuters has said that he was a student, [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3531.7400000000002s)]
*  he wasn't a student any longer. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3539.26s)]

*  I love it when they bark. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3543.02s)]

*  The problem is when they don't bark. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3546.78s)]
*  Then you get a problem. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3549.3s)]
*  This was just too good, folks. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3551.34s)]
*  So we're going to listen in on some of this because most of you are working during the [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3553.82s)]
*  day as those who aren't listening to this program. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3557.2200000000003s)]
*  But I want you to hear some of this. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3563.34s)]
*  I want you to hear Elise Stefanik at a hearing on sanctuary states, sanctuary states. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3564.5s)]
*  And she lets into Kathy Hochul, the current governor, who she hopes to run against. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3569.86s)]
*  And I hope she does because she would be a fantastic governor. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3575.98s)]
*  This is Stefanik. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3581.54s)]
*  Cut 10, go. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3582.82s)]
*  Governor Hochul, on your first day in office, you signed executive order one. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3584.38s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3588.34s)]
*  I believe it is. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3592.34s)]
*  And you extended this executive order not once, not twice, but three times. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3593.34s)]
*  Most recently, January 16th this year. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3598.2200000000003s)]
*  Is that correct? [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3600.2200000000003s)]
*  If that's what your facts show, I signed countless executive orders. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3601.2200000000003s)]
*  I would assume you'd know it's executive order one. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3605.42s)]
*  And this is a continuation of your predecessor sanctuary state policies, correct? [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3607.86s)]
*  Is included in that. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3612.3s)]
*  I want to be sure we are defining sanctuary state properly. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3613.86s)]
*  I'll define it for you. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3616.6200000000003s)]
*  It is the policy of the state that state officers or employees shall not disclose information [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3617.6200000000003s)]
*  to federal immigration authorities for the purpose of federal civil immigration enforcement. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3622.42s)]
*  It goes on to say, law enforcement officers may not use resources, equipment, or personnel [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3626.9s)]
*  for the purpose of detecting and apprehending any individual suspected or wanted for violating [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3632.1800000000003s)]
*  a civil immigration office. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3637.46s)]
*  Law enforcement officers have no authority in the state of New York to take any policy [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3639.1s)]
*  action solely because the person is an undocumented alien. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3643.66s)]
*  That's a quote in your executive orders that you extended. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3647.06s)]
*  Now, do you know who Sakir Akan is? [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3649.78s)]
*  I want to get back to the first part of your question. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=3653.02s)]

*  Mr. Hernandez is not there. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYdfwKh7vB8&t=4037.7000000000003s)]
