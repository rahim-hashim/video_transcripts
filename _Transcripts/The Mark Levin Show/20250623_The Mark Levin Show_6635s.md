Video Description: On Monday’s Mark Levin Show, President Trump announced a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran, ending a 12-day war. What will it be about this agreement to ensure they don’t violate it? Iran should face unconditional surrender due to its weakened military and lack of support from allies like China, Russia, or Arab nations. Trump's decisive military actions prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, which no other president, including Clinton, Obama, or Biden, was willing or able to accomplish.  Without Trump's intervention, Iran would have become a nuclear power, potentially arming groups like the Houthis and enabling terrorist sleeper cells in the U.S. to acquire dirty bombs. Also, Trump’s actions on Iran have ensured peace for a period. But there’s a group of individuals—Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene, Matt Gaetz, and others—who are undermining Trump and aligning with radical left ideologies, including anti-Israel sentiments. These figures, supported by liberal media, aim to sabotage Trump’s movement and the next election. Later, Marc Thiessen calls in to discuss a Reagan Institute poll showing that MAGA Republicans strongly support U.S. global leadership, rejecting isolationism. The poll indicates 90% of MAGA voters prioritize preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, aligning with Trump's decision to join Israel's strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities. The claims of a splintering MAGA base over Trump's Iran policy are exaggerated, as isolationist critics represent a small minority within the GOP. Finally, Lee Smith calls in and discusses how Trump's political opponents, particularly within the Democratic Party and aligned institutions, have pursued strategies aimed at humbling America to counter his influence. These efforts stem from a belief that Trump's "Make America Great Again" rhetoric and policies threaten their vision of a globalized, progressive world order.

# Trump’s Legacy: A Strong Stand Against Nuclear Threats
**The Mark Levin Show:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo)
*  Ladies and gentlemen, this next segment of the podcast is brought to you by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=0.0s)]
*  For over 50 years, the Great Heritage Foundation has been America's outpost in Washington, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4.8s)]
*  fighting against the D.C. federal bureaucracy and working to secure a future that allows Americans [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=9.52s)]
*  to live the good life. For too long, common sense principles have been ignored by many of the very [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=14.64s)]
*  leaders claiming to fight for America, but the Heritage Foundation is proud to hold our leaders [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=19.28s)]
*  accountable and stand up for America's founding principles, paid for by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=23.6s)]
*  He's here. Now, broadcasting from the underground command post, deep in the bowels of a hidden [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=30.48s)]
*  bunker, somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=38.0s)]
*  we once again make contact with our leader, Mark LeVein. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  I'm going to read what President Trump just posted here. I'd assume this is accurate. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=120.88s)]
*  Congratulations to everyone. It has been fully agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=130.88s)]
*  will be a complete and total ceasefire in approximately six hours from now when Israel and Iran [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=135.68s)]
*  Iran have wound down and completed their in progress final missions for 12 hours, at which [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=142.4s)]
*  point the war will be considered ended. Officially, Iran will start the ceasefire and upon the 12th [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=150.88s)]
*  hour Israel will start the ceasefire and upon the 24th hour an official end of the 12-day war will be [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=156.72s)]
*  saluted by the world. During each ceasefire, the other side will remain peaceful and respectful. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=164.16s)]
*  When the assumption that everything works as it should, which it will, I would like to congratulate [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=169.6s)]
*  both countries, Israel and Iran, on having the stamina, courage, and intelligence to end what [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=174.56s)]
*  should be called the 12-day war. This is a war that could have gone on for years and destroyed the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=180.48s)]
*  entire Middle East, but it didn't. It never will. God bless Israel. God bless Iran. God bless the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=186.79999999999998s)]
*  Middle East. God bless the United States of America and God bless the world. Donald J. Trump, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=192.95999999999998s)]
*  President of the United States. This is what he's just posted, so I'm reading it raw. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=198.4s)]
*  Could be very interesting. Very interesting. You know folks, we're going to talk about what's [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=205.12s)]
*  taking place here in 12, for 12 days and over the weekend, our fantastic military commander-in-chief. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=211.84s)]
*  Why we could talk about this, because it's very, very important. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=220.0s)]
*  But it's also important that we understand that there is a crazed bunch of truly sick people [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=222.96s)]
*  who seek to steal the movement from Donald Trump and you, the 77 million people who voted for him. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=230.32s)]
*  And the radical left media are promoting them and pushing them and telling us they're consistent [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=236.48s)]
*  and they're principled when they're not mocking them, calling them names, and laughing at them. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=242.24s)]
*  And laughing at them. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=249.28s)]
*  You see, they don't want us to win the next election. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=253.20000000000002s)]
*  They don't want us to win the next election, so they're going to promote these people. There's [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=258.16s)]
*  a guy, Colby Hall, at Media. I told you he's a coward. We wanted to have a chat with him [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=262.08s)]
*  based on the last sleazy thing he wrote, but he wouldn't. It's okay. So he's telling us today, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=268.40000000000003s)]
*  yeah, this March we tell her Greene is bat-ass crazy, but she's the most principled among MAGA. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=274.88s)]
*  See what I mean? All these radical left sites and news organizations, it's not just her. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=281.52s)]
*  But you look at the background of these people and the things that they've said, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=291.28s)]
*  that no American was killed by Iran, that was her latest five watt light bulb comment. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=295.6s)]
*  Few years ago, she basically denied the Holocaust, then she had to apologize. This [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=303.6s)]
*  is a very sick woman. Not just another pretty face, I might add. And here I don't stop. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=308.40000000000003s)]
*  I don't stop. You got this guy, Matt Gaetz. I didn't know a lot about Matt Gaetz. He's a [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=317.76000000000005s)]
*  good debater. He was very good in these committees. Then I made the mistake of looking at that report [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=321.76000000000005s)]
*  that was released about this guy, Mr. Producer. He's a certified pervert. It's unbelievable. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=328.48s)]
*  Now I'm not going to post it. You can go do all your Google work all you want. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=338.64000000000004s)]
*  Then you get a guy who calls his podcast The War Room and calls everybody else a warmonger. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=344.24s)]
*  I remember when he joined the conservative movement from Hollywood. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=351.52000000000004s)]
*  Yes, a blunderbuss. Now his fantastic career is also all over the internet for you to [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=354.96s)]
*  investigate yourselves, if you care. I'm not only going to spend a few minutes on it, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=366.23999999999995s)]
*  whether it's charities and his pleading of guilt. And he thinks that Fox, Hannity, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=371.28s)]
*  Kayleigh McEnany, who's now taken leave to have baby girl, and I, among others, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=379.28000000000003s)]
*  should be investigated because we support Israel. So I'm publicly calling for his investigation [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=383.84000000000003s)]
*  based on his relationship with Communist China. Go ahead, look it up. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=391.04s)]
*  You'd think he'd be a little bit more supportive of Donald Trump at a time like this, given the [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=398.56s)]
*  support of Donald Trump at a time like this, given the fact that Trump pardoned his ass, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=404.47999999999996s)]
*  and it's a big ass. But no. Then you have Qatarlson out there. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=409.11999999999995s)]
*  You know what he did today, Mr. Producer? He praised Qatar. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=416.88s)]
*  Praise Qatar. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=420.24s)]
*  The Israelis have defeated the Iranian army, destroyed it, destroyed their Air Force, their [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=428.64s)]
*  Navy, destroyed the whole damn thing, took out all of their senior officials, military, all of them, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=434.40000000000003s)]
*  their senior intelligence officials, their top nuclear scientists. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=442.72s)]
*  We took out, permanently, I hope, the nuclear sites for which we praise and support Donald Trump [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=447.04s)]
*  and what he's done. While the people I just mentioned were trashing Donald Trump [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=454.48s)]
*  at a time when he deserved our support, because they don't have faith in him. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=460.8s)]
*  Now they interview each other and they post each other's interviews, and there's really quite a [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=468.64s)]
*  small following, quite frankly. And the radical left media love it. They sit there, they aggregate, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=472.64000000000004s)]
*  they put up hysterical headlines because they want their clicks and all the rest of it. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=477.92s)]
*  We keep it real here. Real here. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=482.8s)]
*  Making sure the Islamo-Nazi terrorist regime in Iran doesn't have nuclear weapons was a priority. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=487.76s)]
*  And the President of the United States took care of that. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=496.64000000000004s)]
*  That's a big deal. It is a huge deal. It'll be remembered forever, as long as it holds. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=499.68s)]
*  All the lies about a regional war, it's amazing. Virtually every Arab country today has denounced [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=508.64s)]
*  Iran because of the phony, the phony reputation-saving, quote unquote, firing of missiles. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=514.88s)]
*  That we, the United States, the Israelis, the Iranians, and others, agreed that they should do. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=524.24s)]
*  Crazy, isn't it? It's amazing. None of this would be happening, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=532.64s)]
*  but for the Israelis and Donald Trump. None of this would be happening, but for Netanyahu [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=537.92s)]
*  and Donald Trump. None of it. Now these people I just mentioned, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=541.4399999999999s)]
*  they have the same belief system as Talib when it comes to these issues. The same belief system [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=547.04s)]
*  as Omar when it comes to these issues. The same belief system is the most radical, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=552.3199999999999s)]
*  leftist, Marxist, Islamist elements in our country. The blame of America first crowd. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=560.16s)]
*  The blame of America's first crowd. The blame of America's first crowd. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=566.88s)]
*  Right? And the blame of the Jews and Israel crowd. And it's the biggest, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=570.96s)]
*  dearly nearest Marxist Islamist elements in our country. The blame of America first crowd. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=575.36s)]
*  The blame of the Jews and Israel crowd. And it Israel and Donald Trump and the [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=581.92s)]
*  greatest fighting force on the face of the earth, the United States military, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=588.88s)]
*  has ensured, at least for a period of time, peace [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=593.6s)]
*  Regardless of the people I just mentioned, what I call the Iran supporters, regardless [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=596.6s)]
*  of the media that plays them, in order to undermine our president, and in hopes of destroying [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=612.88s)]
*  us in the next election. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=621.62s)]
*  It's funny when you look at who your allies and supporters are. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=624.36s)]
*  For the reprobates I just mentioned, it's the most radical elements in the Democrat [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=628.8000000000001s)]
*  Party and the most radical ideologues in the country. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=633.36s)]
*  Not to mention the liberal media and their entrails like media. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=638.5600000000001s)]
*  That's the truth. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=645.28s)]
*  They didn't elect Donald Trump. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=648.1600000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump elected Donald Trump. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=649.44s)]
*  You elected Donald Trump. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=651.2s)]
*  That's the truth too. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=654.84s)]
*  So ever cease fire. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=657.58s)]
*  I hate this word cease fire. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=659.76s)]
*  I really do. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=661.0400000000001s)]
*  The president hated it a few days ago too. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=662.0400000000001s)]
*  What's needed now is this in my humble opinion. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=665.2s)]
*  Iran should be forced to sign a surrender document, unconditional surrender. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=670.5200000000001s)]
*  They lost their nukes. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=677.9200000000001s)]
*  They've lost their air force. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=678.96s)]
*  They have no ground to air protection. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=680.14s)]
*  China didn't step in. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=683.1s)]
*  Russia didn't step in. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=684.14s)]
*  Not a single Arab country stepped in. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=685.22s)]
*  The supreme Nazi is hiding in a bunker much like Adolf Hitler did. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=690.22s)]
*  Adolf Hitler wasn't thrown a lifeline. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=695.78s)]
*  He wasn't thrown a lifeline. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=700.6999999999999s)]
*  He was going to be killed, so he committed suicide. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=703.9s)]
*  I'm very much interested in seeing how this plays out. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=709.74s)]
*  I really am. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=712.78s)]
*  Because what does an agreement look like? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=717.22s)]
*  Does that mean the supreme Nazi survives? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=720.94s)]
*  Does that mean the regime survives? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=726.46s)]
*  I guess so. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=727.94s)]
*  If you understand the Islamist mindset, most of the people who talk do not. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=733.8s)]
*  The nitwitery have no idea about the Islamist mindset. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=744.24s)]
*  The war room. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=752.4399999999999s)]
*  You know, he actually reminds me of that guy in deliverance. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=753.4399999999999s)]
*  Who was that guy in deliverance? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=757.88s)]
*  Beydi. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=758.88s)]
*  What was his name? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=759.88s)]
*  Can you Google that while I'm talking to you, Mr. Producer? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=762.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=764.68s)]
*  Let's look that up. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=765.68s)]
*  That's who he really reminds me of. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=766.68s)]
*  Except his hair is longer. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=770.2s)]
*  You know, he looks like a hippie. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=771.2s)]
*  But nonetheless. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=772.2s)]
*  Nonetheless, while he's picking on Kayleigh McEnany, who's in that suite, who's a sweetheart, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=773.2s)]
*  because he doesn't like her opinion. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=781.4s)]
*  Marjorie Teller-Green has to be one of the dumbest people to ever serve in the House [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=786.28s)]
*  of Representatives. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=790.68s)]
*  The stupidity that comes out of that woman's mouth is hard to imagine. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=791.88s)]
*  Iranians didn't kill any Americans. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=797.72s)]
*  Just stupid. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=801.4399999999999s)]
*  Which is why they want to promote her. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=803.12s)]
*  Or Katarelson on a day like this. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=805.12s)]
*  Shouldn't he be praising the President and the Prime Minister of Israel for what they've [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=807.56s)]
*  achieved? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=810.88s)]
*  No, he praises Qatar. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=811.88s)]
*  Hence his name, Katarelson. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=812.88s)]
*  Then we have Matt Gaetz. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=817.28s)]
*  Who's really destroyed his career, destroyed himself. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=820.4s)]
*  But what do you expect? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=824.0s)]
*  No wonder he didn't want that report to come out. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=825.0s)]
*  This guy is officially certified one of the biggest perverts. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=827.12s)]
*  In my humble opinion, just my opinion. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=831.9599999999999s)]
*  I went back and looked. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=834.48s)]
*  Holy mackerel. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=836.92s)]
*  Wow. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=839.92s)]
*  Just a very strange group. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=843.04s)]
*  Great piece by Rich Lowry. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=845.9s)]
*  A national review by this guy, Dave Smith. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=847.5s)]
*  A comic. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=850.98s)]
*  Check that out. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=852.98s)]
*  So they're there. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=857.42s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=858.42s)]
*  There are millions and millions of you. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=859.42s)]
*  There are hundreds, if not thousands, of brilliant writers and commentators who lay out the case [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=864.78s)]
*  in the Constitution for our own country's national security, for border security. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=871.74s)]
*  I bring them to you often, whether it's on this program, on television or on Blaze. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=879.38s)]
*  Rational people, not grifters, not sloganeers, morons and worse. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=884.98s)]
*  That's what we do here. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=894.14s)]
*  We don't call our show the War Room. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=896.6s)]
*  The War Room. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=900.66s)]
*  We don't praise Qatar today. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=903.66s)]
*  We praise the American military and our Commander in Chief and our allies, the Prime Minister [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=905.9s)]
*  of Israel and the Israeli military. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=911.2199999999999s)]
*  A fantastic alliance that has achieved an enormous, enormous amount in 12 days. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=915.42s)]
*  You know who knows this? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=922.78s)]
*  President Trump. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=924.5s)]
*  He knows this. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=926.38s)]
*  Much more. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=929.06s)]
*  I'll be right back. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=930.06s)]
*  President Trump is in Washington with a mandate from the American people to solve the border [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=938.7399999999999s)]
*  crisis, reverse the effects of Bidenflation and restore American greatness. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=942.68s)]
*  But since January 20, judges across our country have consistently been blocking President [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=947.06s)]
*  Trump's attempts to fulfill his mandate. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=952.38s)]
*  The Heritage Foundation has been analyzing the situation and they've been able to identify [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=954.5s)]
*  the legal issues with these judges' actions as well as the solutions that can end this [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=959.34s)]
*  potential crisis. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=964.18s)]

*  So we have a ceasefire. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1006.9000000000001s)]
*  The different elements. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1009.34s)]
*  I was watching JD Vanson with Bret Baer. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1010.74s)]
*  He was actually quite good, I thought. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1013.94s)]
*  And this was being discussed to the moment he came on television, apparently. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1018.62s)]
*  The president's been on the phone with many of these various mediators and these rallies [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1021.9s)]
*  and so forth and so on. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1027.04s)]
*  So I look forward to reading carefully what it is. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1030.06s)]
*  Here's my thinking. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1035.82s)]
*  Just my personal opinion. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1039.3799999999999s)]
*  I've said from day one, any agreement with this regime, they will violate. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1042.82s)]
*  So the crucial thing to me is, what will it be about this agreement, whatever it is, to [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1049.5s)]
*  ensure that they don't violate? [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1057.4199999999998s)]
*  And so that'll be key. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1060.1799999999998s)]
*  They don't have an agreement yet. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1063.8999999999999s)]
*  So if you have an opinion on what this agreement should do, now's the time to voice it. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1066.6s)]
*  Because there is no agreement, actually. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1071.02s)]
*  That said, the nuclear program has been destroyed. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1075.54s)]
*  Their military has been destroyed. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1082.06s)]
*  But they're going to survive. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1088.6599999999999s)]
*  I'm just curious if that's OK with this audience. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1092.06s)]
*  Just curious. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1097.34s)]
*  The so-called supreme leader who's a supreme Nazi, he lives, he survives. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1099.58s)]
*  He lives, he survives. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1107.26s)]
*  I wonder what War Room thinks about this. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1108.26s)]
*  It should be called Appeasement Room, as he blusters on and does what he does. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1110.58s)]
*  We don't care what Katarlsen thinks. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1119.42s)]
*  We know what he thinks. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1121.16s)]
*  But it'll be very important to see what this is, because, or if there is an agreement, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1122.8200000000002s)]
*  just to cease fire. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1129.98s)]
*  But I very definitely want to know, what is it? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1132.46s)]
*  How's it going to be enforced? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1138.54s)]
*  So in that respect, you're back to square one. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1142.6200000000001s)]
*  I'll be right back. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1144.8200000000002s)]

*  Now, if you're not concerned yet, you should be. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1155.18s)]

*  mandate from the American people, it is we the people who lose out. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1161.3400000000001s)]
*  Thankfully, the Heritage Foundation has the policy solutions to stop these threats to [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1165.3400000000001s)]

*  Clinton, Obama, and of course Biden, who funded the enemy. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1272.4s)]
*  Clinton refused to bomb the nuclear site in North Korea in 1996, so 2006 they came out [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1283.96s)]

*  So President Trump hadn't done what he did despite these countervailing pressures. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1300.5800000000002s)]
*  Iran would be a nuclear Iran. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1307.18s)]
*  I have no doubt that Houthis would have a nuclear weapon. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1309.5800000000002s)]
*  They talk about the sleeper cells in America. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1313.38s)]
*  Although sleeper cells have been here for years, they didn't just come here over the [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1317.18s)]
*  weekend. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1321.18s)]
*  I have no doubt they would have tried to get a dirty bomb. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1322.18s)]
*  Just think of all the possibilities, the ifs. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1327.14s)]
*  I hear people say, including some of my friends in broadcast, now let's see what the sleeper [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1331.5s)]
*  cells do. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1338.38s)]
*  Now let's see what they do to our military sites. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1339.38s)]
*  Now let's see. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1341.66s)]
*  They act like we don't have experience with this country. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1342.66s)]
*  They act like they're just as stupid as Marjorie Taylor Greene, who said Iran has never killed [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1345.42s)]
*  an American. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1350.02s)]
*  They've been killing and maiming and spreading terrorism. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1351.02s)]
*  They don't need a quote unquote reaction to what took place in order to keep doing it, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1358.5s)]
*  and they're going to keep doing it. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1362.5s)]
*  Look, whether it's Iran, whether it's Hamas, whether it's Hezbollah, the Muslim Brotherhood, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1364.1000000000001s)]
*  ISIS, Islamic Jihad, and the list goes on and on and on, they're not going to stop. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1372.82s)]
*  They're not going to stop. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1379.8999999999999s)]
*  Because they believe their faith, as perverse as their approach to their faith is, is to [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1383.7s)]
*  kill us. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1387.78s)]
*  That that's what God's mandate is. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1391.0s)]
*  So they kill Muslims who don't agree with them. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1395.6599999999999s)]
*  They kill Jews and Christians. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1397.8799999999999s)]
*  They don't care. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1400.1s)]
*  They kill the biggest gay people they particularly hate. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1401.1799999999998s)]
*  They hate us, America, and they're not going to stop. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1404.1799999999998s)]
*  Even if Iran were wiped out to face the earth, they're not going to stop. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1413.3799999999999s)]
*  I'm sorry to pour reality on us, but they're not. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1420.4599999999998s)]
*  Let me tell you what's not going to happen to prove my point. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1425.46s)]
*  We have terrorist working groups, local, state, federal law enforcement. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1431.46s)]
*  They're not going away. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1436.58s)]
*  TSA at the airports, it's not going away. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1437.58s)]
*  Terrorist units within virtually every metropolitan police department, certainly every federal [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1444.58s)]
*  law enforcement entity, they're not going away. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1450.26s)]
*  The fence around the White House isn't going away. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1454.58s)]
*  The bulletproof glass when the president speaks, that's not going away. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1459.58s)]
*  It's not going away. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1464.58s)]
*  Of course we have homegrown nut jobs. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1467.38s)]
*  But we also have terrorists. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1469.58s)]
*  They're not going away. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1474.6200000000001s)]
*  It's very, very important to understand this. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1475.6200000000001s)]
*  You can only do what you can do. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1480.7s)]
*  China is still a horrendous danger. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1484.58s)]
*  They're plotting, the communist Chinese are plotting, North Korea is plotting, and so [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1490.5s)]
*  many others. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1494.3799999999999s)]

*  North Korea is going to build more nukes. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1498.42s)]
*  China is going to continue to build up its military as it eyeballs Taiwan, islands off [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1501.54s)]
*  of Japan, Philippines, and beyond. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1506.42s)]
*  They're on both sides of the Panama Canal. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1511.9s)]
*  That's not a mistake. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1514.5s)]
*  They're militarizing the Arctic Circle. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1515.58s)]
*  That's not a mistake. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1517.42s)]
*  Their base is in the middle of Pacific, including in Saipan, where my great uncle fought. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1518.42s)]
*  That's not a mistake. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1524.9s)]
*  They're based on the west coast of Africa, facing our coast. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1525.9s)]
*  That's not a mistake. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1529.94s)]
*  These are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous entities. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1532.94s)]
*  So we can go around with the modern day peaceniks, even though some of them are fat and slovenly. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1535.54s)]
*  Even though some of them pretend to be ultra patriotic, even though they pretend to support [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1541.42s)]
*  our troops when they undermine our troops in a time of a battle like this. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1546.02s)]
*  They have the same voice, the same mindset, and we know this because of Tlaib and Omar [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1551.94s)]
*  and Bernie Sanders, with whom they've united, with whom they've united. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1557.5s)]

*  Very dangerous. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1776.74s)]
*  You have the Arab countries in the Middle East who have united against Iran tonight. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1781.74s)]

*  They were shot out of the sky. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1810.74s)]
*  The Qataris got a heads up. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1812.74s)]
*  The United States got a heads up. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1813.74s)]
*  And apparently the Israelis got a heads up. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1815.74s)]
*  So they get the safe face. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1817.74s)]
*  This is a regime. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1819.74s)]
*  A regime. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1824.74s)]
*  That is likely now to remain in place unless the Iranian people rise up. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1827.74s)]
*  Which is less likely, I think, at this point. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1831.74s)]
*  Less likely at this point. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1835.74s)]
*  That's my take on it. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1839.74s)]
*  There are people who will try and twist it and attack it. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1841.74s)]
*  Anytime you want to know what I say, you listen. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1844.74s)]
*  If you can't listen live, you go to our website, marklevinshow.com. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1847.74s)]
*  I think we have four years worth of archives there. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1853.22s)]
*  Four years. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1855.22s)]
*  I'll be right back. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1857.22s)]
*  Mark Levin. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1859.22s)]
*  President Trump is in Washington with a mandate from the American people to solve the border crisis, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1866.22s)]
*  reverse the effects of Bidenflation, and restore American greatness. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1871.22s)]
*  But since January 20, judges across our country have consistently been blocking President Trump's attempts to fulfill his mandate. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1875.22s)]
*  The Heritage Foundation has been analyzing the situation, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1882.7s)]
*  and they've been able to identify the legal issues with these judges' actions, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1885.7s)]
*  as well as the solutions that can end this potential crisis. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1889.7s)]
*  Now to see the results of the Heritage's analysis for yourself, [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1893.7s)]
*  go to heritage.org slash Levin, heritage.org slash levin. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1896.7s)]
*  There you'll gain exclusive access to the Heritage Foundation's guide to solving the problem of limiting President Trump's executive actions. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1901.7s)]
*  Copping these judges might be the only way to protect Americans and take back our nation. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1910.18s)]
*  So go to heritage.org slash Levin, that's heritage.org slash levin, and get your free copy today. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1914.18s)]
*  That's heritage.org slash Levin, paid for by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1921.18s)]
*  Again, I want to repeat, it's clear that if President Trump is not President, can you imagine? [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1932.18s)]
*  Kamala Harris? [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1936.18s)]
*  The Democrats are very upset that our President and our military have succeeded spectacularly, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1938.66s)]
*  even calling for impeachment. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1945.66s)]
*  I don't know who's sicker, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1950.66s)]
*  the fake Magica ball or the Democrats and their media. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1952.66s)]
*  And the Democrats, the media and the isolationists did everything they could to prevent [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1957.66s)]
*  the President from ordering our heroic military to take out those sites. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1963.14s)]
*  But he did. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1967.14s)]
*  They've done everything possible to smear and libel him and to smear and libel his partner and friend, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1969.14s)]
*  the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, and their military, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1975.14s)]
*  which effectively defeated the Iranian military in 48 hours and helped lay a path, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1979.14s)]
*  helped lay a path as the Joint Chiefs, four-star general pointed out, [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1985.14s)]
*  to help us with our bombers to take out those sites. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1992.6200000000001s)]
*  He did what no President did before. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=1997.6200000000001s)]
*  The entire free world should enthusiastically and openly thank the President. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2001.6200000000001s)]
*  The isolationists should apologize. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2005.6200000000001s)]
*  They should apologize, but they won't. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2009.6200000000001s)]
*  They're too stupid and they're grifters. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2011.6200000000001s)]
*  Europe can now come out of the closet. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2015.6200000000001s)]
*  The Arab countries can now stop their war words against Israel while praying the American-Israeli alliance succeeded. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2018.1s)]
*  We can all sleep a little easier. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2024.1s)]
*  President Trump is a historic and iconic figure. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2029.1s)]
*  You don't have to agree with everything he says or does. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2032.1s)]
*  We've talked about this before. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2035.1s)]
*  So if you disagree with something, that's perfectly fine. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2037.1s)]
*  But if your goal is to undermine him, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2041.1s)]
*  to smear him, to cripple him, to stab him in the back, that's quite a different thing. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2044.58s)]
*  This is why that little cabal will be forever remembered as detestable little putians. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2049.58s)]
*  Forever remembered. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2063.58s)]
*  We'll see what the ceasefire results in. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2066.58s)]
*  We'll talk about it on this program. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2070.58s)]
*  We'll see if there's some kind of deal. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2073.06s)]
*  I'd be very curious to see what that looks like, but who knows? [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2076.06s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2080.06s)]
*  What we have so far is that within 24 hours, fighting will stop. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2082.06s)]
*  Should be very interesting. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2089.06s)]
*  Whether the regime, the Islamonazi regime in Iran, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2092.06s)]
*  if it stops, will its proxy stop? [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2098.06s)]
*  The Houthis? [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2101.54s)]
*  Will its proxy stop Hezbollah? [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2102.54s)]
*  Will its proxy stop Hamas? [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2104.54s)]
*  Be very interesting. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2106.54s)]
*  Remember, we had a deal with the Houthis that they couldn't shoot at our planes anymore in our ships. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2109.54s)]
*  Remember that, Mr. Producer? [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2114.54s)]
*  But it excluded Israel. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2116.54s)]
*  That wasn't so good. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2120.54s)]
*  And so we'll be here to examine it, ask questions about it. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2123.54s)]
*  And hopefully, everywhere possible, support all the efforts that are taken. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2128.02s)]
*  But again, not to sabotage. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2138.02s)]
*  That's a different, that's a completely different issue. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2140.02s)]
*  This is my problem with the left, the Democrats, the media, and the isolationists. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2144.02s)]
*  They're saboteurs. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2148.02s)]
*  They're saboteurs. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2150.5s)]
*  Once you remember this day, they told you that there would be a regional war. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2152.5s)]
*  They lied. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2158.5s)]
*  They told you there would be World War III. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2159.5s)]
*  They lied. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2161.5s)]
*  That's what they told you. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2163.5s)]
*  And now they'll tell you that anytime we're hit by terrorists, doesn't matter who or where, [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2165.5s)]
*  that's a result of what President Trump and Israel did. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2169.5s)]
*  They're liars. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2173.5s)]
*  We were hit by terrorists before, a lot of them. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2175.5s)]
*  Think about 9-11, for God's sakes. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2177.98s)]
*  Long time before this. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2182.98s)]
*  Again, we're up against an enemy that does not share our values, that does not have our mindset. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2184.98s)]
*  Which is why we will continue to have our defenses in place militarily, law enforcement. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2195.98s)]
*  The border must remain secured. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2200.98s)]
*  And it will remain secured under this President. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2203.46s)]
*  All right. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2209.46s)]
*  Let me see here, Mr. Producer. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2210.46s)]
*  You just sent me something. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2212.46s)]
*  Let me do this. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2214.46s)]
*  By the way, can I say one other thing? [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2216.46s)]
*  I'm so proud of you folks in this audience. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2218.46s)]
*  I really am. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2220.46s)]
*  You don't live on the Internet, thank God. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2222.46s)]
*  You don't live in the comments sections, which I really read. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2224.46s)]
*  You're real Americans. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2228.46s)]
*  You have a life to lead. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2229.46s)]
*  You follow the law, you work hard and you pay your taxes, and you expect your government to defend you and protect you. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2231.94s)]
*  That's not irrational. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2235.94s)]
*  That's what the government's supposed to do. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2237.94s)]
*  And that's what it just did. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2239.94s)]
*  That's what it just did. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2241.94s)]
*  We all know that the regime could not have a nuclear weapon. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2243.94s)]
*  But finally we have somebody who put his foot down. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2247.94s)]
*  The problem is we actually had people in our country... [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2251.94s)]
*  We actually had people in our country who were opposed to stopping them. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2254.42s)]
*  Opposed to stopping them. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2256.42s)]
*  We'll never forget them. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2258.42s)]
*  Nor will I relent. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2260.42s)]
*  We will continue to expose them. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2262.42s)]
*  Whether they be in the Democrat Party, the media, or whether they be fake Mago or anybody else. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2264.42s)]
*  We got a lot going on, folks. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2268.42s)]
*  Come on, let's get this thing started. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2270.42s)]
*  Let's get this thing started. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2272.42s)]

*  And I'm a little concerned. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2350.86s)]
*  I mean, I'm reading that a senior Iranian official has confirmed that they're in for a ceasefire. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2354.86s)]
*  Then I read another report that another senior Iranian official says we never heard from the United States. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2360.86s)]
*  Either way, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2367.34s)]
*  you have the Israelis who've been fighting for almost two years, [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2369.34s)]
*  Iran, through its proxies and so forth. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2375.34s)]
*  They've had hostages murdered. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2377.34s)]
*  They're still hostages with Hamas. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2379.34s)]
*  You see what they did with Hezbollah. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2381.34s)]
*  The Houthis, we made a deal with the Houthis, [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2383.34s)]
*  but it didn't include the Israelis. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2385.34s)]
*  They've been taking ballistic missiles in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem and all around the country. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2387.34s)]
*  For a little country like that, they've lost a lot of their weapons. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2391.34s)]
*  They've lost a hell of a lot of IDF soldiers. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2395.82s)]
*  You have these brilliant tactics with Iran. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2399.82s)]
*  And they took out a lot of their radar systems and other things. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2401.82s)]
*  And they built a path, as the head of the Joint Chiefs mentioned, [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2405.82s)]
*  that in part allowed us to do what we did with the nuclear sites. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2409.82s)]
*  Where are we going with this? [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2413.82s)]
*  Well, I think the happiest person in the world, if Iran is not agreeing to peace, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2417.82s)]
*  because he's got free reign to do whatever he wants in Iran right now. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2422.3s)]
*  If the Iranians want to commit suicide, let them. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2428.3s)]
*  They have almost no air defenses. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2432.3s)]
*  They've taken out more than half of their ballistic missiles. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2434.3s)]
*  Their terror networks have been decimated. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2436.3s)]
*  The skies of Syria are being used to shoot down Iranian missiles [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2438.3s)]
*  instead of Syria being a transit way for weapons pipeline to terrorize terror proxies. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2442.3s)]
*  They just showed their total weakness by firing 14 missiles at Al Udeid [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2448.78s)]
*  and warning us ahead of time so we could shoot them down. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2454.78s)]
*  Because they wanted to have a symbolic strike to respond to what we did. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2456.78s)]
*  Let's try it a different way. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2462.78s)]
*  Let's say they say yes. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2464.78s)]
*  What do you want us to sign? [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2466.78s)]
*  Then what? [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2468.78s)]
*  I think that's where we're headed. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2470.78s)]
*  The outcome is inevitable. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2475.26s)]
*  The regime has a choice. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2479.26s)]
*  They're either going to stop fighting and stop attacking [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2481.26s)]
*  and agree to whatever the heck Donald Trump wants them to do [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2485.26s)]
*  or they're going to be decapitated. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2489.26s)]
*  Trump has said, what's wrong with regime change? [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2491.26s)]
*  Which is a wake up call to the isolationist right. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2497.26s)]
*  I'm happy to take them out if that's what they choose. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2501.7400000000002s)]
*  It's up to them. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2505.7400000000002s)]
*  My question is, what would a paper agreement look like? [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2507.7400000000002s)]
*  You have Hamas, you have Hezbollah, you have the Houthis. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2509.7400000000002s)]
*  How would they be part of this agreement? [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2515.7400000000002s)]
*  In other words, those are still entrails of the Islamist terror regime in Tehran, no? [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2517.7400000000002s)]
*  Whatever agreement it is, it's the surrender on the deck of the USS Missouri. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2523.7400000000002s)]
*  Complete and total surrender. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2530.22s)]
*  That's what Donald Trump wants. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2532.22s)]
*  That means no more support for terrorism, no more support, no more pursuing nuclear weapons, [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2534.22s)]
*  verifiable destruction of what's left of your enriched uranium. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2540.22s)]
*  They don't have any centrifuges anymore thanks to those brilliant B-1 pliers from [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2544.22s)]
*  Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2550.22s)]
*  The peaceful completion of the mission that was carried out on Saturday night. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2552.22s)]
*  Or we can just let Israel continue to pummel them until there's nothing left. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2558.7s)]
*  It's their choice. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2564.7s)]
*  I'm not sure I agree with your parallel on the Missouri. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2566.7s)]
*  I like it. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2568.7s)]
*  But it did take two atomic bombs. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2570.7s)]
*  You understand what I mean? [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2572.7s)]
*  You know what? [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2574.7s)]
*  We dropped 420 pounds of... [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2576.7s)]
*  But we did not drop it on Tehran, did we? [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2580.7s)]
*  No, we did not. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2584.7s)]
*  Okay, let's be honest about it. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2587.18s)]
*  All right, so that said, and we shouldn't, but it's a different circumstance. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2589.18s)]
*  Our enemy is the regime, not the people. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2595.18s)]
*  Now, what do you say to people who seem to be lying in wait, these isolations and others, [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2597.18s)]
*  if there's a terrorist attack on us and so forth, then they want to figure out a way to attach it to what's taking place? [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2603.18s)]
*  Let me ask you something. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2609.18s)]
*  Have there been terrorist attacks before Saturday night? [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2611.18s)]
*  Before Saturday night, except for Al-Qaeda on 9-11, no one had killed more Americans than the Iranian regime. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2615.66s)]
*  You go back to the Marine barracks bombing, to the bombings in Saudi Arabia, to the explosively... [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2621.66s)]
*  That person, Marjorie Taylor Greene, who said, I don't know any Americans who've been killed by Iran. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2631.66s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2637.66s)]
*  What a moron. I'm sorry. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2639.66s)]
*  She is a moron. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2641.66s)]
*  Iran has killed more. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2644.14s)]
*  The idea that we're getting dragged into a Middle Eastern war, Iran has been at war with us since 1979 when they took the hostages. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2646.14s)]
*  They've been at war with us. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2652.14s)]
*  We're just completing it. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2654.14s)]
*  And the other thing is this whole idea of a MAGA schism over this is such fake news. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2656.14s)]
*  The Reagan Institute poll came out and it showed 90% of self-described MAGA Republicans support the regime. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2664.14s)]
*  The other 10% of the Republicans support Donald Trump in ending Iran's nuclear program. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2672.62s)]
*  I bet you, Saturday night, the other 10% have come around. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2678.62s)]
*  The Tucker Carlson's of the world, the Marjorie Taylor Greene's of the world, if we still had phone booths, that's where they'd be meeting. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2682.62s)]
*  Except they don't have a place to meet anymore because there are no more phone booths. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2688.62s)]
*  It's so true. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2692.62s)]
*  And yet the media plays them up. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2694.62s)]
*  This group, MediaEye, The Independent, The Washington... [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2696.62s)]
*  They all call me. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2698.62s)]
*  Because they're loud. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2701.1s)]
*  They're loud. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2703.1s)]
*  Stomping their feet. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2705.1s)]
*  And by the way, Mark, it's not just... [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2707.1s)]
*  Go ahead, buddy. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2709.1s)]
*  I'm sorry. I let that go. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2711.1s)]
*  Do we lose? [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2713.1s)]
*  20% say we should be less engaged and react to events. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2715.1s)]
*  84% say the U.S. has a moral obligation to stand up for human rights and democracy wherever possible. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2719.1s)]
*  71% support responding to defend the NATO ally. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2725.1s)]
*  If they were attacked by Russia. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2730.58s)]
*  And also, I want to say... [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2732.58s)]
*  I don't have the number. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2734.58s)]
*  73% say that we should send military forces to defend Taiwan if it's attacked by China. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2736.58s)]
*  That's MAGA voters. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2742.58s)]
*  In fact, the MAGA Republicans are more hawkish and less isolationist than establishment Republicans who say they're not part of the MAGA movement. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2744.58s)]
*  And you wrote a brilliant column on this in the Washington Post today. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2752.58s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2756.58s)]
*  I resent subscribing to those damn people. That's just me. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2759.06s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, when you look at this, really, I mean, you got a guy like Bannon who calls his podcast the War Room. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2765.06s)]
*  Shouldn't he call it the appeasement room? [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2772.06s)]
*  And then you have Marjorie Teller-Green, me speaking, perhaps the lowest of the IQs up there, that the Iranians never killed Americans. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2774.06s)]
*  I mean, we literally have dead soldiers in our military cemeteries. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2785.54s)]
*  We have citizens. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2789.54s)]
*  We have people that come out of Georgia. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2791.54s)]
*  How reckless and ignorant is a statement like that? [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2793.54s)]
*  And then we have Katarlson today who praises Qatar. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2795.54s)]
*  Not Israel. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2800.54s)]
*  So the idea that these people... [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2802.54s)]
*  And I think, Mark Teason, this is why the media pushed these guys. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2804.54s)]
*  Because they want the world to think that they represent us. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2808.54s)]
*  They represent nobody. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2811.54s)]
*  They represent nobody. They don't represent the MAGA movement. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2814.02s)]
*  But they thought that Donald Trump was with them. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2817.02s)]
*  Because Donald Trump said that we're not going to get dragged. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2820.02s)]
*  Yeah, we have a big connection. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2825.02s)]
*  And so they thought that he was going to be one of them. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2827.02s)]
*  And the greatest joy of this whole Israeli campaign and now US-Israeli campaign, [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2831.02s)]
*  other than seeing the Iranian nuclear program going up in flames, is seeing the isolationist right go up in flames. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2836.02s)]
*  And discovering that Donald Trump is not an isolationist and neither is the MAGA movement. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2843.5s)]
*  And I don't know why that was ever hard to understand. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2849.5s)]
*  Because he was talking about taking out these nukes from day one. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2852.5s)]
*  I mean, he's been the most consistent and vocal about it. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2855.5s)]
*  And it's not like the Iranian regime was going to volunteer it. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2858.5s)]
*  So he played them out as long as he could. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2861.5s)]
*  But they were never going to say, you know what? You've convinced us. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2864.5s)]
*  After 40 years and hundreds of billions of dollars, [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2867.5s)]
*  wanting to blow up the United States and the Jews and other Muslims who don't agree with us. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2870.98s)]
*  You know what? You've convinced us. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2876.98s)]
*  And they were never going to do that. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2877.98s)]
*  So I think it was Trump who played them rather than they playing Trump, don't you think? [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2879.98s)]
*  Absolutely. And look, this is the guy who destroyed ISIS. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2882.98s)]
*  This is the guy who killed Qasem Soleimani. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2886.98s)]
*  This is the guy who launched a cyber attack on Russia to take out their troll farm in St. Petersburg [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2889.98s)]
*  that was interfering in our elections. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2893.98s)]
*  This is the guy who bombed Syria twice for using chemical weapons on its people. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2896.46s)]
*  This guy was never an isolationist. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2902.46s)]
*  He was peace and strength. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2905.46s)]
*  The reason why we didn't get dragged into any war in his first term is because everybody was afraid of him. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2907.46s)]
*  He didn't retreat from the world. He made our enemies retreat. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2914.46s)]
*  And you make a great point. I just want to emphasize it because I've been making it as well. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2917.46s)]
*  But your piece is very articulate, which is... [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2921.46s)]
*  MAGA is not divided. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2924.94s)]
*  The percentage of people who voted for Trump and identified with Make America Great Again, a Reagan term, [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2926.94s)]
*  were never these kooky isolationists that felt that under no circumstances do you ever use the United States military [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2932.94s)]
*  even to defend yourself against an Islamo-Nazi regime with nuclear weapons. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2940.94s)]
*  That's suicide, isn't it? [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2944.94s)]
*  Yeah, they're like rats on a ship. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2946.94s)]
*  They jumped on the MAGA ship and they hitched a ride, hoping that they would take them to where they wanted to go [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2950.42s)]
*  and they found out that there's an exterminator on board. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2956.42s)]
*  I do think it's very important, as excited as we are about all this, and we should be, [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2959.42s)]
*  to understand what this ceasefire means, to understand if there's going to be a deal later, [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2965.42s)]
*  given the mindset of these people. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2970.42s)]
*  It's not like the West in any respect. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2974.42s)]
*  It is very important that in their defeat, in their military defeat, [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2976.9s)]
*  because let's face it, the Israelis defeated their military in 48 hours. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2982.9s)]
*  I mean, now they're dealing with ballistic missiles, but they have nothing, zero. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2987.9s)]
*  And they had to defeat all their proxies, too, just about. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2991.9s)]
*  And of course, our magnificent Air Force, what they did, and Navy, and everybody else who was involved. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=2995.9s)]
*  We just had to make sure, because I know enough about history. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3001.9s)]
*  This isn't even about Donald Trump. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3005.38s)]
*  We just had to make sure that the quote unquote peace or the aftermath of this [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3007.38s)]
*  doesn't just put these people off for a generation where they're back. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3011.38s)]
*  See what I mean? [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3016.38s)]
*  Yeah, I agree with you 100%. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3017.38s)]
*  But he's right to try and get them a peaceful option out. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3019.38s)]
*  I'm old enough to remember, because like you, I served in the Reagan administration. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3022.38s)]
*  I was an intern in the last year of the Reagan administration. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3026.38s)]
*  There were a lot of conservatives who criticized Ronald Reagan for talking to Gorbachev. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3028.38s)]
*  Howard Phillips called him a useful idiot of Soviet communism. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3032.86s)]
*  And he ended up bringing down the Soviet Union. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3035.86s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with talking to your enemies. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3039.86s)]
*  The difference that Donald Trump faces from Ronald Reagan is that he doesn't have a Gorbachev. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3042.86s)]
*  He's got a Putin. He's got an Ayatollah Khamenei. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3046.86s)]
*  And they're not willing to do what Gorbachev was willing to do. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3049.86s)]
*  So you have to have an interlocutor. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3052.86s)]
*  But that doesn't mean you don't try. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3054.86s)]
*  You don't give them the option, because you never know what they're going to do. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3055.86s)]
*  But he's willing to. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3059.34s)]
*  He's not negotiating out of weakness. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3061.34s)]
*  He just backed it up with B-2 bombers. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3064.34s)]
*  He's negotiating out of strength. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3067.34s)]
*  And so God bless him. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3069.34s)]
*  You know, if he can get them to cry uncle or amo, as they say in Persian, is the Persian word for uncle, then good for him. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3070.34s)]
*  And if not, we can do it the hard way. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3077.34s)]
*  And maybe that's what he's about here. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3080.34s)]
*  Maybe he's saying, look, let's do this one more time, this dance. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3082.34s)]
*  And if they don't come along again, even if they sign something, they don't adhere to it. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3086.82s)]
*  And that's that. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3091.82s)]
*  It's the end of them. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3092.82s)]
*  Is that possible? [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3093.82s)]
*  It is possible. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3094.82s)]
*  And by the way, I would also remind everybody that this has echoes across the world. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3096.82s)]
*  Xi Jinping is watching this. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3101.82s)]
*  I think a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, the chances of that happening on Trump's watch have gone down dramatically. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3103.82s)]
*  I think Putin is going to be very careful now and maybe a little bit more chastened in his dealing with Ukraine when Donald Trump says stop bombing. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3111.3s)]
*  I think this is going to have an impact in other parts of the world. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3118.3s)]
*  North Korea, taking note. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3121.3s)]
*  He's made not just the Middle East, America safer. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3124.3s)]
*  He's not just made Israel safer. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3127.3s)]
*  He's made the whole world safer by what he's done. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3129.3s)]
*  You've done a great job, my friend. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3132.3s)]

*  Well, maybe she'd have an audience if she came on your show. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3150.78s)]
*  That'll never happen. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3155.78s)]

*  the Senate. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3281.06s)]
*  That's according to the Constitution. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3282.06s)]
*  It's not optional, Donald. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3284.18s)]
*  It's not. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3287.42s)]
*  The framers of the Constitution actually gave Congress the power to declare war for a reason [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3288.94s)]
*  So the American people, through their elected representatives, would have the opportunity [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3294.7799999999997s)]

*  You can read the Constitution. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3308.7s)]

*  Haven't we talked about forever wars, Mr. Bidus? [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3909.14s)]
*  So how do you end a forever war? [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3913.8199999999997s)]
*  You defeat the enemy once and for all. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3915.14s)]
*  Don't you? [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3917.46s)]
*  So suddenly, we have this. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3919.3s)]
*  I hope this plays out well. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3924.7400000000002s)]
*  It would be great for the world. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3926.2200000000003s)]
*  Trust me on this. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3927.78s)]
*  It would be great for the world. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3928.78s)]
*  I believe that. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3931.7s)]
*  So they bring Thomas Massie on Face the Nation. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3933.82s)]
*  Why do they bring him on? [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3936.06s)]
*  Why do they bring him on? [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3938.46s)]
*  He and maybe four, five, six others have a view that's similar to Tim Kaine, similar [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3939.46s)]
*  to Hakeem Jeffries, similar to the man on the moon. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3945.86s)]
*  And so this is how he gets on Face the Nation. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3950.6600000000003s)]
*  Why? [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3954.1s)]
*  Because they want him on Face the Nation to sabotage him. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3955.1s)]
*  Let me tell you something, America. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3957.78s)]
*  I've gotten calls from the Washington Post. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3959.82s)]
*  I've gotten calls from media outlets all over the world who want to quote from me. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3963.7400000000002s)]
*  Who want to quote from me? [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3971.5s)]
*  They've handed out my phone number, so I've had to block that. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3975.14s)]
*  Now, why do they want to quote from me? [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3981.3s)]
*  When I sit here, as I have for decades, and I talk about all sorts of things, hot issues, [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3984.94s)]
*  philosophy, economics, they don't want to quote from me. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3993.46s)]
*  Why do they want to quote from me now? [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3997.18s)]
*  You see, because they want to play this up, this divide and mega. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=3998.98s)]
*  They're not interested in what's really going on. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4003.86s)]
*  You heard Mark Thiessen, who's fantastic. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4007.42s)]
*  I've talked about this too. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4010.62s)]
*  This divide doesn't exist. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4011.96s)]
*  But they want it to exist. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4013.52s)]
*  And I am not going to contribute to their pseudo news and their ideological agenda. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4015.64s)]
*  I could talk to the Washington Post and blow out these reprobates. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4022.04s)]
*  In fact, I'd have a lot of fun doing it. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4026.82s)]
*  But I'm not going to let them use me in this program that way. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4028.62s)]
*  They're going to do it anyway. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4032.02s)]
*  But I'm not going to personally talk to them and contribute to it. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4033.66s)]
*  One of the reasons I wanted this guy, Colby Hall, who's a founding senior editor, [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4038.06s)]
*  or whatever he is, at Mediocre Eye, is to get him on here and ask him, [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4042.06s)]
*  what are you doing? [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4047.26s)]
*  What is your mission? [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4048.42s)]
*  How do you guys function? [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4049.14s)]
*  What is it that you're doing? [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4050.1s)]
*  What is your purpose? [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4051.02s)]
*  What's with these headlines? [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4052.62s)]
*  But he didn't want to come on. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4056.42s)]
*  So he trucks along without any challenge. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4059.02s)]
*  But I'm going to continue to challenge all of it. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4062.14s)]
*  All of it. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4065.2200000000003s)]
*  Here's Thomas Massey on Deface the Nation. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4067.5s)]
*  Margaret Brennan, who is horrendous, absolutely horrendous. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4071.7000000000003s)]
*  So you know when you're talking to Margaret Brennan where she's coming from. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4075.14s)]
*  Go ahead. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4078.38s)]
*  The Speaker of the House, who is from your own party, has really rejected this. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4080.06s)]
*  He says, the Article 1 power of Congress really allows for the president to do this. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4084.62s)]
*  It was a limited, necessary, targeted strike, he says. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4089.66s)]
*  Well, he's probably referring to the War Powers Act of 1973. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4093.9s)]
*  But that's been misinterpreted. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4097.7s)]
*  There were no imminent threat to the United States, [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4100.62s)]
*  which was what would authorize that. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4104.54s)]
*  And I think that's peculiar to hear that from the Speaker. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4106.26s)]
*  Excuse me, Tommy. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4109.18s)]
*  It was passed in 1973 over the veto of Richard Nixon. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4110.42s)]
*  And it was passed because people were angry about the Vietnam War. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4113.82s)]
*  That's right. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4117.9s)]
*  And he didn't have the votes. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4118.9s)]
*  They didn't have the votes to use the power of the purse to defund it until sometime later, [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4119.9s)]
*  and not much later, when Gerald Ford was president. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4125.219999999999s)]
*  They voted to defund no more monies for the Vietnam War, super majorities of both houses. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4130.04s)]
*  And that's how they ended the Vietnam War. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4136.0599999999995s)]
*  Not with a phony statute that attempts to amend the Constitution, violates [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4138.7s)]
*  separation of powers. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4143.22s)]
*  Let me ask you this, folks. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4144.5s)]
*  Forget about the name War Powers Act, the Constitution. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4145.9400000000005s)]
*  Forget about it all. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4148.52s)]
*  Do you think Congress, this Congress, that can't get a budget done, [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4149.52s)]
*  that is split right down the middle, that can't get us our tax cuts, [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4153.860000000001s)]
*  that before Trump couldn't secure the border, [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4158.5s)]
*  do you think that group of 535 members should be in charge of war? [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4161.02s)]
*  Well, that was actually discussed at the Constitutional Convention. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4169.18s)]
*  We know this because of Madison's notes. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4172.84s)]
*  And you know what they said? [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4174.24s)]
*  No! [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4175.72s)]
*  They created, in this new presidency, they created the Commander in Chief. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4176.72s)]
*  He's the head of the Army. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4182.56s)]
*  And they have the power of the purse. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4186.360000000001s)]
*  If you can get enough votes and get it over the veto of a president, you can cut off war. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4187.360000000001s)]
*  It's not even war he's talking about. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4191.88s)]
*  There's not a war. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4194.24s)]
*  What Donald Trump did was not, wasn't a war. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4195.860000000001s)]
*  If it was a war, it's the fastest World War III in human history. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4197.76s)]
*  It's not a war. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4202.56s)]
*  It's a military pinpointed operation. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4203.56s)]
*  The Israelis are fighting a ground war and an air war and a war period. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4208.080000000001s)]
*  We hit their nuclear sites, which is absolutely crucial. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4213.54s)]
*  So they wave around the War Powers Act. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4219.360000000001s)]
*  Let me ask you, do you think Congress should have the power to order a president to remove [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4221.400000000001s)]
*  troops from the field, Mr. Modus? [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4226.88s)]
*  Do you think they should have a power to order the president to stop a military engagement [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4230.2s)]
*  in the middle of an engagement, America? [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4234.84s)]
*  And not just affirmatively. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4236.96s)]
*  The way the statute is written is the president presents Congress with all this information [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4238.48s)]
*  and documents about what's going on. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4243.44s)]
*  And if Congress doesn't act on the documents by their inaction, he must pull the troops. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4245.599999999999s)]
*  You think that's a good idea, America? [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4252.36s)]
*  Do you think the framers of your constitution would have agreed to one damn syllable of [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4256.52s)]
*  that? [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4261.080000000001s)]
*  They had just fought a revolution, a revolution that actually began in 1775. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4262.080000000001s)]
*  And John Yoo, who's the expert on this, I am one too, but he's the man, said they didn't [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4271.080000000001s)]
*  issue a declaration called the Declaration of Independence until 1776. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4278.280000000001s)]
*  The Declaration of War Clause in the Constitution is not a declaration to make war. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4282.26s)]
*  You know how we know that? [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4287.16s)]
*  Because they changed the language at the Constitutional Convention from a declaration to make war [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4288.860000000001s)]
*  to a declaration to declare war, like the Declaration of Independence. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4295.14s)]
*  That was their experience. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4299.26s)]
*  The declaration to declare war is not what triggers a war response. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4303.42s)]
*  It is a statement of the body politic to declare war. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4310.34s)]
*  Not make war. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4318.360000000001s)]
*  You can only make war with the funding that Congress has provided you. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4320.6s)]
*  If Congress wants to withdraw the funding, it absolutely has the power to do it. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4324.06s)]
*  You know why they don't do that? [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4328.34s)]
*  Because they don't have the votes. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4330.54s)]
*  And let's say they did have the votes. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4333.54s)]
*  President has to sign it. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4335.7s)]
*  So he vetoes it. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4337.900000000001s)]
*  You think they have a supermajority? [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4339.02s)]
*  Of course not. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4340.42s)]
*  And so these reprobates who present themselves as the pure constitutional, they're liars. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4343.42s)]
*  They're damnable liars. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4349.660000000001s)]
*  I'll be right back. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4352.660000000001s)]
*  Pure Talk, my wireless company, a veteran led company, believes every man and woman who [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4361.660000000001s)]

*  That's why he said no. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4474.8s)]
*  I hadn't heard from him for a week. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4475.8s)]

*  Not right after. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4483.6s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4486.56s)]
*  It's a tough book, Mark. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4487.56s)]
*  I know what he meant. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4488.8s)]
*  This is a scholarly book. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4491.56s)]
*  It's a substantive book. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4493.2s)]

*  corners of the page down. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4503.42s)]

*  I have a very good friend who is a very famous columnist who's been reading it and said it's [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4512.799999999999s)]
*  absolutely a killer. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4516.599999999999s)]

*  his columns. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4524.879999999999s)]

*  a bad week for the isolationists. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4566.2s)]
*  He was talking about Tucker Carlson and he was talking about Steve Bannon. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4568.6s)]
*  Do you think? [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4572.6s)]
*  Boy, that hurts. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4573.6s)]
*  I had to be honest. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4574.6s)]
*  To have Mitch McConnell say that is not exactly what I'm looking for, Mr. Producer. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4575.6s)]
*  But it doesn't matter. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4581.84s)]

*  877-381-3811. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4678.34s)]
*  You know, the hostages are still being held, still being tortured and starved to death. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4683.34s)]
*  As if everybody's forgotten about them, Mr. Producer. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4694.34s)]
*  It would be nice if there was a footnote somewhere in the media, just somewhere reminding us [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4699.34s)]
*  of what the Iranians and Hamas have done and that these people are still there. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4705.34s)]
*  I mean, this war has been fought since October 7th by the Israelis. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4712.34s)]
*  Even when Biden was president, trying to undermine their great prime minister and their IDF, [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4717.34s)]
*  but they wouldn't allow themselves to be undermined, would they? [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4723.34s)]
*  Despite all the trash talk about Netanyahu, the president of the United States admires [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4727.34s)]
*  him and is a very close friend of his. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4733.34s)]
*  How do I know? [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4735.34s)]
*  Because the president told me. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4736.34s)]
*  And so when you have sperm whales like Bannon over there at the war room, tough guy, war room, [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4738.34s)]
*  really the appeasement room would be better. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4748.34s)]
*  Can we take a short break, Mr. Producer, even though this is real early? [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4752.34s)]
*  Is that possible? [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4756.34s)]
*  Can we do that? [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4758.34s)]
*  All right, I'll wait. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4760.34s)]
*  I'll wait and call this gentleman back. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4761.34s)]
*  Nobody. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4765.34s)]
*  You said we can't. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4766.34s)]
*  Well, I don't want to screw the audience out there and everybody else. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4768.34s)]
*  But I want you to know this. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4774.34s)]
*  This is ground zero for defending this president. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4776.34s)]
*  This is ground zero for fighting them on the War Powers Act. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4784.34s)]
*  And I remain open minded to what the president is doing. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4790.34s)]
*  Open minded, a skeptic, but open minded. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4793.34s)]
*  I'm being honest with you. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4797.34s)]
*  And I hope some of the things I'm raising will be taken into consideration. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4800.34s)]
*  You see the difference? [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4806.34s)]
*  He defied us. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4808.34s)]
*  He screwed us. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4809.34s)]
*  He stabbed us in the back. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4810.34s)]
*  I'm never going to support him again. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4811.34s)]
*  You didn't hear that out of my mouth. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4813.34s)]
*  Look, you know what's possible? [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4818.34s)]
*  You ready? [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4820.34s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4821.34s)]
*  He's like way up here. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4822.34s)]
*  I had my hand way up in the sky. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4824.34s)]
*  Way up here. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4826.34s)]
*  I think he can run circles around anybody and I don't exclude myself. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4830.34s)]
*  I think his mind is like 10 steps ahead of everybody. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4836.34s)]
*  And see, I accept that and I realize that and I admire it. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4842.34s)]
*  I certainly do. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4847.34s)]
*  I just want to make that abundantly clear. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4849.34s)]
*  And here's the other thing. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4852.34s)]
*  I trust the man. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4854.34s)]
*  Again, unlike the isolationists, I trust the man. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4859.34s)]
*  We have this guy Roe. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4866.34s)]
*  How do you pronounce it? [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4868.34s)]
*  Kana. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4869.34s)]
*  Kana, who pretends to be a moderate, actually went to temple law school as I did. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4870.34s)]
*  I don't know him. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4874.34s)]
*  He's younger. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4875.34s)]
*  Apparently he thought there were greener pastures in California. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4876.34s)]
*  And he's elected from there and he pretends to be a moderate. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4881.34s)]
*  He's a kook. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4883.34s)]
*  And so he's an see all the Democrats are lining up here. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4886.34s)]
*  Cut 10 go. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4891.34s)]
*  Well, first of all, the strikes were unconstitutional. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4893.34s)]
*  We can't just go bomb in other country in Iran without congressional authorization. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4896.34s)]
*  I hate to wake you up, Congressman, but yes, you can. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4902.34s)]
*  You actually can. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4906.34s)]
*  Now, people may not like it. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4907.34s)]
*  So trying to amend the Constitution. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4908.34s)]
*  Go ahead. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4911.34s)]
*  People may not like it, but it is what it is. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4912.34s)]
*  You know what people won't like if Congress is involved in decisions in making war, which the framers said no way. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4915.34s)]
*  And we're hit and we're hit and we're hit again. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4923.34s)]
*  And these a holes, maybe their own vacation or these a holes. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4925.34s)]
*  Maybe they're having an affair on the side, you know, or maybe they're paying for underage prostitutes like one of our great Republicans was. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4928.34s)]
*  Remember that Mr. Producer? [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4936.34s)]
*  Or they're not even prostitutes. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4937.34s)]
*  But anyway, it doesn't matter. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4938.34s)]
*  Very, very busy. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4940.34s)]
*  Maybe they're like Marjorie Taylor Greene. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4942.34s)]
*  Make sure you add an E to the end. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4945.34s)]
*  That offends her a lot. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4946.34s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene, who spends her life on the Internet. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4947.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4952.34s)]
*  But you can't you can't run a country that way. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4955.34s)]
*  And no president has agreed to that. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4957.34s)]
*  No court will agree to it. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4959.34s)]
*  These are phonies. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4960.34s)]
*  These are frauds. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4961.34s)]
*  So every one of these people you hear, whether they're a Democrat or Republican, we just had an incredibly successful military operation. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4962.34s)]
*  Extremely limited in scope, extraordinarily powerful in scope to stop an Islamic Nazi regime from getting nuclear weapons, which they were actually building and two weeks away from having. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4969.34s)]
*  And they talk about the War Powers Act and impeachment and that Trump isn't following the Constitution. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4981.34s)]
*  They're liars. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4987.34s)]
*  And they had their talking points. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4990.34s)]
*  They're liars. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4994.34s)]
*  Let him go to court. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4997.34s)]
*  Let him sue him. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=4999.34s)]
*  Go to the Supreme Court. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5000.34s)]
*  Say what they see what they say. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5001.34s)]
*  They won't use the power of the purse because they can't get enough votes. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5004.34s)]
*  They won't amend the Constitution because they can't get enough votes. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5007.34s)]
*  They're undermining our military. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5015.34s)]
*  Our military just carried this out and these guys are going, oh, what they were unconstitutional. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5018.34s)]
*  That's right. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5023.34s)]
*  You're rounding up illegal aliens. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5024.34s)]
*  Violent, illegal aliens. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5026.34s)]
*  Oh, he's a dictator. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5028.34s)]
*  That's illegal. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5029.34s)]
*  He can't use the National Guard. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5030.34s)]
*  He certainly can. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5032.34s)]
*  And he did. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5033.34s)]
*  And the court upheld it. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5034.34s)]
*  He got to get out of these lower courts. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5035.34s)]
*  Oh, you can't. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5040.34s)]
*  So you can't bring Islamo Nazi students. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5041.34s)]
*  We're not citizens. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5046.34s)]
*  You can't deport them. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5047.34s)]
*  Since when? [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5049.34s)]
*  Since when? [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5053.34s)]
*  Since when? [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5055.34s)]
*  You got this guy Garcia. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5057.34s)]
*  He beats his wife. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5058.34s)]
*  He's MS-13. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5059.34s)]
*  He's human trafficking. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5061.34s)]
*  You know what a federal Biden judge or magistrate just did? [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5062.34s)]
*  You must release him. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5066.34s)]
*  Insane. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5068.34s)]
*  So they believe Joe Biden can do anything he wants, even though he doesn't have his marbles. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5072.34s)]
*  He can defy Supreme Court rulings. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5077.34s)]
*  He can move hundreds of billions of dollars around. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5079.34s)]
*  He can shoot missiles. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5081.34s)]
*  But Donald Trump comes in, follows the Constitution, and this is what we get. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5085.34s)]
*  I'll be right back. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5091.34s)]
*  Mutt Blub-In. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5092.34s)]
*  We have our friend Lee Smith with us. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5108.34s)]
*  Truly one of the great writers and thinkers over there at Tablet and elsewhere. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5110.34s)]
*  Lee Smith, how are you, my friend? [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5114.34s)]
*  I'm doing very well, Mark. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5117.34s)]
*  Thanks so much for inviting me to speak with you tonight. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5118.34s)]
*  It's my pleasure. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5121.34s)]
*  You wrote a piece today in the Tablet. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5122.34s)]
*  I want you to explain to the American people why you wrote it and what your points are. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5126.34s)]
*  Well, I think the most important point to make is that the quasi-maga influencers, [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5133.34s)]
*  I don't know how else to describe them. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5139.34s)]
*  I know that you have many choice words for them, Mark. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5141.34s)]
*  Yes, and they deserve every damn one of them. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5144.34s)]
*  God, I'm sorry. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5146.34s)]
*  100%. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5147.34s)]
*  No, no, I agree. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5148.34s)]
*  The pseudo-maga influencers, what I say is it's just Barack Obama in a skin suit. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5150.34s)]
*  They're pushing for the exact same pro-Iran policies. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5156.34s)]
*  They're anti-Israel. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5160.34s)]
*  And I don't know if they understand the details of this policy, [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5162.34s)]
*  but what it is is it's an anti-America policy. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5167.34s)]
*  That's Iran's number one target. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5170.34s)]
*  We've been, as the greatest nation in the history of the world, [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5172.34s)]
*  we've been the major power in the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Gulf, [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5179.34s)]
*  or whatever you want to call it, since 1945 when FDR met with the founder of the modern Saudi state, Ibn Saud. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5183.34s)]
*  We have the arrangement has been for the United States to protect the oil that the Saudis pump. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5191.34s)]
*  That makes us the deciding power there. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5198.34s)]
*  What the Iranians want to do is drive us out. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5200.34s)]
*  They want to weaken and impoverish America. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5203.34s)]
*  That's a very big deal the way they see Israel. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5206.34s)]
*  No doubt it is the regime that today embodies anti-Semitism. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5209.34s)]
*  They hate Israel. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5215.34s)]
*  They hate Jews. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5216.34s)]
*  The big target, though, is to destroy, to weaken at least the United States, [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5217.34s)]
*  to push us out of the Gulf, to limit our ability to do anything. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5222.34s)]
*  They can commit terror attacks here. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5226.34s)]
*  They can close the Straits of Hormuz, as they've been threatening to. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5228.34s)]
*  They can't do that without the bomb. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5231.34s)]
*  But that's the real point, and that's what Obama was doing. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5233.34s)]
*  He wasn't just looking to hurt Israel. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5236.34s)]
*  He was looking to cripple the United States. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5238.34s)]
*  And that's what these pseudo-MAGA influencers are doing as well. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5241.34s)]
*  They're pushing the exact same policy as Barack Obama pushed. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5245.34s)]
*  Do you think this will ever catch up with them? [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5249.34s)]
*  I mean, I have to be honest with you. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5253.34s)]
*  I'm going to keep a light shine on these people. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5255.34s)]
*  The death to us part. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5257.34s)]
*  Because I think they're dangerous going forward. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5259.34s)]
*  They're dangerous in the midterm elections. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5262.34s)]
*  They're dangerous in the next presidential election because their ideology is, as you say, Barack Obama. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5264.34s)]
*  I mean, you're talking Bernie Sanders and Tlaib. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5269.34s)]
*  They sound exactly like each other, do they not? [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5272.34s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5274.34s)]
*  I think one difference is this. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5276.34s)]
*  I think the big difference is that these people are, I mean, we see them continue to go on social media and on their podcasts. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5278.34s)]
*  They continue to rip into President Trump and President Trump's policy in spite of the fact that Donald Trump has been usually successful in the attacks. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5286.34s)]
*  And not only in the US attacks, but his support of Israel, which is, you know, [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5298.34s)]
*  I mean, we saw Donald Trump speaking the other night on Saturday night after the attacks. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5303.34s)]
*  And he himself was virtually choked up about the partnership, the alliance between the US and Israel and getting important things done for the peace and prosperity of the United States and for Israel and for the security of the world. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5307.34s)]
*  So, I mean, these people, again, they continue to go after President Trump and they're going to keep doing it. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5324.34s)]
*  I don't see a way out of it. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5330.34s)]
*  And it struck me finally, they're happy with it because they're losers. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5331.34s)]
*  They're happy being on the losing side. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5335.34s)]
*  And what's most important for them is to have a platform to air their grievance, their self-pity and their resentment. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5337.34s)]
*  And we've had plenty of figures like this before in American politics, and many of them shared those views. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5344.34s)]
*  I think they're happy there. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5349.34s)]
*  So, no, I don't see any reversal. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5351.34s)]
*  And what's strange about this particular group is they actually have the history of the 1930s to look at. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5355.34s)]
*  You know, the people in the 1930s didn't have a whole lot of history to look at. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5364.34s)]
*  They had some, but they had the history to look at it. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5368.34s)]
*  And Charles Lindbergh, as bad as he was, he turned out to be quite honorable. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5371.34s)]
*  He apologized. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5375.34s)]
*  He was leading the war bond effort, things of that sort. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5377.34s)]
*  These people don't strike me as honorable, do they, you? [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5380.34s)]
*  No, they don't. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5383.34s)]
*  I mean, I think it's not just the issues in just Germany. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5384.34s)]
*  If you look at the countries, if you look at the societies who took the dive, who went into this obsessive Jew hatred, [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5387.34s)]
*  well, I mean, all Jew hatred is obsessive. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5398.34s)]
*  But if you look at them, we're talking about what? [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5401.34s)]
*  We're talking about 19th century Russia. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5404.34s)]
*  We're talking about 20th century Germany. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5405.34s)]
*  We're talking about the Arab states. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5407.34s)]
*  We're talking about the Islamic Republic of Iran. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5409.34s)]
*  None of these societies have any success. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5411.34s)]
*  All of these societies wind up as major losers. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5414.34s)]
*  And that's why I keep coming back to this idea that they're losers. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5418.34s)]
*  And that's where they're most comfortable losing. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5422.34s)]
*  I think that they probably misunderstood Donald Trump from the beginning. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5424.34s)]
*  I think they probably grafted their resentments onto him and believed that's who he was. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5428.34s)]
*  And they couldn't have been more wrong. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5435.34s)]
*  This is a man who loves America, who loves American strength and who loves winning. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5437.34s)]
*  Let's remember what Donald Trump said in 2015. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5442.34s)]
*  He wasn't talking about, yeah, no more wars, no endless wars. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5444.34s)]
*  He said, I'm tired of losing wars. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5449.34s)]
*  I'm tired of us losing trade deals. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5451.34s)]
*  I'm tired of us losing. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5453.34s)]
*  We're winners. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5454.34s)]
*  And that's Donald Trump's whole thing. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5455.34s)]
*  And you saw what happened. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5457.34s)]
*  We all saw what happened this weekend. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5458.34s)]
*  Donald Trump wants to win for America, and he wants to win for American allies. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5460.34s)]
*  And he chooses our alliances carefully. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5464.34s)]
*  He picks other winners like Benjamin Netanyahu and Ron Dermer. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5466.34s)]
*  Ambassador, Minister Dermer deserves an awful lot of credit too. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5471.34s)]
*  Donald Trump picks winners on behalf of the United States. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5475.34s)]
*  That's a great point. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5479.34s)]
*  He wants to win for America. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5481.34s)]
*  And he is a winner, right? [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5484.34s)]
*  I mean, can you imagine if Kamala Harris had been elected? [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5486.34s)]
*  What would it look like there? [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5489.34s)]
*  I mean, what would it look like? [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5491.34s)]
*  I mean, for sure, Iran would get nuclear weapons. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5492.34s)]
*  And for sure, this country would be much less safe than the rest of the world as well. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5495.34s)]
*  But you mention, and rightly so Obama, but on something this crucial, you know, [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5500.34s)]
*  they say we agree with Trump on everything but this. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5506.34s)]
*  But isn't but this like at the top of the list? [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5508.34s)]
*  That is the security of the nation from atomic, excuse me, from nuclear weapons? [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5511.34s)]
*  I mean, this to me is the other side of open borders. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5516.34s)]
*  I mean, it's the same thing. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5519.34s)]
*  If you let a regime, if you let an insane third world regime have nuclear weapons, [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5520.34s)]
*  it's the same thing as opening your borders to third world lunatics. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5527.34s)]
*  And that's what's happening. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5531.34s)]
*  It's part of the same thing. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5532.34s)]
*  And Donald Trump says, I love America. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5533.34s)]
*  I'm going to protect America. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5535.34s)]
*  If you're going to protect our borders, then you have to protect our interests. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5536.34s)]
*  As Donald Trump understands, protect our interests across the world too. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5539.34s)]
*  And that's what he's doing. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5543.34s)]
*  I mean, I don't understand what some of these folks think, [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5544.34s)]
*  that Donald Trump is going to, you know, that Donald Trump is going to survive [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5549.34s)]
*  the assassination attempt at Butler. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5553.34s)]
*  He was going to survive that to let Iran, to let Iran break out and build nuclear bombs. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5555.34s)]
*  I mean, it's absolutely nuts. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5562.34s)]
*  There's no indication that that was ever what Donald Trump was going to do. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5564.34s)]
*  All right, my friend. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5569.34s)]
*  If people want to find you or read this, where do they go? [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5570.34s)]
*  Right to tablet. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5575.34s)]
*  I believe it's on the front page. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5576.34s)]
*  And Mark, I hope you don't mind. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5577.34s)]
*  I'm going to take the opportunity. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5578.34s)]
*  You know, we have a we have a print magazine now at tablet, which is just a [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5580.34s)]
*  I love it. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5584.34s)]
*  I'm so glad. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5585.34s)]
*  And I hope that people will subscribe. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5587.34s)]
*  It's just a beautiful thing to hold in your hands. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5590.34s)]
*  And Mark, you know, with all the stuff that's going on, all the nuttiness that's going on online, [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5592.34s)]
*  I mean, tablet is going back to foundations. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5597.34s)]
*  It's a print publication. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5599.34s)]
*  We're still online as well. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5601.34s)]
*  I don't want people to get disheartened about that. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5602.34s)]
*  But and that's where I write. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5605.34s)]
*  I write a tablet. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5607.34s)]
*  I hope people will. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5608.34s)]
*  Tablet is a fantastic, fantastic site, whether online or you get the magazine in hand or both. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5609.34s)]
*  And it is a beautiful magazine. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5616.34s)]
*  Some of the smartest writers in the country, like Lee Smith, who you just heard, encourage you to grab it. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5618.34s)]
*  Lee, take care of yourself, brother. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5624.34s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5625.34s)]
*  At eight seven seven three eight one three eight one one. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5635.34s)]
*  You know, the funny thing here, Mr. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5639.34s)]
*  Bidus will tell you that. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5643.34s)]
*  Sometimes I'm writing things and I get disrupted and I post them without adding things that I mean to add. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5645.34s)]
*  Isn't that right, Rich? [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5655.34s)]
*  I'll say, what the hell? [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5656.34s)]
*  It's just that you're doing so many things and distractions and so forth. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5658.34s)]
*  But I want to make something clear here. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5666.34s)]
*  I just added it to my post if I can find the damn thing. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5668.34s)]
*  Stick with me, America. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5671.34s)]
*  Stick with me. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5672.34s)]
*  I'm talking to you. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5673.34s)]
*  I don't care about the media. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5674.34s)]
*  Here's my post. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5678.34s)]
*  The enemy whose military has been defeated by the Israelis and whose nuclear program has been destroyed by our president and military. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5679.34s)]
*  Survives, at least for now. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5687.34s)]
*  We shall see how things unfold. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5689.34s)]
*  Now I've been and remain highly skeptical of deals. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5691.34s)]
*  Made with terrorists who have a half century record of killing Americans, Israelis and anyone else in their way and refused to voluntarily abandon their nuclear weapons, lying and deceiving every step of the way. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5696.34s)]
*  Perhaps this is another POTUS strategy. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5708.34s)]
*  Perhaps POTUS believes this will smoke them out. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5711.34s)]
*  And if they do not adhere to the ceasefire terms or some agreement, then all bets are off. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5713.34s)]
*  They've already been smoked out and will and will whatever is agreed to include their proxies. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5718.34s)]
*  Will Russia stop supplying ground air missile defense systems? [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5725.34s)]
*  Will China stop selling the regime fuel for their ballistic missiles? [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5729.34s)]
*  Will they stop building ballistic missiles? [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5733.34s)]
*  My prediction based on all this and more is that the terrorist regime's belief system and mindset will not be changed at all. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5735.34s)]
*  Just its tactics, maybe. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5741.34s)]
*  And again, we shall see how this plays out. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5743.34s)]
*  And now I've added to be absolutely clear, as I didn't finish my post, that President Trump is to be trusted. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5747.34s)]
*  He wants to win for America. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5757.34s)]
*  And his record is stellar. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5759.34s)]
*  I also trust that issues I mentioned here will be part of the process. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5761.34s)]
*  Plus Prime Minister Netanyahu has signed on. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5765.34s)]
*  I mean, that's a big deal, don't you think, Rich? [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5768.34s)]
*  Let's see how it goes. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5771.34s)]
*  I'm rooting for them. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5774.34s)]
*  So just to be crystal clear. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5775.34s)]
*  Let's see here. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5777.34s)]
*  There's something else I wanted to read to you. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5781.34s)]
*  Oh, here it is. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5786.34s)]
*  I think. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5788.34s)]
*  Stick with me, folks. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5790.34s)]
*  All right. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5794.34s)]
*  There we have it. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5795.34s)]
*  There have been conflicting reports. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5796.34s)]
*  A senior Iranian official has said, yes, it's true. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5799.34s)]
*  A senior Iranian official, I think, told CNN, but one of the reprobate outfits, that it's not correct. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5803.34s)]
*  I've checked. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5808.34s)]
*  It is correct. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5809.34s)]
*  That, in fact, this is where they are. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5812.34s)]
*  Now, look, anything can change in 10 minutes. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5817.34s)]
*  All right. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5820.34s)]
*  Anything can change in 10 minutes. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5822.34s)]
*  I think they know that. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5824.34s)]
*  I think the Israelis know it. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5825.34s)]
*  The president knows it and so forth. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5826.34s)]
*  But it is true that this is out there. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5830.34s)]
*  It is true that the Iranians want to deal. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5835.34s)]
*  It is true that the Israelis said, OK, let's see what it looks like and that the president is the maestro. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5838.34s)]
*  And so in that post, I've raised a number of issues that I think are very pertinent and that I hope will be taken into consideration. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5846.34s)]
*  But then again, we're talking about a remarkable man, this president. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5854.34s)]
*  That's what I wanted to emphasize. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5860.34s)]
*  And that's why I wrote what I wrote, as well as the fact that Bibi Netanyahu is not going to in any way endanger his country and all the accomplishments they made. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5861.34s)]
*  So you got Trump and you got Netanyahu. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5870.34s)]
*  And then you have the enemy. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5872.34s)]
*  I suspect if the enemy does what the enemy is likely to do at some point, then I believe I hope all this is out the window. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5875.34s)]
*  But I think I've also raised what I think are very important points related to this. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5884.34s)]
*  I mean, you got the Chinese, you got the Russians. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5894.34s)]
*  You've got the proxies. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5899.34s)]
*  So that's. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5903.34s)]
*  Yeah, an Iranian. Sorry, there's things coming up with the transom here. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5905.34s)]
*  Reports of an Iranian official going on scene and claiming they never got ceasefire orders. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5910.34s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5914.34s)]
*  We will see. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5917.34s)]
*  We will see. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5920.34s)]
*  I read the president's post. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5921.34s)]
*  There's certain specific things that need to be done. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5922.34s)]
*  I suspect if they're not done, then all bets are off. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5926.34s)]
*  There is always that. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5930.34s)]
*  As far as I can tell. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5933.34s)]
*  All right, let's get back to this. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5934.34s)]
*  Bernie Sanders. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5938.34s)]
*  The man who hates America. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5941.34s)]
*  The man who is a Stalinist has worshiped Stalin. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5944.34s)]
*  A Marxist Islamist. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5949.34s)]
*  Self-hating Jew. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5951.34s)]
*  The worst of the worst. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5955.34s)]
*  You have to scrape them off the bottom of your shoe and he's not the only one. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5956.34s)]
*  So Donald Trump taking out the enemy's nuclear sites. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5960.34s)]
*  Cut nine. Go. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5965.34s)]
*  And I want to tell you something. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5968.34s)]
*  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5970.34s)]
*  Doesn't this sound like. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5972.34s)]
*  One of these phony massive demonstrations by the Islamists in Iran. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5975.34s)]
*  Not the good Persians. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5980.34s)]
*  I'm talking about the jihadist Islamists. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5982.34s)]
*  When you hear them chanting like this, doesn't it? [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5985.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5987.34s)]
*  Let's start at the top. Go. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5988.34s)]
*  And I want to tell you something. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5991.34s)]
*  Not only is this news that I've just heard the second alarming that all of you have just heard. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=5994.34s)]
*  But it is so grossly unconstitutional. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6001.34s)]
*  All of you know. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6005.34s)]
*  What a drama queen, you damn bastard. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6006.34s)]
*  That's what you are. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6008.34s)]
*  It's so grossly unconstitutional. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6010.34s)]
*  So this guy wants a civil war. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6012.34s)]
*  You know, the Democrats want a civil war and they want a violent civil war. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6015.34s)]
*  Let's be honest. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6018.34s)]
*  They see what goes on in L.A. and they attack ICE. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6020.34s)]
*  The National Guard, the Marines, the Secretary of Defense, Secretary DHS, the President of the United States, the Vice President of the United States. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6025.34s)]
*  That's what they do. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6034.34s)]
*  They want it. They live by this. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6037.34s)]
*  Let's just be honest about it. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6038.34s)]
*  The importation of illegal aliens with criminal records, they don't even want them deported. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6040.34s)]
*  Well, that's pretty bizarre, don't you think? [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6046.34s)]
*  Not for them. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6048.34s)]
*  Light on sentences, judges, no prosecutor, prosecutors. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6050.34s)]
*  I mean, just look at the list. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6054.34s)]
*  Now, look, I have Adam Schiff here. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6059.34s)]
*  I've got Jim Hines, Democrat from Connecticut, is apparently the chairman of the Intelligence Committee. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6061.34s)]
*  You have to actually have no intelligence to be the chairman of the Intelligence Committee. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6067.34s)]
*  So Marco Rubio is on Face the Nation with this Margaret Brennan, who I despise. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6073.34s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6078.34s)]
*  They go on these shows and they debate them and some of them do well and some of them don't. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6079.34s)]
*  Why would Marco Rubio go on that show, not my show, Mr. Producer? [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6084.34s)]
*  When's the last time we asked him? [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6088.34s)]
*  Been a while, right? [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6092.34s)]
*  Let's put this to the test. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6093.34s)]
*  Let's invite Marco Rubio on the program any time this week, any day in any of the three hours. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6095.34s)]
*  Let's see what happens. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6102.34s)]
*  I'll let you know, America. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6104.34s)]
*  But here he is. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6106.34s)]
*  By the way, I admire what he's been doing. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6107.34s)]
*  Here we have Marco Rubio with Margaret Brennan on Deface the Nation, cut 14, go. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6112.34s)]
*  Let me follow up on a phrase you just worded, weaponization ambitions. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6119.34s)]
*  Are you saying there that the United States did not see intelligence that the Supreme Leader had ordered weaponization? [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6123.34s)]
*  That's irrelevant. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6132.34s)]
*  I think that question being asked in the media, that's an irrelevant question. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6134.34s)]
*  That is the key point in U.S. intelligence assessment. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6137.34s)]
*  You know that. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6140.34s)]
*  No, it's not. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6141.34s)]
*  Yes, it was. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6142.34s)]
*  No, it's not. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6143.34s)]
*  The political decision had not been made. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6144.34s)]
*  I know that better than you know that. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6145.34s)]
*  Why don't you let him answer the damn question? [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6146.34s)]
*  You bring in the guest, he's the Secretary of State, he's sitting at the table, he knows what the hell he's talking about. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6147.34s)]
*  And all you do is you bluster. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6151.34s)]
*  Let's stop it. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6156.34s)]
*  Let's start at the top again, Mr. Producer. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6157.34s)]
*  Go ahead. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6158.34s)]
*  Let me follow up on a phrase you just worded, weaponization ambitions. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6160.34s)]
*  Are you saying there that the United States did not see intelligence that the Supreme Leader had ordered weaponization? [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6164.34s)]
*  That's irrelevant. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6174.34s)]
*  I think that question being asked in the media, that's an irrelevant question. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6175.34s)]
*  That is the key point in U.S. intelligence assessment. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6178.34s)]
*  You know that. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6181.34s)]
*  No, it's not. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6182.34s)]
*  Yes, it was. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6183.34s)]
*  No, it's not. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6184.34s)]
*  The political decision had not been made. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6185.34s)]
*  I know that better than you know that, and I know that that's not the case. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6186.34s)]
*  But I'm asking whether the order was given. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6187.34s)]
*  And the people who say that, it doesn't matter if the order was given. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6189.34s)]
*  They have everything they need to build nuclear weapons. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6192.34s)]
*  Why would you bury things in a mountain 300 feet under the ground? [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6194.34s)]
*  Why would you bury six? [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6198.34s)]
*  Why do they have 60% enriched uranium? [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6199.34s)]
*  Let's stop. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6201.34s)]
*  Here's what she's saying. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6202.34s)]
*  Do you have evidence that he ordered it? [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6203.34s)]
*  So Ruby said, do I have evidence that he's ordered it? [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6208.34s)]
*  You see that mountain over there? [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6210.34s)]
*  See what's over there? [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6212.34s)]
*  What do you think's going on in there? [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6214.34s)]
*  We know what's going on in there. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6216.34s)]
*  See that other mountain over there? [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6217.34s)]
*  We know what's going on over there. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6219.34s)]
*  See that one over there? [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6220.34s)]
*  We know what's going on. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6221.34s)]
*  But did he order it? [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6222.34s)]
*  Now, come on, America. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6223.34s)]
*  Is that not sick? [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6226.34s)]
*  Go ahead. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6230.34s)]
*  The only countries in the world that have uranium at 60% are countries that have nuclear weapons. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6231.34s)]
*  Because it can quickly make it 90. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6236.34s)]
*  They have all the elements. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6238.34s)]
*  Why do they have a space program? [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6239.34s)]
*  Is Iran going to go to the moon? [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6241.34s)]
*  No. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6242.34s)]
*  They're trying to build an ICBM so they can one day put a warhead on it. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6243.34s)]
*  That's a question of intent. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6246.34s)]
*  And you know in the intelligence assessment that it was that Iran wanted to be a threshold seed. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6247.34s)]
*  How do you know what the intelligence assessment says? [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6252.34s)]
*  I'm talking about the public March assessment. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6254.34s)]
*  And that's why I was asking you if you know something more from March. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6256.34s)]
*  But that's also an inaccurate representation of it. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6259.34s)]
*  That's an inaccurate representation of it. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6261.34s)]
*  That's not how intelligence is read. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6263.34s)]
*  That's not how intelligence is used. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6265.34s)]
*  Here's what the whole world knows. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6267.34s)]
*  Forget about intelligence. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6268.34s)]
*  Can we slow down a minute here? [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6269.34s)]
*  Does this sound like a host who wants to get information from the Secretary of State about what actually took place? [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6273.34s)]
*  Does it? [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6280.34s)]
*  Does it? [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6282.34s)]
*  Does it sound like an a-hole who keeps interrupting him and trying to project her views on him? [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6283.34s)]
*  But why did she invite him? [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6288.34s)]
*  This is why I wonder why these guys go on these, but not just him. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6289.34s)]
*  Maybe it's worthwhile. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6294.34s)]
*  Maybe the oppressed people have a reason for this. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6295.34s)]
*  But my view is these people need to be frozen out. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6297.34s)]
*  Go ahead. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6302.34s)]
*  They are enriching uranium well beyond anything you need for a civil nuclear program. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6304.34s)]
*  So why would you enrich uranium at 60% if you don't intend to one day use it to take it to 90 and build a weapon? [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6310.34s)]
*  Why are you developing ICBMs? [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6317.34s)]
*  Why do you have 8,000 short-range missiles and 2,000 to 3,000 long mid-range missiles that you continue to develop? [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6319.34s)]
*  Why do you do all these things? [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6326.34s)]
*  They have everything they need for a nuclear weapon. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6327.34s)]
*  They have the delivery mechanisms. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6330.34s)]
*  They have the enrichment capability. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6331.34s)]
*  They have the high-level... [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6332.34s)]
*  You ask them a question. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6333.34s)]
*  Now he's giving you like the Rain Man, and that's good, point by point by point by point. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6334.34s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6340.34s)]
*  She's in a hurry. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6341.34s)]
*  I don't know what's going on. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6343.34s)]
*  Is she going to the green room to get some donuts? [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6344.34s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6346.34s)]
*  She got no patience. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6347.34s)]
*  My wife says about me, honey, you don't have any patience. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6349.34s)]
*  It's true. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6351.34s)]
*  But then again, this Margaret Brennan, if that is her name, she has no patience. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6352.34s)]
*  You're interrupting your guest. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6357.34s)]
*  Now for Bernie Sanders, this is wholly ungrutely unconstitutional. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6359.34s)]
*  Shut up, old man. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6364.34s)]
*  Let's slip in one more, Mr. Producer. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6369.34s)]
*  John Fetterman on Fox today. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6371.34s)]
*  I like this guy. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6374.34s)]
*  He's a good guy. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6375.34s)]
*  Ted 15 Go. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6376.34s)]
*  Yeah, well, I mean, for me, I'm sure. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6377.34s)]
*  I mean, there's going to be a lot of people in my party. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6380.34s)]
*  They're going to disagree with the strike in Iran. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6382.34s)]
*  And I actually support that. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6385.34s)]
*  I've been always calling for that thing. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6387.34s)]
*  I think it was entirely appropriate. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6388.34s)]
*  And again, there might be votes on that. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6390.34s)]
*  So for me, that's not a war. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6393.34s)]
*  That was a very limited military exercise. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6395.34s)]
*  And it struck that. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6398.34s)]
*  And then that's where we're at. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6399.34s)]
*  So severely. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6401.34s)]
*  It really wasn't about unconstitutional, or it's anything like that. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6402.34s)]
*  It was like a very, very limited military engagement. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6408.34s)]
*  And then it took them out, damaged them severely. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6412.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6416.34s)]
*  You know, this is a good man. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6418.34s)]
*  I don't agree with him on a lot. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6419.34s)]
*  Domestic policy, but he's what Democrats used to be. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6421.34s)]
*  He's relatively moderate on the big issues. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6424.34s)]
*  And that's the best we can get from a Democrat. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6428.34s)]
*  He's really good. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6430.34s)]
*  Of course, they want to destroy him. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6431.34s)]
*  He sends a lot smarter than Bannon or Katarlson. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6434.34s)]
*  MTG, no IQ. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6439.34s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6442.34s)]
*  Mud, love, in. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6443.34s)]
*  See if we can slip in some calls. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6455.34s)]
*  People have been waiting. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6457.34s)]
*  Okay. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6459.34s)]
*  Hold on, everybody. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6460.34s)]

*  All right. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6464.34s)]
*  Let's just start from the top here. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6465.34s)]
*  Let's see here. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6467.34s)]
*  Let's see. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6470.34s)]
*  Let's see. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6474.34s)]
*  All right. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6476.34s)]
*  Let's go to Dave Phoenix, Arizona. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6477.34s)]
*  LeGray KKNT. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6479.34s)]

*  Ultra MAGA FEMA Region 9. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6484.34s)]
*  Ditto's. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6486.34s)]
*  What an amazing time to be alive, right? [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6487.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6489.34s)]
*  It's the opposite. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6490.34s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6491.34s)]
*  Thanks be to God for President Donald J. Trump. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6493.34s)]
*  We got peace in the Middle East. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6496.34s)]
*  And that now allows us to deal with... [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6498.34s)]
*  What is with our phone system, Rich? [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6500.34s)]
*  Everybody's coming in and out. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6502.34s)]

*  I'm sorry. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6505.34s)]
*  Can you hear me? [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6506.34s)]
*  No, it's okay. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6507.34s)]
*  Like every third word. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6508.34s)]
*  I'm just glad we have peace in the Middle East so we can focus on TCP, [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6509.34s)]
*  China Fentanyl Poisoning, which killed half a million Americans in the last four years. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6513.34s)]
*  Oh, you don't really have... [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6518.34s)]
*  The president's focusing on that either. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6519.34s)]
*  Was one or the other? [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6521.34s)]
*  No, no. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6523.34s)]
*  He certainly is fighting the Thirty Front War and they're all... [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6524.34s)]
*  He definitely is. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6528.34s)]
*  All right, brother. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6529.34s)]
*  Thanks for your call. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6530.34s)]
*  Lance Kalispell, Montana, the great KJJR. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6531.34s)]
*  Good evening, sir. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6537.34s)]
*  Hey, I just want to make... [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6539.34s)]
*  I'm a simple nail bender, but I just want to make the observation that you're like the kid that shows up in our class with 128 color crayon box with the built-in sharpener when the rest of us have got like eight to 16 colors and three or four of them are already broken. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6541.34s)]
*  Secondly... [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6558.34s)]
*  Honest to God, I have no idea what that means, Rich. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6560.34s)]
*  Do you? [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6562.34s)]
*  Yeah, you bring me information at such a depth and level that... [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6565.34s)]
*  You're so kind. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6570.34s)]
*  By the way, I never had that box of crayons. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6571.34s)]
*  My parents were not... [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6573.34s)]
*  Well, I had what I could get, but thank you for that. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6575.34s)]
*  You're very kind. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6577.34s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6580.34s)]
*  And then secondly, you know, there's a lot of chatter that you don't hear on news or social media that you only find in Main Street taverns and gatherings on a Friday afternoon that even some of the people that are, you know, kind of criminal drug dealer members... [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6581.34s)]
*  You know what? [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6606.34s)]
*  Can we get this gentleman's number, Rich? [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6607.34s)]
*  I find you, Lance, very, very compelling. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6609.34s)]
*  So don't hang up. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6612.34s)]
*  We're going to take your number for tomorrow. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6613.34s)]
*  We salute our armed forces, police officers, firefighters, emergency personnel, our truckers, the men and women in Ukraine, the men and women in Israel. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6615.34s)]
*  And God bless America and you folks. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6623.34s)]
*  You are the best. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6626.34s)]
*  And thanks for being here and as loyal as you are. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6628.34s)]
*  And I'll see you tomorrow. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCWecWlwRo&t=6630.34s)]
