Video Description: On Wednesday’s Mark Levin Show, WJNO’s Brian Mudd fills in for Mark. Will we finally see accountability for James Comey, John Brennan, and James Clapper? CIA Director John Ratcliffe referred Brennan and Comey to the FBI for potential criminal prosecution. Accountability is important to prevent future misconduct, but if there were a trial, it would occur in Washington, D.C. As John Durham learned, there was no way to get an honest D.C. jury. Also, former White House physician Dr. Kevin O'Connor invoked his Fifth Amendment rights and remained silent during a House Oversight Committee interview, refusing to answer questions, including whether he was asked to lie about President Biden's health or if he believed Biden was unfit for duty. O'Connor's refusal to answer seems to show that he was in on the cover-up. Later, during the Biden administration, 59% of jobs (7.9 million) went to U.S.-born workers, while 41% (5.5 million) went to foreign-born workers, including many illegal immigrants. In the first five months of the Trump administration in 2025, 985,000 jobs were added, with a net decline of 735,000 foreign-born workers, resulting in 1.7 million more U.S.-born workers employed. This suggests U.S.-born workers are filling jobs previously held by immigrants, with significant self-deportation likely contributing, as deportations are minimal. Finally, President Trump is the second most efficient U.S. president, behind only FDR, for rapidly advancing his second-term agenda. In roughly 170 days, he signed 170 executive orders, 44 memoranda, 71 proclamations, and five laws, including the One Big Beautiful Bill. Despite a narrow congressional majority, he made the Tax Cut and Jobs Act permanent and introduced 27 tax code changes, retroactive to January 1, 2025, saving taxpayers money through deductions. His speed and success are historically remarkable.

# The Trump-Russia Probe: Unraveling the Dishonesty
**The Mark Levin Show:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk)
*  The radical left's agendas are attacking your American values, but conservatives like you haven't forgotten what this country was built on. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=0.0s)]
*  My friends, the Heritage Foundation exists to make sure your voice is heard and to represent your values in the swamp and quagmire of DC. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=7.0s)]
*  The Heritage Foundation stands for your values and will not give up the fight because they know you never will. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=15.0s)]
*  Paid for by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=22.0s)]
*  He's here. He's here. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=24.0s)]
*  Now broadcasting from the Underground Command Post, deep in the bowels of a hidden bunker, somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building, we once again make contact with our leader, Mark LeVen. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=27.0s)]
*  James Comey and John Brennan, now under criminal investigation related to the Trump-Russia probe. Do you want to see these two guys behind bars? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=46.0s)]
*  Well, I know nothing about it other than what I read today, but I will tell you, I think they're very dishonest people. I think they're crooked as hell. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=55.0s)]
*  And maybe they have to pay a price for that. I believe they are truly bad people and dishonest people. So whatever happens, happens. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=64.0s)]
*  Yeah, bad hombres, bad hombres. Comey, Brennan and company. True Rewards. Never been spoken than what Trump uttered there. Could we actually have accountability for Comey and company? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=76.0s)]
*  Dr. Who and the NEA ditching the ADL as we get going today. Hey there, it is Brian Mudd in for Mark LeVen. Always a pleasure to be here with you. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=89.0s)]
*  And yeah, we had a lot of moving pieces as we navigate what's in the news today and what is going on over the past couple of days. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=102.0s)]
*  Of course, this news broke last night. Fox News, the first with the story that brought Comey and Brennan and Clapper and company back into the mix. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=110.0s)]
*  So walk through this here for a moment with me. We've got James Comey and his seashells. You've got John Brennan and Hunter's horse. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=123.0s)]
*  By the way, if you're wondering like the connection there, remember Brennan, one of the 51 Intel officials, he right before the 2020 election said, oh yeah, yeah, you know, the the Hunter laptop. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=137.0s)]
*  That is all the hallmarks of Russian disinformation there. So John Brennan, of course, a protector of Hunter, his crack and Hunter's crack horse. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=146.0s)]
*  You've got James clap on clap off James Clapper, his proclivity to spy on you. If you recall back in the day. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=156.0s)]
*  Peas in a pod, those three peas in a pot, bad hombres, as Trump might might say. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=166.0s)]
*  Now, they have probably much more in common than you even knew. You know, long before the trio were busy corrupting the FBI and intelligence agencies. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=174.0s)]
*  They actually all got their starts and the federal government in a very similar way. Did you know that all three received their first appointments and the federal government? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=186.0s)]
*  How did these people get in the federal government in the first place? Well, they all got there via Bush. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=199.0s)]
*  By a Bush. Yeah, Clapper was first appointed as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency by George H.W. Bush in 1991. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=205.0s)]
*  While Comey's first federal gig, that was as a U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=218.0s)]
*  I was opposed that George W. Bush appointed him to in 2002. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=224.0s)]
*  And as for Brennan, it was in 2004 that W appointed him to be the acting director of the National Counterterrorism Center. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=230.0s)]
*  So anyway, somewhere along the way, well before special prosecutor John Durham filed his three hundred and sixteen page report entitled Report on Matters Related to Intelligence Activities and Investigations [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=241.0s)]
*  arising out of the twenty sixteen presidential campaigns. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=256.0s)]
*  He dropped that in twenty twenty three just over two years ago. If you'll recall, it feels much longer than that, actually. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=261.0s)]
*  But was in May of twenty twenty three. He went back and found that again today. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=267.0s)]
*  But somewhere along the way in that whole window of time, I lost track of how many hundreds of hours of my life. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=274.0s)]
*  That I spent lost diving into that. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=284.0s)]
*  That rabbit hole. Investigating, analyzing the Trump Russia collusion hoax over the course of a few years. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=289.0s)]
*  It just. Painful, painful to even kind of think back there. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=296.0s)]
*  It was also about the time. The whole Durham. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=303.0s)]
*  Report situation is also about the time that I lost any hope of meaningful accountability coming out of it. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=308.0s)]
*  But then last week, you had CIA Director John Radcliffe, he declassified the CIA's review of the Steele dossier and the related Trump Russia collusion hoax. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=317.0s)]
*  In the review, you had nuggets like this speaking about the Steele dossier. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=328.0s)]
*  You know, citing the CIA implicitly elevated unsubstantiated claims to the status of credible supporting evidence compromising the analytical integrity of the judgment. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=333.0s)]
*  OK, so that is a quote from last week's release from the CIA. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=346.0s)]
*  In other words, they knew that the dossier was not credible crap. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=354.0s)]
*  They always did. But, you know, they used it to try to trap and to take out Trump anyway. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=358.0s)]
*  Things we knew now among the disclosed filing, the findings of the filing, you had Brennan's own Deputy CIA Director for Analysis. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=364.0s)]
*  He warned Brennan in a memo that the dossier was discredited. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=373.0s)]
*  And that actually moving forward with it as evidence against the president would jeopardize the credibility of the agency. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=378.0s)]
*  I mean, that's fun. And of course, Brennan just looked right past that. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=386.0s)]
*  We also learned that a total of 13 other intelligence agencies were taking out the loop by Brennan. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=390.0s)]
*  And as we've known since the Nunes memo dropped February 2nd of 2018. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=397.0s)]
*  Good old James Seychelles, Comey. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=402.0s)]
*  He knew the Steele dossier was garbage, too. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=406.0s)]
*  I mean, of course, the FBI had fired Christopher Steele because of his lack of credibility. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=409.0s)]
*  Yet Comey went on to sign three FISA requests using the Steele dossier as evidence to surveil on candidate Trump, then President-elect Trump and eventually President Trump. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=415.0s)]
*  And Comey was there at all stages of this thing, signing FISA warrants, among other things. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=427.0s)]
*  And as for Clapper, who was all in on this, too. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=434.0s)]
*  It was a House intelligence investigation long ago concluded that it was he who leaked the fake dossier to the news media to kind of kick off that whole end of things. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=439.0s)]
*  Remember the whole Mother Jones and Yahoo News thing? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=451.0s)]
*  I mean, it's like the absurdities of the absurdities of that situation going all the way way back when. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=454.0s)]
*  Now, in addition to their responsibility for the entirety of the Russian collusion hoax ever becoming what it became. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=461.0s)]
*  The three had seemingly committed perjury before congressional committees, effectively aligned for years with impunity and then better still profiting off of it. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=469.0s)]
*  Because, I mean, of course, they became heroes of the left. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=479.0s)]
*  So, you know, they were able to cash in. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=482.0s)]
*  Yeah, Clapper, he went to work for CNN. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=484.0s)]
*  Brennan, he went to NBC. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=487.0s)]
*  And Comey, he cashed in with the multi-million dollar book deal for his hilariously named book, A Higher Loyalty, which was also known as Tall Tales by James Comey. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=491.0s)]
*  So after all these years, after all the lies, after Comey's seashells, could accountability finally, right about now, be coming? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=504.0s)]
*  So, yeah, as was first reported last night by Fox News, you do have CIA Director John Radcliffe. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=521.0s)]
*  He's referred John Brennan and James Comey to the FBI for potential criminal prosecution. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=528.0s)]
*  Now, for those who believe in accountability, an important thing, right? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=535.0s)]
*  Very important thing that there is actually accountability. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=538.0s)]
*  If nobody is held to account, what is to discourage anybody from doing this stuff again? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=541.0s)]
*  Now, here is the thing, and it is a considerable one before you get your hopes up. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=548.0s)]
*  It's where accountability would have to take place. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=556.0s)]
*  It would have to take place in Washington, D.C. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=560.0s)]
*  And here's the biggest problem of all. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=564.0s)]
*  And what eventually stalled John Durham's investigation wasn't the facts of the situation. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=567.0s)]
*  The D.C. swamp creatures, boy, they're not only the deep state actors that work in government agencies. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=574.0s)]
*  No, they're also potential jurors. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=581.0s)]
*  Should you have cases that are ever brought to trial? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=584.0s)]
*  And by the way, all of these related swamp creatures know this. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=588.0s)]
*  Part of the reason that you have all of these creeps like Comey, like Brennan, like Clapper and company that do what they do in part is like, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=592.0s)]
*  what is ever going to happen to us, especially if we went after Trump? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=601.0s)]
*  Right? Because where does accountability have to take place? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=606.0s)]
*  Well, it would have to take place if it got to a trial. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=611.0s)]
*  It would have to take place in Washington, D.C. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=615.0s)]
*  And as Durham came to learn when he began to try his Trump-Russia collusion cases, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=619.0s)]
*  there was absolutely no way that he was going to get a D.C. jury to be honest. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=626.0s)]
*  There's no way that he would get a D.C. jury to find the colluding actors of the Trump-Russia collusion hoax. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=634.0s)]
*  No matter how guilty, no matter how overwhelming the evidence was, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=642.0s)]
*  they were never going to say any of them were guilty because they agreed with anything to take down Trump. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=646.0s)]
*  They were TDSers to the core. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=653.0s)]
*  You're talking about a location in D.C. that is so corrupt, just so rife with a lack of reality that reflects nothing throughout this country. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=656.0s)]
*  Only 6% of voters voted for Trump. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=668.0s)]
*  I mean, San Francisco looks conservative by way of comparison. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=671.0s)]
*  Brennan and Comey and company deserve to be put through everything that Trump has been put through and more. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=677.0s)]
*  And sometimes the process is, you know, the process itself can effectively be the punishment, right? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=685.0s)]
*  I mean, this was the case with a lot of what was going on with Trump, although they certainly wanted to actually put him behind bars, certainly tried to. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=691.0s)]
*  But the process at times is effectively the punishment. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=698.0s)]
*  And the problem in this situation is given the political makeup of any potential D.C. juries, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=702.0s)]
*  the process is likely to be the only punishment ever seen by these corrupt people. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=709.0s)]
*  And sadly, they know it. And that is a whole other problem that we get into with how do you ever discourage bad actors like this from acting badly again and into the future? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=715.0s)]
*  And speaking of corrupt coverups, boy, let's talk a little bit about Dr. Who, huh? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=728.0s)]
*  Dr. Who. So unlike the man who traveled in the TARDIS, who carried with him his own secrets, former White House physician Kevin O'Connor, he had himself a day today. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=736.0s)]
*  Very interesting short little day that this doctor had is pleading the fifth in a closed door House Oversight Committee interview all throughout the day today. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=749.0s)]
*  This was an interesting thing. So we'll get into Dr. Who next. I'm Brian Mudd. And for the great one. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=761.0s)]
*  Mudd, love in. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=769.0s)]
*  Folks, the American flag is under attack. We saw it mocked and burned in L.A. during protests. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=777.0s)]
*  And when people attack the American flag, aren't they attacking everything it stands for? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=782.0s)]
*  The sacrifice of our troops, the values of our founding, the promise of liberty and justice for all. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=786.0s)]
*  Thankfully, patriots like you haven't forgotten what the flag stands for. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=791.0s)]
*  You're the reason the Heritage Foundation created Flags of Our Fathers, the meaning and history of the U.S. flag. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=795.0s)]
*  This is a resource for patriots like you to remind and refresh ourselves of the American flag's history and deep importance to our nation. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=801.0s)]
*  Claim your free copy today at heritage.org slash Levin. That's heritage.org slash L E V I N. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=809.0s)]
*  If we lose the meaning of our flag, we risk losing our nation. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=816.0s)]
*  That's why it's imperative that patriots just like you take advantage of the Heritage Foundation's new resource, Flags of Our Fathers. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=819.0s)]
*  Let's do our part in this fight by going to heritage.org slash Levin right now. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=826.0s)]
*  Heritage.org slash L E V I N. Paid for by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=831.0s)]
*  It is hard to believe that here we are eight and a half years after we're still going over this ground that has been, I think, fairly well and exhaustively plowed. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=836.0s)]
*  First of all, I should say I know nothing about this reported investigation or referral to the DOJ other than what I've read in these press reports, these leaks, which are not really supposed to happen if there is an investigation going on. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=852.0s)]
*  Secondly, nobody from the FBI or Department of Justice or CIA has reached out to me at all. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=864.0s)]
*  So I am just waiting to hear more about what this might be. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=870.0s)]
*  Oh, and he laughed and he laughed. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=874.0s)]
*  John Brennan on MSNBC. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=876.0s)]
*  I don't know anything about these investigations. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=879.0s)]
*  By the way, leaking leaking is really not supposed to happen. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=881.0s)]
*  You know, oh, my gosh, these people, they can't help themselves. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=885.0s)]
*  Oh, my. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=890.0s)]
*  There is entertainment to be had. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=891.0s)]
*  By the way, speaking of John Brennan and entertainment to be had, Brian Mudd in for Mark Levin. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=893.0s)]
*  We will get to Dr. O'Connor and his situation here momentarily. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=899.0s)]
*  But I actually did find this just kind of hilarious today when I was pulling up Brennan. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=903.0s)]
*  I was like, Oh, let's see what he has done socially recently. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=908.0s)]
*  And the answer is nothing. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=913.0s)]
*  But it's like you take a look at how well things age. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=915.0s)]
*  So if you go back over the most recent post on next by John Brennan, the first thing is if you go to his page, I always like this. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=921.0s)]
*  The people you might like, it recommends Alexander Vindman, James Comey and Adam Schiff. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=929.0s)]
*  There you go. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=935.0s)]
*  That is that is a group of winners right there. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=936.0s)]
*  When you take a look at the most recent post. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=940.0s)]
*  There they move for most recent two in 2022 and then two last year around the presidential election. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=945.0s)]
*  In 2022, in December, Dr. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=955.0s)]
*  Fauci is a national hero who will be remembered for generations to come for his innate goodness and many contributions to public health. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=957.0s)]
*  OK, you have that then in reference to Elon Musk, who he was going after this also on the same day in December of 2022. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=967.0s)]
*  He said good people and democracies need a more effective way to prevent attention craving emotionally immature and highly devious individuals, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=976.0s)]
*  especially those of means from being socially, culturally and politically destructive. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=985.0s)]
*  We need a more effective way. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=991.0s)]
*  I could also jump in and say, well, we don't actually have a democracy. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=993.0s)]
*  We happen to be a representative Republican. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=998.0s)]
*  There is no functional democracy. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1000.0s)]
*  It's survive for any length of time in world history. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1002.0s)]
*  But rather than traveling down that place, we need a more effective way to prevent them. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1004.0s)]
*  I mean, a little Marxist, are we, John? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1010.0s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1014.0s)]
*  How would you propose that we prevent attention craving emotionally mature people from getting attention? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1015.0s)]
*  And then last year, the two most recent on the day that Biden dropped out, President Biden's love of country decency and wisdom have never been on greater display. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1024.0s)]
*  An outstanding president of the United States and lifelong public servant. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1034.0s)]
*  He is doing his absolute best to ensure that Donald Trump never again wields presidential authorities. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1038.0s)]
*  We are all forever in his debt. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1043.0s)]
*  And then on Election Day last year, Kamala Harris for president, our future of prosperity, security, global leadership and national decency depend on her election. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1045.0s)]
*  Let's make it happen. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1054.0s)]
*  So that's what's been going on with with John Brennan when he is not on MSNBC. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1056.0s)]
*  And that's sad, sad man. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1063.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1065.0s)]
*  All right. So speaking of sad man, sad situation in the Biden administration and the cover up of his well-being. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1066.0s)]
*  So, Dr. Who, in this case, we are not talking about a great British show. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1074.0s)]
*  We are we're talking talking about former Biden White House physician Kevin O'Connor. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1081.0s)]
*  So today he took to pleading the fifth and a closed door house oversight committee. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1086.0s)]
*  This in relation to President Biden's health. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1093.0s)]
*  So that's kind of interesting, isn't it? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1097.0s)]
*  Why would you play the fifth to pretty much everything? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1099.0s)]
*  Even more when you consider the questions that he played the fifth to. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1102.0s)]
*  They included. Were you ever told to lie about the president's health? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1107.0s)]
*  Were you ever told to lie about the president's health? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1114.0s)]
*  He took the fifth. Did you ever believe President Biden was unfit to execute his duty? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1118.0s)]
*  He took the fifth. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1126.0s)]
*  OK, so that's kind of fun, isn't it? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1129.0s)]
*  Why would you take the fifth in relation to those two questions that don't have anything to do with anything other than just if you were asked to lie? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1132.0s)]
*  We'll get into that next. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1142.0s)]
*  Brian Mudd in for the great one. Mark Levin. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1143.0s)]
*  Folks, we've seen in our streets over the past several months the burning of the American flag. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1150.0s)]
*  Even worse, we saw the Mexican flag and the Palestinian flag wave defiantly during L.A.'s violent riots. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1154.0s)]
*  There's something seriously wrong with that picture. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1160.0s)]
*  The American flag is under attack across the country and with it the American promise of liberty. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1162.0s)]
*  But while the left attacks our flag and everything else we hold dear, bold conservatives like you across the country refuse to let the flag fall. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1167.0s)]
*  That's why the Heritage Foundation created Flags of Our Fathers, a critical resource for patriots who want to remind ourselves of the American flag's history. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1176.0s)]
*  Flags of Our Fathers contains the untold history of the flag's creation and the meaning of the stars and stripes. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1185.0s)]
*  Let's take a stand for the American flag today by going to heritage.org slash Levin, heritage.org slash L-E-V-I-N, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1191.0s)]
*  and claiming your free copy of Flags of Our Fathers. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1198.0s)]
*  That's heritage.org slash L-E-V-I-N, paid for by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1202.0s)]
*  Saving America, one show at a time. The Mark Levin Show, 877-381-3811. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1208.0s)]
*  Dr. O'Connor, did you take the fifth at all points? [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1218.0s)]
*  Did you take the fifth because you're trying to cover up what the president's state was? [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1222.0s)]
*  Is he healthy now? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1228.0s)]
*  That is Fox's Chad Pergram trying to chase down and get any words whatsoever out of former White House physician Kevin O'Connor [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1230.0s)]
*  after that's pretty much all he did during the course of a House Oversight Committee interview today. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1238.0s)]
*  Just sat there and was quiet and pled the fifth on everything. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1245.0s)]
*  Hey there, Brian Mudd in for Mark Levin. It is always an honor and a pleasure being here with you. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1250.0s)]
*  I am the host of The Brian Mudd Show. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1256.0s)]
*  Broadcasts out at my home station, WJNO in West Palm Beach. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1258.0s)]
*  You can check out The Brian Mudd Show wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1262.0s)]
*  Connect socially at Brian Mudd Radio. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1266.0s)]
*  And as we take a look at this situation with former White House physician Kevin O'Connor. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1270.0s)]
*  So a couple things that stand out about this. Questions that he pled the fifth to included, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1276.0s)]
*  were you ever told to lie about the president's health? [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1286.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1292.0s)]
*  Why would you need to take the fifth to that? [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1294.0s)]
*  That did you ever believe President Biden was unfit to execute his duty? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1298.0s)]
*  Mums the word. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1305.0s)]
*  And so that's that's interesting, huh? [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1308.0s)]
*  Now, in response, the attorney for Dr. O'Connor said this. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1312.0s)]
*  He said revealing confidential patient information would violate the most fundamental ethical duty of a physician, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1318.0s)]
*  could result in revocation of Dr. O'Connor's medical license. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1326.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, that probably should happen at this point and would subject Dr. O'Connor to potential civil liability. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1330.0s)]
*  Dr. O'Connor will not violate his oath of confidentiality to any of his patients, including President Biden. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1338.0s)]
*  Uh huh. Uh huh. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1347.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1351.0s)]
*  So let me get this straight, counselor. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1353.0s)]
*  You're stating your client refused to answer questions due to physician patient privilege. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1356.0s)]
*  We can't have any personal health information being disclosed. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1364.0s)]
*  That'd be a violation. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1368.0s)]
*  Uh huh. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1370.0s)]
*  So right. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1372.0s)]
*  How does this have to do with divulging any of Biden's personal medical information? [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1375.0s)]
*  What part of answering whether your client was asked to lie about Biden's health has anything to do with Biden's medical history? [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1383.0s)]
*  Has anything to do with confidentiality of Biden's health? [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1392.0s)]
*  So clearly this attorney is full of crap. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1399.0s)]
*  He clearly thinks you are stupid. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1403.0s)]
*  As does Dr. Who. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1406.0s)]
*  Dr. O'Connor here. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1410.0s)]
*  Obviously, the White House physician knew some things, said some things publicly that were potentially incriminating. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1414.0s)]
*  Now look, none of us needed to be doctors. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1421.0s)]
*  None of us needed to be any closer to Dementia Joe than our TV screens to obviously be able to see and hear what was really going on there. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1425.0s)]
*  So it's not as though any of this really comes as a big surprise. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1435.0s)]
*  But it really does just kind of paint the picture of how bad it really was and how bad the situation has been when White House physicians are in on it. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1439.0s)]
*  When they're all in on the fix. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1454.0s)]
*  With that said, one thing that is slowly but surely happening here is that the cover up on the whole Biden onion is unraveling layer by layer. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1457.0s)]
*  You do get the sense that this whole thing will end up coming out slowly, one person, one layer of that onion at a time. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1472.0s)]
*  This thing was was pretty obvious for what it was today. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1484.0s)]
*  Something else I wanted to dive in on today. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1489.0s)]
*  Oh, actually, let's see. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1493.0s)]
*  We got Jim, who is before I dive into that, Jim wanted to weigh in on this in Blacksburg, Virginia. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1495.0s)]
*  Let's see what Jim has. Welcome to the show. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1502.0s)]
*  Yes, sir. The reason that I would not answer any question, even down to my name, without invoking the Fifth Amendment would be as you were talking just a minute ago about the onion being peeled back. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1506.0s)]
*  And who would want extra charges, possibility of whatever could come of lying to Congress. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1522.0s)]
*  And that's what would wind up happening. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1531.0s)]
*  So there's no duty. There's there's no responsibility to be forthright and trying to see if we had a president that was unfit to serve that was, you know, put out there and impart by this doctor. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1535.0s)]
*  There's. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1551.0s)]
*  We're just to just to say that's cool. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1553.0s)]
*  Doctor has no responsibility in asking if he was asked to lie, not even if he did lie, but just if he was asked to. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1557.0s)]
*  I'm not I'm not saying that he'd what he that he was right in what he done and any form of cover up. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1565.0s)]
*  I did not like my to start with have never voted for the man for I wouldn't vote him dog catcher. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1572.0s)]
*  I am a Trump voter voted for him three times and I'm thankful for each time. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1577.0s)]
*  But however, if I were in that man's shoes and anybody else that were in that man's shoes, they would invoke the fifth on everything too. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1585.0s)]
*  I understand. I appreciate that. I appreciate the college. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1597.0s)]
*  And I get that any attorney in a similar situation is likely to tell their client to do the same thing to me. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1600.0s)]
*  It really puts I think in front of all of us. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1609.0s)]
*  What this is really about. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1614.0s)]
*  It's not about doing the right thing, right? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1616.0s)]
*  If you're a doctor and especially a White House physician. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1618.0s)]
*  You have a responsibility to not just the president United States, but also to the American public, do you not? [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1625.0s)]
*  And when you're not even willing to answer a question about whether you were asked to lie. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1633.0s)]
*  I think that says something about your character because clearly you are more concerned about information that could be potentially be held against you later. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1641.0s)]
*  Then you were about doing your job ethically in the first place. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1650.0s)]
*  And upholding your responsibility both to the president at the time, but also the responsibility to the American people as well. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1655.0s)]
*  What that does is it speaks to the character of the individual. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1664.0s)]
*  Now, secondarily, what is just so insulting is the extent to which this attorney thinks we're stupid. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1671.0s)]
*  You know, if you're what Jim was just mentioning is right. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1680.0s)]
*  And if he had come out and said that and just been honest with us. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1684.0s)]
*  OK, well, at least we're having a on the level of conversation about what this is really about. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1688.0s)]
*  Which isn't about whether Dr. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1695.0s)]
*  O'Connor is a dishonest man, whether he was asked to do dishonest things, whether he was involved in the cover, none of that. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1697.0s)]
*  But then to say that this answering these questions would have revealed confidential patient information that would violate ethical duty of a physician. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1706.0s)]
*  The only ethical thing that was violated was everything that had to do with the responsibility of Dr. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1717.0s)]
*  O'Connor quite clearly. And so that is the biggest affront in this whole situation is that we are treated as though we're stupid. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1724.0s)]
*  And that is something that that I find to be offensive. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1732.0s)]
*  Let's go to Bruce Bruce on this one as well in New Jersey. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1736.0s)]
*  Welcome to the show. Thank you very much, Mr. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1741.0s)]
*  I'm a pleasure to get out of it. So I was just listening. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1745.0s)]
*  I was just listening to your comments about the doctor taking the Fifth Amendment and all that. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1748.0s)]
*  And one of the questions you said, well, can he answer the question about whether or not he was ever asked to lie? [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1753.0s)]
*  But I believe that once he starts answering any question, you can't pick and choose what questions you want to answer. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1759.0s)]
*  So I think I'd have to go back and look this up. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1766.0s)]
*  But I think once you start answering, answer any question, then you've waived the privilege. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1768.0s)]
*  So actually, so actually, Bruce, that was not the case. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1775.0s)]
*  And as we were told, he did answer a apparently a few select questions and all that has not been disclosed at this point. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1778.0s)]
*  But we were informed that there were a few things that he was willing to to address. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1787.0s)]
*  Well, almost the entire time in this session, he ended up pleading the fifth. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1793.0s)]
*  So that is not ultimately the situation that played out here. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1797.0s)]
*  And again, independent of that, the bigger issue being, you know, from where I sit, that you have the attorney that is coming back and trying to say that this isn't about, you know, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1802.0s)]
*  protecting his client from what he likely was involved with with the cover up and incriminating himself through his testimony to this committee. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1814.0s)]
*  But instead, it was really about protecting, you know, the from an ethical, professional position, the client confidentiality of President Biden. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1823.0s)]
*  That's what we're really trying to do is such an ethical and fine, upstanding man. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1835.0s)]
*  Let's go to Stephen and Wilmington, North Carolina. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1841.0s)]
*  Stephen, welcome to the show. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1845.0s)]
*  Hello. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1846.0s)]
*  Hey, you're on, Stephen. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1850.0s)]
*  Hey, we got you. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1854.0s)]
*  I'm just upset about the Epstein deal with Trump and cash Patel, Dan Bongino and Pam Bondi. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1856.0s)]
*  After all, yes, yes, sir. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1864.0s)]
*  Get them elected and they just rolled over, it seems like. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1866.0s)]
*  What's your opinion on that? [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1870.0s)]
*  OK, so I could do a lot on this. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1872.0s)]
*  And I and I actually have locally done a lot on this. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1875.0s)]
*  One of the things about the whole Epstein deal that is a big local news story for me at home. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1878.0s)]
*  Of course, Palm Beach, primary home of Epstein. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1885.0s)]
*  And just over 20 years ago, he was in high schools in this area hunting girls for his operation. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1889.0s)]
*  And I've covered the story for about 20 years. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1899.0s)]
*  All of the shenanigans that played out in the original prosecution, everything that was allowed to happen after the facts. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1903.0s)]
*  Everything that that has gone down up until recently. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1914.0s)]
*  And there is no doubt, no doubt that there are some things that are extraordinarily problematic. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1918.0s)]
*  So you have Pam Bondi on in February with John Roberts on Fox News. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1923.0s)]
*  She's asked the question about the client list from Epstein. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1928.0s)]
*  And she says that she has it on her desk right now and ready to review. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1934.0s)]
*  Along with the MLK files and and the JFK files. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1939.0s)]
*  So don't hold your breath on those if you were thinking of doing so. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1945.0s)]
*  And then we get this leak first through Axios and then they come out on Monday and say, oh, yeah, no, no client list at all. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1949.0s)]
*  No client list at all, which really doesn't add up for any number of reasons that we could spend a whole show breaking down. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1957.0s)]
*  But especially when you consider that Pam said in February that it was on her desk. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1965.0s)]
*  Now, Pam did answer to this yesterday. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1970.0s)]
*  And she said that basically it was a misunderstanding because she was saying the file was on her desk, even though the question was about the client list. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1973.0s)]
*  Well, it was the file and she still had to review it. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1982.0s)]
*  And when she did, in theory, there was no client list case closed. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1986.0s)]
*  And then you also get the video drop of the cell. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1989.0s)]
*  And this is where you want to talk about the situation with Bonjino. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1994.0s)]
*  So, of course, Deputy FBI Director Bonjino a few weeks back said that, hey, I've reviewed the video evidence. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=1997.0s)]
*  It really was nothing that went down, nothing conspiratorial the night that that Epstein died. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2004.0s)]
*  He killed himself. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2010.0s)]
*  So we get this video and we see that it is from a second story in the prison. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2012.0s)]
*  Looks like some kind of like outside janitorial area looking down in a hallway that in theory leads to Epstein cell. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2017.0s)]
*  So it wasn't even like, yeah, you clearly can tell that this is going to be Epstein cell that is at the end of this hallway down there. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2023.0s)]
*  And then at the end of that, you take a look and you see that, well, at eleven fifty eight fifty eight, the video skips to midnight on the nose. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2030.0s)]
*  And they didn't have anything to say about that either. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2040.0s)]
*  So there are some things that are very problematic in all this. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2043.0s)]
*  Absolutely problematic in all this. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2049.0s)]
*  And this, of course, is to speak nothing of Elon Musk and what he came out with with the falling out when he posted about the reason the client list wasn't posted is because Trump is on it. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2052.0s)]
*  And then he deleted that post. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2062.0s)]
*  And then he said he regretted it, but it still happened. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2064.0s)]
*  So, yeah, there are a lot of things that are not cool about that situation. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2068.0s)]
*  We need more information. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2071.0s)]
*  We need the truth. And Pam Bondi has a lot of explaining to do. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2073.0s)]
*  I'm Brian Mudd and for the great one. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2076.0s)]
*  Folks, the American flag is under attack. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2086.0s)]
*  We saw it mocked and burned in L.A. during protests. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2088.0s)]
*  And when people attack the American flag, aren't they attacking everything it stands for? [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2091.0s)]
*  The sacrifice of our troops, the values of our founding, the promise of liberty and justice for all. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2095.0s)]
*  Thankfully, patriots like you haven't forgotten what the flag stands for. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2100.0s)]
*  You're the reason the Heritage Foundation created Flags of Our Fathers, the meaning and history of the U.S. flag. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2104.0s)]
*  This is a resource for patriots like you to remind and refresh ourselves of the American flag's history and deep importance to our nation. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2110.0s)]

*  If we lose the meaning of our flag, we risk losing our nation. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2125.0s)]
*  That's why it's imperative that patriots just like you take advantage of the Heritage Foundation's new resource, Flags of Our Fathers. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2128.0s)]
*  Let's do our part in this fight by going to heritage.org slash Levin right now. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2135.0s)]
*  Heritage.org slash L.E.V.I.N. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2140.0s)]
*  Paid for by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2143.0s)]
*  Well, because he already deserves it. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2148.0s)]
*  He helped broker the historic Abraham Accords in which Israel made peace with four Arab states. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2153.0s)]
*  We worked on this together secretly for three years and wham, in one month we made four peace treaties, [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2160.0s)]
*  which by itself should have given him the Nobel Prize already. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2167.0s)]
*  But he's not stopping. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2171.0s)]
*  I mean, he made peace between Rwanda and the Congo. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2173.0s)]
*  That was a bloody conflict. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2177.0s)]
*  And he just made that peace. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2178.0s)]
*  He made he'll make the peace now between India and Pakistan. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2180.0s)]
*  Bibi, they're no talking about his nominating of President Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2185.0s)]
*  something that President Trump I'm sure will win over about the time that hell freezes over. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2191.0s)]
*  But nevertheless, the right thing to do was Bibi pointing out like there have been no presidents that have brought peace generally the way that President Trump has. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2196.0s)]
*  You go back to his first term. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2206.0s)]
*  Remember the ISIS caliphate and what happened? [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2208.0s)]
*  He ran on saying, hey, you know, if I get elected, I'm going to bomb the blank out of ISIS. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2211.0s)]
*  What happened? He got elected. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2216.0s)]
*  He bought the blank out of ISIS. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2218.0s)]
*  They went away. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2220.0s)]
*  Caliphate went away and we ended up having relative world peace. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2221.0s)]
*  Then you have Biden chaos happens. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2224.0s)]
*  What happens? [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2227.0s)]
*  We get Trump back and you take a look at the whole situation with Iran. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2228.0s)]
*  I mentioned this last week. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2231.0s)]
*  You know how long we've been talking about Iran and their nuclear program? [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2233.0s)]
*  Forty one years, forty one years. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2235.0s)]
*  That's how long they have been working on it. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2238.0s)]
*  Trump goes in, he drops 14 MOPs and boom, the whole nuclear program thing, you know, suddenly is a different kind of conversation. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2239.0s)]
*  And then you have peace between Iran and Israel. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2247.0s)]
*  And that is held. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2252.0s)]
*  And now we're talking about a ceasefire being negotiated as well. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2253.0s)]
*  So, yeah, there's no doubt that President Trump deserves the Nobel Peace Prize. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2255.0s)]
*  By the way, he also signed an executive order over the past week where he is establishing a bunch of envoys that are going to go around trying to negotiate peace everywhere. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2262.0s)]
*  He mentioned that he's really unhappy with Putin, really unhappy with Russia. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2270.0s)]
*  He wants peace and he is serious about seeking it. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2274.0s)]
*  So he's continuing down that path as well. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2277.0s)]
*  Now, one of the things that I mentioned at the top of the show that I wanted to get into this hour, the NEA ditching the ADL. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2280.0s)]
*  This is something else that happened today and that is really important as we're speaking about Jewish related things. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2288.0s)]
*  So a couple of just quick housekeeping notes about the NEA. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2294.0s)]
*  First, your average drag queen, far more attractive than Randy Weingarten. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2298.0s)]
*  Take the average queen over Randy Weingarten aesthetically any day and also a lot easier on the ears to listen to as well. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2304.0s)]
*  The average drag queen. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2311.0s)]
*  Second, your average drag queen's performance, far more redeeming than anything that Randy Weingarten does. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2312.0s)]
*  So today, the country's largest teachers union, the Randy Weingarten led NEA, managed to reach yet another new low. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2319.0s)]
*  They ended up voting themselves out of the use of ADL provided materials. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2327.0s)]
*  Yeah, the anti-Semitism at the NEA as well. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2336.0s)]

*  He's here. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2363.0s)]
*  He's here. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2364.0s)]
*  Now broadcasting from the underground command post, deep in the bowels of a hidden bunker, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2367.0s)]
*  somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building, we once again make contact with our leader, Mark LeVein. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2373.0s)]
*  We are going to continue to focus our efforts as we did on the House floor in connection with Donald Trump's one big ugly bill [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2385.0s)]
*  on pushing back against the extremism that has been unleashed on the American people. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2394.0s)]
*  It's clear to us as House Democrats, it's clear to us as members of the New York City delegation, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2399.0s)]
*  that the problem is Donald Trump and House Republicans who have launched this unprecedented assault on the American way of life, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2404.0s)]
*  an assault on health care, they're ripping food out of the mouths of children, veterans and seniors, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2411.0s)]
*  they're exploding the national debt, they're unleashing mass agents on law abiding immigrant communities. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2416.0s)]
*  It shouldn't be too difficult for some people to figure out who the problem is in the United States of America. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2424.0s)]
*  You know, it's not fair. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2431.0s)]
*  You know, it's been at least a few weeks since I saw a child trying to feed himself. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2432.0s)]
*  And I went in and just grabbed it straight out of the mouth like no food for you. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2439.0s)]
*  You know, it's not no soup for you. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2444.0s)]
*  It's just no food for you. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2445.0s)]
*  Now, it's been a been a few weeks. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2447.0s)]
*  So, you know, I really don't think that the criticism by Hakeem is is deserved. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2449.0s)]
*  It's, you know, not like it's an everyday practice, just an occasional practice by some on the right to take the food, rip it out of the mouths of children. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2454.0s)]
*  So, yes, that there is a Sparty Junior for you, Sparty Junior. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2465.0s)]
*  You know, Hakeem Jeffries, he of the record Magic Minute, so proud of himself last week, where he outdid Kevin McCarthy and went with the longest Magic Minute in House history, trying to channel his inner Cory Booker. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2473.0s)]
*  And then the one big beautiful bill act passed the House. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2489.0s)]
*  Independence Day happened. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2494.0s)]
*  The law was signed and you got your massive tax cuts, which, by the way, I brought you the information on last week. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2496.0s)]
*  How much they mean to you, you and your household, likely thousands of dollars. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2502.0s)]
*  So congratulations to you as well. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2506.0s)]
*  Brian Mudd in for Mark Levin. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2509.0s)]
*  It is always a pleasure being here with you. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2511.0s)]
*  And I want to get into this hour. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2514.0s)]
*  American made jobs for Americans and also a little bit about what's going on with the tariff situation, too. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2517.0s)]
*  But some of the analysis that I ended up digging into coming out of last week's jobs report and then just the remarkable turnaround we've seen with immigration enforcement in this country as a result of it. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2524.0s)]
*  I do want to finish with where I ended the first hour. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2537.0s)]
*  It's worthy of a little more explanation. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2542.0s)]
*  So the NEA ditching the ADL. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2545.0s)]
*  Now, here you have the largest teachers union. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2548.0s)]
*  There's nothing redeeming that's come out of the National Education Association just about ever. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2551.0s)]
*  But certainly for decades now, as they have been the right at the top of the list of the problems in indoctrinating our kids. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2556.0s)]
*  But they really have taken it to a new low because once upon a time, there used to be this kind of almost political alliance between the ADL as the ADL historically from a political perspective anyway, had skewed left. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2565.0s)]
*  And certainly the NEA, where 99 percent of their political donations go to Democrats, they found some commonality there. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2580.0s)]
*  But anti-Semitism being what it is at the National Education Association, the ADL is just a bridge too far anymore. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2589.0s)]
*  And so today at the National Education Association's meeting, you had a vote that was taken as to whether ADL provided materials would still be part of what is disseminated throughout the NEA. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2597.0s)]
*  This was a statement by a delegate at today's meeting. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2617.0s)]
*  They said allowing the ADL to determine what constitutes anti-Semitism would be like allowing the fossil fuel industry to determine what constitutes climate change. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2624.0s)]
*  Now. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2636.0s)]
*  It would almost be as bad as like having an organization that donates 99 percent of its money to Democrats involved in the educating of your kids, right? [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2638.0s)]
*  See, what we have now seen is that anti-Semitism has been fully embraced by the NEA too. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2649.0s)]
*  And something that I have always mentioned and it is super, super important. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2656.0s)]
*  I know that there are some well-intentioned teachers that are members of these unions. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2662.0s)]
*  If you are a member of a teachers union, you're part of the problem too. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2669.0s)]
*  And I've heard all the excuses so many times over the years and everything else. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2674.0s)]
*  While there's so much pressure to do it and well, you know, there and you can come up with whatever the excuses. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2679.0s)]
*  If you are a member of one of these teachers unions, you're part of the problem too. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2685.0s)]
*  And now you are a member, if you're a member of the NEA of an anti-Semitic organization as well. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2691.0s)]
*  And you're paying for that aspect of things. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2699.0s)]
*  Just when you thought that the NEA couldn't reach potentially any new lows. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2702.0s)]
*  As we continue to see, people really stand up and out themselves for who and what they are. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2708.0s)]
*  Which, by the way, on that note, you know, one of the things that I think is pretty revealing about people generally, [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2714.0s)]
*  it's the reason the whole free Palestine thing caught on in the first place. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2723.0s)]
*  It's not exactly the cool thing to do in society. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2728.0s)]
*  The socially acceptable thing to do, especially in the leftist circles, to run out there with a Nazi emblem. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2731.0s)]
*  I mean, that is not a way even in radical leftist society to make a lot of friends. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2740.0s)]
*  But man, the moment that you break out the free Palestine stuff, I mean, you'll find all kinds of commonality there these days. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2745.0s)]
*  So a couple of things that were interesting on this note. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2754.0s)]
*  A couple recent surveys found that far more people are sympathetic to anti-Semitism than you might have known. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2757.0s)]
*  For example, an estimated 22 million Americans are right at 9 percent in surveys to pollsters. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2766.0s)]
*  So they are outright supportive of Nazis. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2773.0s)]
*  So you got nearly one in 10 people like, yeah, Nazi right here. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2776.0s)]
*  And the Anti-Defamation League recently found nearly a quarter or about 24 percent of Americans hold anti-Semitic views. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2782.0s)]
*  So that is really the reason the whole free Palestine thing caught on. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2792.0s)]
*  If you wonder why is it that the location that most of these people probably couldn't even find on a map [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2798.0s)]
*  For a country that doesn't exist, for a group of people that voted in a terrorist organization in Hamas to lead it, [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2806.0s)]
*  a group of people who after October 7th of 2023, 71 percent said that it was the right thing to do. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2815.0s)]
*  You didn't know that, by the way, because it's always portrayed that all the poor Palestinian people. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2826.0s)]
*  71 percent of Palestinians surveyed after October 7th said that it was the right thing to do. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2832.0s)]
*  There's just no way to spend the Palestinian thing to anything other than what it is. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2844.0s)]
*  It is a way to express anti-Semitism. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2847.0s)]
*  And you continue to see this happen in so many different facets of society today, including right now at the NEA. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2850.0s)]
*  Now, talk about some American-made jobs for actual Americans. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2858.0s)]
*  And so there's just jobs that are actually being added in this country now are actually going to Americans again. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2863.0s)]
*  Crazy stat for you. When I was working my way through this information over the past few days, [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2872.0s)]
*  this one surprised me even a bit. It's rare that I get really surprised when I'm doing some analysis. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2880.0s)]
*  But what percentage of jobs added in this country during the Biden administration do you think went to natural born citizens? [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2886.0s)]
*  OK, of all jobs added in the United States during the four years of Biden, what percentage went to national or natural born citizens? [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2895.0s)]
*  Do do do do do. 59 percent. That's it. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2906.0s)]
*  59 percent. Of jobs added in the United States actually went to foreign Americans. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2913.0s)]
*  Forty one percent of the jobs added during the four years of Biden went to foreign born persons. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2923.0s)]
*  Now, look, some of those jobs did go to legal immigrants. Some of those went to people that were on legit work visas, whatever. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2929.0s)]
*  An awful lot of those jobs went to people who didn't legally enter this country. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2937.0s)]
*  Or should I say those who gained the asylum system and the TPS system under a complicit administration to put hard numbers on it based on government data of 13.4 million jobs added under the Biden administration. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2942.0s)]
*  Seven point nine million went to Native American workers, not as in tribal Native Americans, but native born American workers. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2960.0s)]
*  Well, five and a half million went to foreign born workers of both the legal and predominantly illegal variety. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2970.0s)]
*  And actually, it's even more devastating than it sounds because most of the jobs were recovered from pandemic year lockdowns. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2979.0s)]
*  So in other words, what you had happening predominantly here is due to stupid covid lockdowns. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2990.0s)]
*  Yet all those Americans losing their jobs and then when jobs are coming back. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=2999.0s)]
*  They're being occupied by often asylum seekers, illegal immigrants. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3003.0s)]
*  Coming out of it. So what has happened through the first five plus months of the Trump administration? [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3012.0s)]
*  This is a pretty remarkable thing. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3019.0s)]
*  You've had nine hundred and eighty five thousand jobs added. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3022.0s)]
*  With a net decline of seven hundred and thirty five thousand foreign born workers. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3026.0s)]
*  OK, so that is a net change of over one point seven million Americans working already this year. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3032.0s)]
*  And that in and of itself is an incredible turnaround. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3041.0s)]
*  But there's another storyline that when you start to take a look at that jumps out. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3044.0s)]
*  So first in the real economy for the average American, the job market opportunities have been rapidly improving. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3052.0s)]
*  You know, the old excuse had always been that illegal immigrants, they do the jobs that Americans won't do. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3060.0s)]
*  Well, what the data show is that illegal immigrants were taking the jobs that Americans needed, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3066.0s)]
*  along with affordable housing and other government assistance programs, too. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3074.0s)]
*  But here's the thing that really kind of kicks this into the whole next level. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3080.0s)]
*  What's more is that the decline of seven hundred and thirty five thousand foreign born workers. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3085.0s)]
*  That is running way the heck ahead of detention and deportation numbers from the interior so far this year. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3090.0s)]
*  So that is where it starts to point in another direction as well. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3098.0s)]
*  We have seven hundred and thirty five thousand fewer foreign born workers when we're talking about. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3103.0s)]
*  Detention's deportations in the tens of thousands at this point from the interior. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3111.0s)]
*  What this also points to is that it is likely self deportation numbers are huge, absolutely huge. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3119.0s)]
*  I'll come back to that point next. I'm Brian Mudd. And for the great one, Mudd, hello Ben. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3129.0s)]
*  If you're with one of the big three wireless carriers, you're really overpaying for your service, period. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3142.0s)]
*  You're paying for thousands of retail stores you never go into. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3147.0s)]
*  You're paying for unnecessary perks you never use. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3152.0s)]
*  You're paying a massive premium for what you think is superior 5G service. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3155.0s)]
*  Guess what? PureTalk uses the same 5G network on the same 5G towers. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3160.0s)]
*  The only difference, they don't charge you for any of the garbage. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3165.0s)]
*  Instead, PureTalk gives you unlimited talk, text, plenty of data for just twenty five bucks a month. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3168.0s)]
*  Folks, that's less than half the price of the big guys during a time when saving a buck really matters. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3174.0s)]
*  I am a PureTalk customer. I have been for years. I made the switch. It's easy. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3179.0s)]
*  You can even keep your phone and your number. So do this. Go to puretalk.com slash Levin. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3185.0s)]
*  That's puretalk.com slash L-E-V-I-N. And you'll save an additional 50 percent off your first month. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3191.0s)]
*  You can switch over to PureTalk in as little as ten minutes. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3198.0s)]
*  That's puretalk.com slash Levin. L-E-V-I-N. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3202.0s)]
*  To switch to PureTalk, wireless by Americans for Americans. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3206.0s)]
*  I said over two months ago, if the rhetoric continues against ICE agents and mortgage [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3214.0s)]
*  agents about being compared to terrorists, like Congressman Jay Paul did, being compared to Nazis and [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3218.0s)]
*  racists, that it's going to end with the use of force that either a criminal is going to die or an officer is going to die. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3224.0s)]
*  I've seen this recipe before. I knew it was coming and I don't think it's over. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3230.0s)]
*  Borders are Tom Homan. And as we've come to learn with the targeting of ICE agents and Prairie Land, the Prairie [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3236.0s)]
*  Land Detention Facility in Texas on the Fourth of July, highly organized situation. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3246.0s)]
*  You had essentially military style tactics that were being used. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3254.0s)]
*  What looks like with these 11 perps, these 11 suspects, a diversion that was created to draw ICE officers out and then have snipers attack them. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3258.0s)]
*  Just a chilling situation. While at the same time, you now have Democrats in Congress calling for the doxing effectively of ICE. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3272.0s)]
*  It is straight out of rules for radicals what's going on here. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3282.0s)]
*  These people, if you are trying to get ICE officers killed, if you're trying to get border patrol agents killed, you wouldn't do anything differently than Democrats in Congress are doing. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3286.0s)]
*  And we're not just talking about the AOCs of the world. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3298.0s)]
*  We are not just talking about the radicals as they have commonly been identified in the House. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3303.0s)]
*  Now, you even have Spartan on this. You have Cory Booker, who's proposing legislation that would have ICE agents identified. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3313.0s)]
*  It truly is chilling what's going on there. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3322.0s)]
*  As we're talking about some of this immigration related stuff, I was just bringing you the information. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3326.0s)]
*  Remarkable. If you take a look at what happened during the four years of the Biden administration, where jobs in this country that were added, only 59 percent went to born Americans, while 41 percent of all the jobs added went to foreign born persons. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3332.0s)]
*  You take a look at what really was going on in this country with just the open borders, illegal immigration. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3354.0s)]
*  It wasn't just the inflation. It wasn't just the crime. It was also taking jobs, too. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3361.0s)]
*  And then you take a look at the remarkable turnaround, just what enforcing the law, enforcing our border again has done. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3367.0s)]
*  So in just over five months of the Trump administration, we have a net decline of 400, I'm sorry, 735,000 foreign born workers. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3375.0s)]
*  With 1.7 million Americans that have entered the workforce. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3388.0s)]
*  1.7 million American jobs added. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3396.0s)]
*  So it just goes to show there are so many people that were on the sidelines, so many Americans that were on the sidelines waiting for opportunities that are being taken by these illegal immigrants. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3401.0s)]
*  But the other thing that I mentioned is it really points in the direction of what are likely massive self deportation numbers. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3414.0s)]
*  Now, the thing with self deportations, we don't know what we don't know, right? [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3423.0s)]
*  I mean, if somebody just goes, we don't necessarily know that they were not here illegally now they're gone. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3427.0s)]
*  The only way we know is if they're using the CBP one home app, which you have doubtless come across the ads with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3436.0s)]
*  How she's saying, hey, you know, leave, go home, we will arrest you. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3448.0s)]
*  We it will not be pleasant or you go ahead and take advantage of the CBP one home app and we will go ahead and deport you and you get your little thousand dollar bonus and everything else to get on your way. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3452.0s)]
*  That is what we've been doing most recently. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3463.0s)]
*  Well, we only know of several thousand people who have done that so far. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3465.0s)]
*  But if you have seven hundred and thirty five thousand foreign born workers that have left the workforce, why did they suddenly do it? [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3470.0s)]
*  And where did they all of a sudden go? [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3477.0s)]
*  And that is what points to the self deportation aspect of the Trump administration's plans really starting to work to. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3479.0s)]
*  Brian Mudd in for Mark Levin. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3488.0s)]
*  If you're with one of the big three wireless carriers, you're really overpaying for your service period. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3490.0s)]

*  And you can call Mark at 877-381-3811. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3563.0s)]
*  This man was in his home and he was actually tampering with evidence when our officers went in with the FBI to be able to make this arrest. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3568.0s)]
*  And we find out that he's a green card holder. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3577.0s)]
*  He received DACA. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3579.0s)]
*  Yeah, so that is ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan talking about one of the conspirators in the attack on the Fourth of July in Texas on ICE officers. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3582.0s)]
*  So look at that. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3594.0s)]
*  Isn't it fun? [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3595.0s)]
*  We're talking about a DACA recipient where we're talking about a green card holder, just another warm and fluffy migrant, right? [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3596.0s)]
*  Just people that are here for great opportunities. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3603.0s)]
*  Brian Mudd in for Mark Levin and always a pleasure to be here with you broadcast live from my home station WJNO in West Palm Beach. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3606.0s)]

*  And I was just walking through some of what was pretty revealing with the most recent jobs numbers and the number of jobs that went to. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3624.0s)]
*  Foreigners under the Biden administration. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3637.0s)]
*  Forty one percent of all jobs added remarkably. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3641.0s)]
*  What we have seen so far this year where there is actually a significant decline in the number of foreign born workers while we've had a significant gain in overall jobs. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3644.0s)]
*  So that has been completely turned around. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3654.0s)]
*  But of course, the other thing that we are certainly seeing turned around pretty remarkably as well are crime statistics. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3656.0s)]
*  And no surprise here either. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3664.0s)]
*  You know, this is something that I have covered for years and something that I've updated from time to time while guesting for for Mark on this show. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3666.0s)]
*  And we take a look at what we have seen so far this year. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3677.0s)]
*  You know, attempted border crossings are down 93 percent access, sexual access into the United States is down by 99 percent. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3681.0s)]
*  The CBP one home app that was used by the Biden administration to fly nearly a million illegal immigrants into the United States, of course, now being used to fly illegal immigrants out of the United States. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3690.0s)]
*  On that note, ISIS daily detentions are up 53 percent over a year ago. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3703.0s)]
*  And surprise, surprise as detentions have risen. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3710.0s)]
*  As deportations have ensued and including what appear to be large numbers of self deportations as the Trump administration's plan to tell people to self deport seems to be working and probably better than than many new. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3713.0s)]
*  We see crime is falling rapidly. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3729.0s)]
*  To give you a little bit of this homicides, they're down by 21 percent so far this year. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3734.0s)]
*  Robberies. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3742.0s)]
*  They are to property crimes 16 percent lower so far this year. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3744.0s)]
*  Violent crime in general. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3749.0s)]
*  Down by 11 percent, too. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3752.0s)]
*  And the biggest impact, it's often in the biggest cities that have had some of the most pervasive illegal immigration populations like Denver and Aurora, Colorado, for example. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3754.0s)]
*  And of course, this is of absolutely no surprise. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3767.0s)]
*  If you've been following this stuff closely. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3771.0s)]
*  You know, I. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3773.0s)]
*  This is some of the information I brought you non citizen crime. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3775.0s)]
*  Last year. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3779.0s)]
*  Just incredible how much of it was accounted for. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3781.0s)]
*  When you take a look at drug trafficking, property crimes, fraud, we got to the point last year where 24 percent of all drug trafficking in the United States was happening with non citizens. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3786.0s)]
*  You had right out a quarter of all property crime that was happening with non citizens. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3801.0s)]
*  And this is what was just so frustrating to no end. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3807.0s)]
*  It's like who wouldn't want to get rid of a quarter of all property crime? [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3811.0s)]
*  Who wouldn't want to get rid of close to a quarter of all drug trafficking? [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3815.0s)]
*  Unless you're a user, you know, Hunter and his friends. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3820.0s)]
*  Twenty eight percent of fraud. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3825.0s)]
*  Twenty eight percent of fraud. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3827.0s)]
*  Who wouldn't want to get rid of twenty eight percent of fraud? [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3829.0s)]
*  All you had to do is get rid of the illegal immigrants. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3831.0s)]
*  They were responsible for that kind of percentage of them. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3836.0s)]
*  And it got to the point in the lights had been so pervasive, they've been thrown out there for decades. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3840.0s)]
*  You still have people on the left that will say, oh, these these poor, warm, warm and fluffy migrants. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3846.0s)]
*  You know, the ones that would sidle up to border patrol agents during the Biden administration, [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3852.0s)]
*  go, hey, I see this where I see a seldom. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3857.0s)]
*  And then the beaten down border patrol agent would go, oh, another magic a word people. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3863.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, where do you want to go? [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3868.0s)]
*  You know, a five star in Manhattan. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3870.0s)]
*  Well, only the best for you. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3873.0s)]
*  You know, taxpayer expense. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3875.0s)]
*  That kind of thing would happen. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3877.0s)]
*  So anyway, you know, we were always told that, oh, Americans are more likely to commit crimes than than these warm and fluffy migrants. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3879.0s)]
*  You know, they just want a better life and everything. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3887.0s)]
*  Yeah. We had gotten to the point where non-citizen crime rates. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3889.0s)]
*  Had become nine hundred and fourteen percent higher. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3894.0s)]
*  Then the legal citizen. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3898.0s)]
*  So, yeah, you were. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3900.0s)]
*  Not nearly as likely as the warm and fluffy migrants. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3904.0s)]
*  You know, the warm and fluffy asylum seeker. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3907.0s)]
*  To to get involved in nefarious activities. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3910.0s)]
*  More than nine times more likely by the end of the Biden administration. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3915.0s)]
*  And by the way, total crimes, you throw the whole kit, caboodle together. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3920.0s)]
*  Total crimes committed by non-citizens under the Biden administration during those four years were up. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3924.0s)]
*  By six hundred and twenty six percent. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3932.0s)]
*  And so it just is such a stunning thing to have seen. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3935.0s)]
*  And so it's no surprise that as we are making early progress, we are seeing a dramatic decline in crime rates as well. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3939.0s)]
*  And so so many things that are improving from the labor market. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3948.0s)]
*  By the way, the another thing that you're going to end up seeing with that, too, is wages. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3951.0s)]
*  By the way, that's already happening. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3955.0s)]
*  If you take a look at the inflation rate, which at two point four percent right now is the lowest that it has been since President Trump was one month old. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3957.0s)]
*  Out of office the last time. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3965.0s)]
*  And if you take a look at the wage growth, it is almost two percent higher than that. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3967.0s)]
*  It is the highest increase in the quality of life most recently that we have seen for the average family since Trump was present the last time. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3971.0s)]
*  And that's only going to continue to improve going forward, because the other thing that came into play with so many illegal immigrants that were occupying jobs is that, you know, it had a negative impact on wages, especially for, you know, [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3980.0s)]
*  Americans that either were locked out of the workforce or they were competing at lower wage levels. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=3993.0s)]
*  So there's so many different things that go into this. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4000.0s)]
*  So, so important. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4003.0s)]
*  All right, let's go to author Arthur in New Jersey. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4005.0s)]
*  Welcome to the show. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4010.0s)]
*  Hey, how you doing? [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4013.0s)]
*  The question really is, you know, for the past 25 years, I've always said, and we need an amendment for immigration. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4015.0s)]
*  We need to set it at zero. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4023.0s)]
*  Set the send the military and the National Guard around the center, some mailer, you know, to do it and send everybody back home. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4026.0s)]
*  And then once we get forensic accounts that are not linked to any corruption to set a budget, because I don't trust people in D.C. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4034.0s)]
*  They can't even do their own personal budgeting. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4043.0s)]
*  You know, and then we reopen the doors at a rate commiserate to the birthrate death rate and attrition rate. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4045.0s)]
*  But the question I have is, I know illegal immigrants that I've met who have fake Social Security numbers. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4052.0s)]
*  What is there any numbers to say? [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4059.0s)]
*  Of course, obviously they don't get their tax refund because it's fake. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4061.0s)]
*  Where does that money that the employers are putting in to the system go? [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4065.0s)]
*  OK, so a couple of points on that. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4070.0s)]
*  The first thing is that the Biden administration did issue just over two million Social Security numbers to people who were noncitizens that were likely illegal immigrants. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4072.0s)]
*  This is a whole other part of piece of analysis that I could go down, but actually just completed it earlier this afternoon. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4087.0s)]
*  It was what percentage of asylum seekers most recently? [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4096.0s)]
*  You know, the people that actually went all the way through the legal process over the past year, there are approximately one point three million of them. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4101.0s)]
*  How many asylum seekers actually turned out to be legitimate? [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4108.0s)]
*  How many at the end of the legal process to the court say, judge say, yeah, you're a legitimate asylum seeker. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4113.0s)]
*  You say and the answer is 12 percent. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4119.0s)]
*  OK, so 88 percent of the people that came across that were seeking asylum or nothing more than common illegal immigrants with what we had found most recently. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4122.0s)]
*  So what happened in many of these instances is that the Biden administration taking asylum seekers or taking those that were being granted TPS, temporary protected status that they were always trying to turn permanent, and they were giving them Social Security numbers. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4132.0s)]
*  And so that was a part of the legitimization here. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4148.0s)]
*  And at that point, it wasn't even like a fraudulent thing. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4152.0s)]
*  Now, when you're talking about a fraudulent Social Security number and you're engaging in Social Security fraud, you know, that's a different situation altogether. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4155.0s)]
*  You know, you're talking about a criminal matter. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4164.0s)]
*  And in terms of, you know, the eventual outcome there, you know, that's that's a good question. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4167.0s)]
*  What I can tell you, and this has always been one of the arguments is, well, you know, they pay taxes and everything else. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4173.0s)]
*  Well, not nearly relative to the amount of benefits they receive. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4180.0s)]
*  And what we have seen historically is that the majority of not just asylum seekers, not just those on TPS, but just outright illegal immigrants because we had non-government organizations that are involved in helping get illegal immigrants onto government assistance programs, using up all the affordable housing, getting them on on snapchat. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4185.0s)]
*  Obviously, kids that were using schools and everything else, you would have well over half of all illegal immigrants on government assistance programs. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4210.0s)]
*  And so the net costs there does an analysis on this every year. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4220.0s)]
*  And we also had a congressional investigation take place. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4225.0s)]
*  And you put the information together last year, factoring in how much was paid into the system by non-citizens. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4229.0s)]
*  The net cost to this country for them to be here. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4238.0s)]
*  A hundred and eighty two billion dollars. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4243.0s)]
*  So for everything they paid into the system relative to everything they took out of it through all these assistance programs, not even factoring in crime that I was talking about the the jobs that were taken from from Americans. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4246.0s)]
*  A hundred and eighty two billion dollars in net expense to us as taxpayers or to you as a federal taxpayer. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4262.0s)]
*  The hard cost for us to facilitate the illegal immigration last year. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4270.0s)]
*  One thousand three hundred and fifty two dollars. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4274.0s)]
*  So that ends up on an annualized basis being your burden for the run rate of illegal immigration that we had under the Biden administration. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4277.0s)]
*  Let's go to Tony in New Jersey. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4286.0s)]
*  Tony, welcome to the show. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4289.0s)]
*  Hi, Brian Mudd. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4292.0s)]
*  I love your topic on self deporting. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4294.0s)]
*  And I've been thinking about all the troublemakers who are serving in the Democratic Party in leadership and big leadership spots. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4297.0s)]
*  Who are sabotaging all the all the, you know, illegal immigration efforts that we're working on, putting everyone in danger and plus inciting everyone to riot, etc. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4305.0s)]
*  And President Trump has been talking about this. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4317.0s)]
*  You know, we might be able to come up with a way a way for him to do it because we have leadership that's in the city. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4320.0s)]
*  These blue cities that are sanctuary cities that need to be self deported. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4327.0s)]
*  And the numbers are stunning that you gave us. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4332.0s)]
*  I mean, look at all the success we would have in our country if the troublemakers in these parties were gone. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4336.0s)]
*  And I'm trying to figure out a way to do it. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4342.0s)]
*  And I think when President Trump says if he has trouble in D.C. or New York, something might happen where the federal government might need to lean in a bit. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4344.0s)]
*  And I think that's the time for them to say, fill out your self deportation application and get out of your job if you don't want to be prosecuted because you have caused the city so much danger and hardship and money by your blue city activities. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4354.0s)]
*  We're going to give you that same chance. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4370.0s)]
*  What do you think about that, Brian? [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4372.0s)]
*  Yeah, Tony, I appreciate the call and I appreciate your passion and also the frustration you have for this situation. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4374.0s)]
*  One of the things that I think you are going to start to see and you already have, I mean, we started to see last election is that you're not going to have the same political will for this to continue anymore. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4380.0s)]
*  I mean, obviously, illegal immigration was a cornerstone of Trump's win last year. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4392.0s)]
*  But when you take a look at what's happened and specifically, you know, a lot of the inner city constituencies that have elected these leftist politicians that have allowed for the protection, the facilitation at the point where you're going to see the election. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4397.0s)]
*  The point where inner cities no longer make it comfortable for illegal immigrants to hang out, to take jobs, to commit crime, to do things, then it's a different ballgame. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4410.0s)]
*  And that in and of itself helps the seaport self deportation angle. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4420.0s)]
*  And we are seeing the highest levels of Hispanics. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4424.0s)]
*  But, you know, in the last election, black voters, you had Trump get the highest percentage since 1960 for a Republican presidential candidate. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4427.0s)]
*  And you take a look at Hispanic support. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4436.0s)]
*  You had to go back to Bush in 2000 to find the last time that you had a Republican presidential candidate that did as well with Hispanics. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4438.0s)]
*  And if you take a look in real time, the numbers are looking even stronger than they were last November. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4447.0s)]
*  So I actually think that you could see this happening from the grassroots level, forcing the hand of some of these left wing politicians and some of these blue cities. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4453.0s)]
*  That is my hope. But a good call. Appreciate it. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4462.0s)]
*  Brian Mudd in for the great one. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4465.0s)]
*  Mudd, love in. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4467.0s)]
*  If you're with one of the big three wireless carriers, you're really overpaying for your service, period. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4475.0s)]

*  These ICE officers are serving the American people, putting the American people first. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4545.0s)]
*  And the Democrats want to go after their families and their kids and dox them and make sure that they're unsafe. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4550.0s)]
*  Again, this ICE deputy director, Madison Sheahan, and the visible act is what has been proposed by a Sparty Jr. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4555.0s)]
*  Cory Booker and company. Just remarkable. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4565.0s)]
*  And again, if you were trying to get ICE agents killed and as she points out, families too. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4571.0s)]
*  Would you do anything different than they're proposing here? [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4579.0s)]
*  If this visible act were to become law, you would have ICE agents identified. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4583.0s)]
*  What's going to happen then? [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4591.0s)]
*  It is disturbing on a level that is hard to comprehend for anybody who wants to be taken as a serious person. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4594.0s)]
*  What you have being proposed here is straight out of rules for radicals. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4604.0s)]
*  Or I suppose you could also just take a more modern look at it with American Marxism. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4609.0s)]
*  This is ultimately what Mark is talking about. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4618.0s)]
*  Does it by any means necessary, whatever the tactics have to be to achieve a desired outcome? [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4622.0s)]
*  Can you imagine if these people actually have their way? [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4629.0s)]
*  You know, one of the things that is terrifying to me is the ebb and flow in politics. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4633.0s)]
*  You know, there could be a day, history says there likely will be a day where Democrats have complete control of the federal government again. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4638.0s)]
*  What happens? [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4647.0s)]
*  What happens when you have a party that literally wants to pass policy that would identify ICE officers? [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4649.0s)]
*  I mean, you're obviously trying to intimidate first and foremost any good people from wanting to be in ICE. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4661.0s)]
*  In the here and now, that is one of the implications behind this. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4668.0s)]
*  And try to keep good people from getting involved in the first place, scare the ones that are there, [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4673.0s)]
*  they're going to keep their jobs from actually trying to do their jobs. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4678.0s)]
*  But the chilling effect it has in addition to their open border policies, I mean, it truly is the destruction of this country if they end up having their way. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4681.0s)]
*  It is a scary thing to think about. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4691.0s)]
*  It's why it's so important that we educate and win. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4694.0s)]
*  I'm Brian Mudd. And for The Great One, Mark Lovett. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4697.0s)]
*  He's here. He's here. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4703.0s)]
*  Now, broadcasting from the underground command post, deep in the bowels of a hidden bunker, [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4707.0s)]
*  somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building, we once again make contact with our leader, Mark Lovett. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4713.0s)]
*  California? [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4726.0s)]
*  We're on the receiving end. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4729.0s)]
*  Of most of the assault on Trump and Trump. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4732.0s)]
*  I was here a year ago talking about the fact that the president of the United States, or at least former president that was running again, [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4734.0s)]
*  who wanted to put America in reverse, wanted to bring us back to a pre-1960s world. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4741.0s)]
*  On voting rights, civil rights, LGBTQ rights, on women's rights, not just access to abortion, but access to contraceptive care. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4746.0s)]
*  I guess it's like a rite of passage that if you are a Democrat wannabe, you have got to be on the record in front of some black people saying, [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4754.0s)]
*  and Trump wants to put you back in chains. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4766.0s)]
*  It's like the prerequisite. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4769.0s)]
*  There are so many things that are really weird and quite awkward about Gavin Newsom in South Carolina generally. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4771.0s)]
*  I mean, one, the slickster, the hair, Gavin Newsom, just in the state of South Carolina. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4779.0s)]
*  I mean, it's like these two things. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4786.0s)]
*  One is not like the other. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4788.0s)]
*  The next thing is Gavin hanging out with some black folk in South Carolina. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4790.0s)]
*  So it's not just we're got to put in the optics. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4794.0s)]
*  If you're wondering, by the way, what seems to be taking place? [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4797.0s)]
*  Why would Gavin Newsom on July 9th of 2025 be in South Carolina? [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4801.0s)]
*  You want to talk about a desperate man who's on the campaign trail. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4811.0s)]
*  I was actually just telling Mr. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4815.0s)]
*  Producer, it's like what goes on that you're in South Carolina evidently campaigning for president already. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4817.0s)]
*  The one thing that I guess you're going to try to share up the James Clyburn vote. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4826.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, let's be real. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4831.0s)]
*  The only reason that Biden ended up becoming president, the only reason he won the Democrat primary, he was on the ropes, was because Clyburn came in, gave him the blessing. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4833.0s)]
*  He got the black vote in South Carolina that turned things around. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4843.0s)]
*  And so I guess the hair is rushing into South Carolina to try to get the Clyburn endorsement a before any other Democrat want to be. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4848.0s)]
*  And secondarily, I don't know Casey is in around by the time that we're actually into the Democrat primary for the twenty twenty eight presidential. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4859.0s)]
*  It's a weird thing when you get desperate people doing desperate things. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4868.0s)]
*  But yes, we did have the the requisite. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4873.0s)]
*  They want to take you back to a pre civil rights here. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4876.0s)]
*  They want to put you in chains. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4880.0s)]
*  OK, Gavin, why isn't that happening right now? [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4882.0s)]
*  Why did Trump actually win the highest percentage of the black vote? [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4886.0s)]
*  Since 1960, since you're talking about 1960. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4891.0s)]
*  Why is it that we actually are seeing blacks benefit more in the early going from the Trump presidency than any other constituency, any other demographic? [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4895.0s)]
*  So I was talking about the jobs numbers in the previous hour, jobs that were taken by illegal immigrants gets who's benefiting the most from those jobs that are coming back to Americans. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4909.0s)]
*  And guess which demographic benefited the most during the first Trump presidency? [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4920.0s)]
*  That's right. The greatest upward mobility of any demographic happened for. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4926.0s)]
*  Blacks, Hispanic second. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4932.0s)]
*  Interesting thing is we had the lowest unemployment rates and highest gains for minority groups during the first Trump presidency pre covid. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4934.0s)]
*  So I mean, minor details in all of these things. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4945.0s)]
*  I mean, the one thing you got to see for Gavin, though, as awkward as the whole situation in South Carolina is he still is nowhere near like, you know, Hillary does Selma, you know, I in no way is tired thing, you know, putting on the whole. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4948.0s)]
*  At least he didn't try and accent. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4961.0s)]
*  So he's got that going for him and and Clyburn not offering a full throttled endorsements, but saying he likes Gavin's chances. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4963.0s)]
*  I'm not sure of what, but he likes Kevin's chances. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4972.0s)]
*  I these people, I will tell you something that President Trump has done that does take us back to the pre 1960s. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4976.0s)]
*  What we have seen at this point. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4985.0s)]
*  The second most efficient president in U.S. history. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4990.0s)]
*  The second most efficient president in U.S. history. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4993.0s)]
*  Now a couple things. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=4998.0s)]
*  Friday's Independence Day was unlike any other in American history, right? [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5000.0s)]
*  For a lot of reasons. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5007.0s)]
*  And that's because the BBB, of course, delivered to President Trump, allowing him to effectively accomplish his second term legislative agenda in fewer than six months on the job. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5010.0s)]
*  Not bad. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5019.0s)]
*  You know, you consider that his signature legislation in his first term, the tax cut jobs app that was just made permanent. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5020.0s)]
*  He can get that until December of his first year in the presidency. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5028.0s)]
*  And actually, he had wider margins in Congress in 2017 than he did this time around, which is also that much more impressive. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5033.0s)]
*  But when you take a look at what he has actually accomplished so far. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5043.0s)]
*  Fewer than six months on the job. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5046.0s)]
*  OK, so he's been president for a gov 169 170 days now. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5049.0s)]
*  During that time, he signed 170 executive orders. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5056.0s)]
*  By the way, he has signed eight more executive orders already. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5061.0s)]
*  Then Joe Biden, dementia Joe and team auto pen, then Joe and all the auto pens out there. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5068.0s)]
*  Combined and for you pretty remarkable. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5074.0s)]
*  I mean, he has been prolific. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5076.0s)]
*  He signed 44 presidential memoranda, 71 presidential proclamations, and he has five laws, including, of course, the act that was formerly known as the one big beautiful bill. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5079.0s)]
*  And to put this into context, we talk about going back to the pre 1960s. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5094.0s)]
*  The only other president in American history to enact more of his agenda more efficiently than President Trump. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5100.0s)]
*  Know who it is? [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5109.0s)]
*  Answer is FDR. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5111.0s)]
*  FDR, who came into his presidency, of course, during the Great Depression, had the New Deal passed within his first week on the job. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5113.0s)]
*  Issued a slew of executive actions around it within his first 100 days. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5123.0s)]
*  So other than FDR, no president, not even Washington, has worked as quickly or as efficiently to achieve their policies. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5126.0s)]
*  You know, there's so many different ways you got to take a look at what happened here. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5136.0s)]
*  There's no way to claw back the damage that was done during Biden's four years. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5140.0s)]
*  Right. I mean, there's no way to take back the historically high inflation. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5147.0s)]
*  There's no way at this point just to magically take back the illegal immigration crisis. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5152.0s)]
*  But when you take a look at giving President Trump those four years to reset, to find the right people to surround himself with, to work on his agenda. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5160.0s)]
*  And then just hit the ground running. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5175.0s)]
*  In many ways, Democrats are in a much worse situation politically because of this. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5178.0s)]
*  Giving him the time is the one thing about Trump. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5186.0s)]
*  He's made mistakes. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5189.0s)]
*  This is true in his personal life, his political life. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5191.0s)]
*  He's made mistakes. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5193.0s)]
*  He's suffered losses, sometimes big. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5194.0s)]
*  He always comes back more successfully than he ever was before. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5196.0s)]
*  This is what he does. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5201.0s)]
*  He learns from the mistakes and he has greater success every time. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5202.0s)]
*  And that is absolutely what we've seen and what we are now benefiting from in a pretty remarkable way, very quickly. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5208.0s)]
*  And when you take a look at the level of speed with which he has been able to accomplish his agenda, it's even more remarkable when you consider, of course, the extent to which the legal system is still in place. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5217.0s)]
*  The legal system has been stacked against him. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5232.0s)]
*  The amount of times that the Supreme Court has had to weigh in. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5234.0s)]
*  It just continues to be an ongoing deal. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5238.0s)]
*  But also the Congress. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5242.0s)]
*  You know, you take a look at this Congress. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5244.0s)]
*  This is the most narrow governing majority by a single party in U.S. history. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5247.0s)]
*  In other words, when you have single party control, the federal government, it has never been more narrow. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5253.0s)]
*  Then it is right now. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5261.0s)]
*  And yet Trump was able to navigate that and has been able to navigate that as successfully as he has to achieve his agenda. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5263.0s)]
*  The second fastest of any president in American history. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5272.0s)]
*  And when you compare that to FDR, you know, the one who did it quicker. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5276.0s)]
*  I mean, look, he had it his way. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5281.0s)]
*  You know, he was in and like was a Big Mac territory. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5283.0s)]
*  Have it have it or that's a no, that's BK. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5287.0s)]
*  That's Burger King. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5289.0s)]
*  So, yeah, have it your way. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5290.0s)]
*  Right. So you had FDR with Democrats occupying 70 percent of congressional seats when he became president in 1933. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5291.0s)]
*  So you have you have Trump doing it with with barely any majority. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5301.0s)]
*  FDR had everything. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5305.0s)]
*  That's why he was able to move so quick. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5306.0s)]
*  So what we are, you know, seeing what has happened, what's been culminating with the signing of the BBB hasn't just been history in the making. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5308.0s)]
*  But arguably the most effective and impressive start to a presidency in American history, when you take a look at the political makeup in Washington, D.C. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5317.0s)]
*  And one of the big things is that the BBB is already saving you money. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5330.0s)]
*  You know, one of the big questions I touched on this when I was with you last week, but continue to get a ton of questions around this, like how is this working? [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5335.0s)]
*  When do the tax cuts come kick in? [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5344.0s)]
*  When am I going to be saving money? [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5347.0s)]
*  And the answer is easy. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5349.0s)]
*  You are already saving money right now. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5352.0s)]
*  In fact, you actually have been saving money since January 1st, as the case happens to be. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5355.0s)]
*  So. In all, at least by my count, there are twenty seven different changes to various categories of IRS things that impact personal taxes. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5362.0s)]
*  So in other words. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5378.0s)]
*  The changes impact almost every tax filer. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5380.0s)]
*  And what this almost certainly means is lower taxes for you and better still, almost all of the tax changes made retroactive to January 1st, meaning that you are saving on your taxes and you're going to rent them, realize the benefit all throughout the course of this year. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5383.0s)]
*  And the key to understanding the additional Trump tax cuts, you know, the big ones that people pay attention to tips over time, Social Security, auto loans, child tax credits, you name it, is understanding what the new deductions in tax credits mean to you. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5400.0s)]
*  And one of the things that can come into play here like you might be helpful if you have a person who helps you with taxes. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5416.0s)]
*  Take a look at your situation and see what exactly this means to you because there's a lot of extra dough that you might be doing out of Tunkle Sam right now that you may not need to. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5423.0s)]
*  You know, a lot of people are probably not going to realize what this means to them until the next tax day. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5433.0s)]
*  More knows Democrats are lying about this all kinds of ways. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5438.0s)]
*  And one of the reasons, you know, one of the questions that came up is why are all these deductions in play? [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5442.0s)]
*  Like, for example, somebody was saying, oh, you know, it's a big lie about there being no tax on Social Security and tips and everything because it's like a deduction or something. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5448.0s)]
*  Well, there's a reason for it. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5457.0s)]
*  It came down to the Senate parliamentarian and the use of the reconciliation process. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5459.0s)]
*  If there had been just like an outright elimination of taxation in all of these different areas, the parliamentarian was saying that that would be a violation of Senate rules. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5464.0s)]
*  And it would require 60 votes in the Senate or as I was pleading on the show last Monday, JD Vance to overrule the Senate parliamentarian on some things. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5474.0s)]
*  But nevertheless, the use of deductions achieves the same effect. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5484.0s)]
*  But it was a way to get around the Senate parliamentarian saying that, hey, like if you just outright eliminate Social Security taxes, that is is a structural change that requires, you know, the full 60 votes in the Senate. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5489.0s)]
*  So that is why things were structured the way they were. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5503.0s)]
*  But I want to pick up on just a couple things that are useful to you right now, as you are already in the process of saving some money, even if you haven't realized the extent of it yet. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5506.0s)]
*  I'm Brian Mudd and for the Great One. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5516.0s)]
*  Mudd, Love N. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5518.0s)]
*  This law will create create havoc wreak havoc on our country and hurt American families across the nation. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5534.0s)]
*  Millions will lose health care. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5542.0s)]
*  Millions more will see their premiums skyrocket. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5543.0s)]
*  Utility bills will rise. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5545.0s)]
*  And these people, it just it's hilarious. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5549.0s)]
*  You know, I've always had this saying, Brian Mudd in for Mark Levin, you can lie to people about what policy will do and those that are inclined to believe you. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5553.0s)]
*  And at this point, I'm not even sure that a lot of Democrats believe Chuck Schumer. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5563.0s)]
*  It's just that, OK, well, I have TDS and you say that Trump is the bad man who's going to kill people. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5568.0s)]
*  So yeah, you but you can lie to people about policy. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5574.0s)]
*  What did it will do? [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5579.0s)]
*  And those who are inclined to believe you will. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5581.0s)]
*  But you can't lie to people about what is or isn't in their wallet because they know. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5583.0s)]
*  Right. And this was the lesson of the first Trump tax cuts. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5588.0s)]
*  The ones that were just made permanent under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5592.0s)]
*  It was so bad. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5597.0s)]
*  I remember there was some polling after the tax cuts had already kicked in. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5598.0s)]
*  People had been lied to so successfully by your godless, soulless and slanderous news media and by leftist politicians, of course, working in conjunction with one another. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5603.0s)]
*  And people evidently were still able to be manipulated to that extent back in 2018 by by the left. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5614.0s)]
*  But we had the tax cuts that already kicked started to kick in. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5621.0s)]
*  Wall Street Journal, NBC poll showed only 18 percent of Americans believe they were receiving a tax benefit when the actual number was over 80 percent at that point. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5625.0s)]
*  It just a remarkable thing. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5637.0s)]
*  So what ultimately does the BBB mean to you? [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5639.0s)]
*  I'm just going to break it out in a few different areas real quick. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5643.0s)]
*  And I went through some analysis on this when I was with you last week. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5647.0s)]
*  Per tax filer, per tax filer. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5651.0s)]
*  If you are in thirty five thousand dollars or less, the average tax savings is an additional six hundred and fifty dollars. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5655.0s)]
*  All right. So you got your your tax cut from the Tax Cut Jobs Act plus an additional six hundred and fifty dollars per year in your pocket from this. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5664.0s)]
*  You earn between thirty five to fifty thousand. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5673.0s)]
*  Your average additional savings is fourteen hundred and fifty dollars. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5677.0s)]
*  Now, again, this is per filer. So if you are married, both working, filing jointly these income levels, you're going to see twice that benefit. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5683.0s)]
*  If you are in between fifty to one hundred and thousand dollars, the average benefit per filer is jumping up to seventeen hundred and fifty dollars. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5694.0s)]
*  And so you continue to see where this equals thousands of dollars for the average family. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5705.0s)]
*  You have a married couple, both working, typical family average income. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5711.0s)]
*  You start to see how you're going to have about thirty six hundred dollars in savings on average. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5716.0s)]
*  Now, the key in this, again, is that it's mostly being handled through deductions on your taxes. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5724.0s)]
*  And this is where one of the ways that you should be looking at this right now is going, hold on, rather than providing an interest free loan to the government all year. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5732.0s)]
*  One of the things I could do is have less tax taken out of my paycheck, less federal withholding. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5741.0s)]
*  That's where maybe talking to a person you work with on preparing your taxes could be good. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5746.0s)]
*  Not having as much taken out throughout the year. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5751.0s)]
*  That way, you might be able to see the benefit of these tax cuts as soon as your next paycheck. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5753.0s)]
*  It's one of the best things that a lot of people could be doing right now. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5759.0s)]
*  But savings, it's real. It's coming to you. Enjoy. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5762.0s)]
*  Brian Mudd in for Mark Levin. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5766.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, just there is there is nothing that's off limits in terms of just saying just the most outrageous things. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5790.0s)]
*  Brian Mudd in for Mark Levin. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5800.0s)]
*  And as the late great Rush Limbaugh would have said, good old Chuck U. Schumer right there as he just no shame. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5803.0s)]
*  They're going to kill you. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5814.0s)]
*  The one big beautiful bill act is literally going to kill people. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5816.0s)]
*  And again, as far as the whole no health care thing, I mean, in the grand scheme of things that just I mean, you have lies and then you have things that just hit me in all the right places. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5819.0s)]
*  I talked about the work requirements with Medicaid. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5835.0s)]
*  This is what they're talking about. People are going to lose health care. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5839.0s)]
*  The only people losing health care are slugs of the earth who don't deserve to get a single cent from any American taxpayer. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5842.0s)]
*  The only people who are losing Medicaid are absolute slug scumbag turds that won't get off their lazy butt. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5853.0s)]
*  Stop eating their bonbons also paid for by you and me off their couch. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5865.0s)]
*  Because the only thing that is being kicked off of Medicaid are lazy slugs. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5870.0s)]
*  My slogan has been just say no to slugs. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5879.0s)]
*  You have Schumer that is pro slug. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5885.0s)]
*  Because to keep Medicaid aside from all kinds of exemptions, including people that are disabled, people that are pregnant, people that are caretaker. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5889.0s)]
*  I mean, the exemptions. There are many. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5904.0s)]
*  The only thing you have to do to keep Medicaid is find 20 hours a week on average to do anything constructive with your life. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5908.0s)]
*  Anything. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5920.0s)]
*  You could work 20 hours a week. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5923.0s)]
*  You could pretend like you're trying to get a job 20 hours a week. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5926.0s)]
*  You could volunteer. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5932.0s)]
*  For 20 hours a week. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5935.0s)]
*  There are any number of different opportunities, just 20 hours a week, anything. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5940.0s)]
*  Just try to get your lazy butt off your freaking couch for 20 hours a week and you can keep your Medicaid. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5945.0s)]
*  Those are the only people losing it. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5954.0s)]
*  If they die, it's because they are the laziest scumbag slugs that wouldn't get their butts off of the couch and they ate too many bonbons at our taxpayer expense. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5956.0s)]
*  So they're going to kill themselves anyway, through the bonbon situation. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5969.0s)]
*  Just say no to slugs. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5975.0s)]
*  So Schumer and the Democrats, as they talk about killing people, losing health care, are pro slugs. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5977.0s)]
*  They are special, special people. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5985.0s)]
*  And also, you know, I think the real campaign here should be that they are anti-volunteerism as well. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=5993.0s)]
*  They don't even want these people to volunteer, help other people, help the impoverished folks who might could use their assistance for 20 hours a week. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6000.0s)]
*  Anyway, just special. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6014.0s)]
*  By the way, Brian Mudd with you. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6017.0s)]
*  I am always, always very pleased. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6019.0s)]
*  It's a true pleasure to be here with you. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6023.0s)]
*  I broadcast from my home station WJNO in West Palm Beach. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6026.0s)]
*  You can always catch me socially at Brian Mudd Radio. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6030.0s)]
*  Check out the Brian Mudd Show podcast wherever it is that you get your podcasts. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6033.0s)]
*  We've been talking about the BBB and how it's not likely to kill you. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6039.0s)]
*  But it is actually likely to save you a whole heck of a lot of money. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6042.0s)]
*  I do want to say we've got Kenneth. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6045.0s)]
*  Kenneth is in Virginia and he wants to talk about no tax on tips. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6047.0s)]
*  Kenneth, welcome to the show. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6052.0s)]
*  How are you doing? [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6055.0s)]
*  Very well. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6057.0s)]
*  Hey, it's really not about tips. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6058.0s)]
*  My main beef is all three of the things, the tips, the overtime and the social security. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6060.0s)]
*  And I see these things and you're against lies too. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6066.0s)]
*  But we get a $6,000 deduction if we make less than $75,000. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6070.0s)]
*  But that just, you know, gives you whatever your marginal tax rate. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6075.0s)]
*  Say if it's 20% and six, you get $1,200. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6080.0s)]
*  It does not eliminate. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6084.0s)]
*  Like I make $36,000 on social security. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6086.0s)]
*  I would have to have a deduction of $36,000 in order for that to be true. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6088.0s)]
*  Do you follow me? [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6094.0s)]
*  I follow you and I also am extremely well aware of all the deduction situations that go into this. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6097.0s)]
*  So I'm curious to know where it is you're going with this. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6103.0s)]
*  Well, you know, you said that we achieved the same thing by the $6,000 deduction. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6107.0s)]
*  Is it really well? [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6114.0s)]
*  Actually, I didn't say specifically social security in the $6,000 deduction. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6116.0s)]
*  But the tax savings in this is achieved through deductions. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6121.0s)]
*  And I explained that the reason that this was done was due to the Senate parliamentarian saying that under Senate rules, [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6126.0s)]
*  it could not fit the reconciliation process to eliminate outright taxes. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6133.0s)]
*  The reason that the deduction model was used was to appease the Senate rules process based upon the parliamentarian situation. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6138.0s)]
*  So if you're going to say what I said, at least say what I said. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6147.0s)]
*  But the $6,000, it would have to be $36,000 in my case. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6152.0s)]
*  And it's only $6,000. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6158.0s)]
*  It does not eliminate social security. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6160.0s)]
*  Taxes on social security. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6162.0s)]
*  So the first thing is, so the first thing is, and look, I'm not going to turn this into a conversation about tax law. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6164.0s)]
*  And I appreciate that you're probably coming from an honest place in this. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6170.0s)]
*  I will accept that premise. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6175.0s)]
*  This is an above the line deduction, meaning that on top of the standard deduction that you would take, or if you got into itemization, [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6177.0s)]
*  whichever it is that you choose, you get that plus you get the extra $6,000. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6186.0s)]
*  And what that means is that it effectively covers 100% of what the taxation is on social security for reported income up to $75,000 per tax filer. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6195.0s)]
*  That's the way it works. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6208.0s)]
*  If you simply took the standard deduction and then add the $6,000, you get to it. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6209.0s)]
*  It absolutely covers the tax, all of it on your social security. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6215.0s)]
*  That is just simply the way this thing goes. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6220.0s)]
*  If you take a look at the deduction on tips, it's a deduction of up to $25,000 on tipped income when filing taxes. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6223.0s)]
*  What that means is it effectively covers the first $150,000 in tipped income, which, by the way, accounts for over 99% of people who are in tips. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6234.0s)]
*  So over 99% of all tipped income is effectively tax free on this based upon the way that people earn money. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6245.0s)]
*  So again, based upon the way that people report their social security, it is effectively eliminating the tax on social security. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6253.0s)]
*  Based upon the way that almost everybody earns tips, the deduction effectively eliminates it on tips. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6261.0s)]
*  And then ditto on overtime as well. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6267.0s)]
*  And again, I understand that tax law is complicated. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6273.0s)]
*  I understand that understanding deductions on top of other deductions that you already get can make it even more complicated, [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6277.0s)]
*  which is why my recommendation is that if you are trying to figure this out yourself and you're not necessarily adept at understanding tax policy to begin with, [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6284.0s)]
*  good to talk to a person that you use to prepare taxes or maybe just seek out the advice of somebody so you could potentially even start saving money right away. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6293.0s)]
*  And I'll wait until tax day when you file to realize the benefit. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6301.0s)]
*  Let's go to John in Pennsylvania. John, welcome to the show. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6305.0s)]
*  Hey, glad to listen to you. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6311.0s)]
*  I wanted to comment about earlier in your monologue coming on tonight about Durham. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6316.0s)]
*  And is there a way you mentioned that Trump learns from his mistakes? [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6324.0s)]
*  Was it a mistake to try those people in a D.C. court? [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6330.0s)]
*  You're basically in amongst the vipers trying to convict a viper with vipers of his peers. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6336.0s)]
*  Why couldn't that venue be moved out of D.C.? [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6349.0s)]
*  Well, and herein lies the problem, right? [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6354.0s)]
*  And so where there is jurisdiction is where the crime is alleged to have been committed. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6356.0s)]
*  And when you're talking about these federal offenses with these D.C.-based agencies, that venue that has jurisdiction is D.C. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6361.0s)]
*  And so, you know, unless there is a granted request of a change of venue, [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6368.0s)]
*  and I can promise you that John Durham had no interest in bringing his cases in Washington, D.C. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6373.0s)]
*  If he had a choice, he would have loved to have had them somewhere else. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6377.0s)]
*  You know, then you're stuck. And this is the problem with D.C. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6381.0s)]
*  Is that you have not only, you know, so many corrupted government agencies, [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6385.0s)]
*  but you also have what essentially amounts to a corrupt city, [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6391.0s)]
*  because unfortunately, they're just are not based upon the politics of that place where, again, [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6396.0s)]
*  you're only at 6% of the population that voted for Trump. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6401.0s)]
*  The moment that you bring something that is, oh, well, this was somebody who, you know, was against Trump and conspired against Trump, great. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6404.0s)]
*  And it doesn't matter if they were guilty of sin. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6412.0s)]
*  You know, the ends justify the means. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6415.0s)]
*  I mean, it really is a sad state on, you know, the entire system of justice at a certain level. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6417.0s)]
*  But that is the problem in Washington, D.C. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6424.0s)]
*  And Janine Pirro is she is the attorney over D.C. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6427.0s)]
*  now. And so, you know, if they find stuff on Brennan, if they find stuff on Comey, Clapper, [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6432.0s)]
*  whomever else, as this FBI investigation has been referred and is underway now, [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6438.0s)]
*  I no doubt she'll bring charges. But, yeah, you do have to deal with the venue problems. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6445.0s)]
*  And that is that is a real issue. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6450.0s)]
*  And so unless there's a grant to change the venue, that's unlikely to occur. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6453.0s)]
*  The reality with which we live in, it is it is concerning. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6458.0s)]
*  You know, one of the smartest things that that Trump has been trying to work on is decentralizing D.C., [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6462.0s)]
*  getting some of these government agencies out of Washington, D.C., getting more federal employees to work elsewhere, [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6468.0s)]
*  closing a lot of these Washington, D.C. based offices. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6475.0s)]
*  That's important in all of this, because culturally, the place is just rotted. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6479.0s)]
*  Let's go to J.T. I was talking about this in the first hour as well. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6485.0s)]
*  J.T. in Panama City. Welcome to the show. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6492.0s)]
*  Hey, good morning. Thanks. Good evening. Thanks for taking the call. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6496.0s)]
*  You bet. My concern that I wanted to bring up, Mr. Mudd, is [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6500.0s)]
*  the veracity and the truthfulness that I think the White House physician owed to the American public [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6506.0s)]
*  by the questioning of the members of the U.S. Congress on the state of Mr. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6513.0s)]
*  Biden's health for the past four years that he treated him. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6518.0s)]
*  And the three issues that I'd briefly like to bring up is one, I believe the physician certainly was a government employee. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6521.0s)]
*  So all of his records and everything that he did should be a government record, [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6528.0s)]
*  not a personal record of treating a private physician like you or I might have our personal private physician. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6534.0s)]
*  And secondly, there must be records that the White House kept, [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6540.0s)]
*  not only there how many times this individual showed up at the White House, [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6545.0s)]
*  but also at the Delaware residence of Mr. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6549.0s)]
*  Biden. And that would lead evidence certainly that Mr. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6552.0s)]
*  Biden was receiving some type of medical treatments on the numerous occasions that he went to [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6557.0s)]
*  Delaware. And then when he came back to Washington, somehow his presence in his mental [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6562.0s)]
*  state seemed to be different than what it was before he departed to Delaware on many of these trips. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6568.0s)]
*  And then finally, there must be a drug and medical record, even even blood [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6574.0s)]
*  doping record records that could be found. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6580.0s)]
*  You know, did we have blood transfusions that were taking place as athletes have done in the past in an illegal manner that pumped up Mr. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6584.0s)]
*  Biden? [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6592.0s)]
*  Jacked up Joe. Yeah. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6594.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, we know that there came a point where he that didn't work anymore because I think all of us were [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6595.0s)]
*  expecting jacked up Joe for that debate. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6600.0s)]
*  And then we saw we saw a slow joke come out in dementia, Joe. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6602.0s)]
*  And as you know, that was that's when you knew the ship had sailed. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6607.0s)]
*  Yeah, look, I think you make good points on all those. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6610.0s)]
*  And I actually think that there is a reasonable chance that unlike a lot of things where we never seem to get real answers, [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6613.0s)]
*  I think there's a good chance that this a lot of the information you're talking about ends up coming to the surface. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6620.0s)]
*  You are seeing this one's peeling back like an onion. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6628.0s)]
*  And there aren't a lot of people there that are necessarily protecting him at this point. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6631.0s)]
*  And I don't think there are going to be a lot of people that want to go down with the ship for Biden this way. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6636.0s)]
*  So this might be one of the ones where we actually get to those answers that you're talking about. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6641.0s)]
*  Appreciate the call. Brian Mudd and for the great one. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6646.0s)]
*  Mudd, love in. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6649.0s)]
*  I think there's a good chance we'll have the ceasefire and that'll get us closer to the goal that I said from the beginning. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6651.0s)]
*  Let's get them all back without capitulation. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6669.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, of course, it's really Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu talking about the potential for a ceasefire with Hamas. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6673.0s)]
*  The first almost six months of Trump's administration has just been cleaning up the mess, right? [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6682.0s)]
*  He left. We had relative peace. Now a war all over the place, right? [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6688.0s)]
*  The Russian Ukraine dealing that whole situation. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6694.0s)]
*  October 7th never happens if Trump is president trying to, you know, re stabilize that situation. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6696.0s)]
*  There's so many things that we have to be grateful for is giving ideas. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6704.0s)]
*  Something that I thought was interesting coming out of Independence Day weekend last year, I was taking a look at how far we had come a year later. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6709.0s)]
*  And like my top stories coming out of the fourth of July last year, I was talking about there being one hundred and twenty three days before sanity would be restored and then one hundred ninety nine days. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6717.0s)]
*  You know, so I was talking about the election and then inauguration day. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6732.0s)]
*  And when you take a look at the top stories from about a year ago, you had dementia Joe saying that he was going to stay in the presidential race. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6735.0s)]
*  You had billions more for Ukraine handed out by Biden. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6745.0s)]
*  You had the New York judge in the stormy freaking Daniels hush money case announced that he was delaying Trump's sentencing following his conviction. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6750.0s)]
*  And we had an average of nearly 10,000 illegal immigrants per day coming into the country. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6759.0s)]
*  That's the place we were in a year ago. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6763.0s)]
*  You take a look at where we are now. The inflation rate at two point four percent, the lowest it's been since Trump was one month removed from the presidency. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKhspbhXHk&t=6766.0s)]
