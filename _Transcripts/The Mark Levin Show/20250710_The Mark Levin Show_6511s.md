Video Description: On Thursday’s Mark Levin Show, lower federal courts are ignoring Supreme Court rulings, with judges defying the Constitution and law on immigration. In LA, a judge rules that ICE roundups are racist, alleging indiscriminate arrests of brown-skinned people at Home Depots, car washes, farms, etc., due to ethnicity and a 3,000-daily quota. In addition, in New Hampshire, a judge upholds birthright citizenship via national injunction, citing long-standing practice over constitutional analysis. The media ignore this, while actions persist. The judges have changed, not the Constitution. Also, President Trump has made enormous progress domestically and internationally, but institutions are being turned against Americans. Democrats will inevitably win elections and use the permanent government, courts, and administrative state to try to permanently embed their ideology, making it irreversible. Zohran Mamdani’s Stalinist Islamist fusion of ideologies has overtaken parts of Europe and is now infiltrating the U.S., funded by entities like Qatar, Hamas, Iran, and Communist China. Later, socialism is an economic ideology from Marxism, which is a broader life ideology encompassing socialism but extending to cultural, social, and political transformation. The modern activists and professors are unoriginal Karl Marx wannabes who regurgitate ideas from Marx, Hegel, and Rousseau. Thery reject individual liberty and free will as divisive and weak, favoring instead class unity and collective power. There is a comprehensive war on civil society, culture, and America's foundations—targeting family, economy, and liberty—rooted in deadly, anti-human Marxist principles that promote genocide and centralized power.  Afterward, there is a vile and destructive element within the Republican Party. Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene is undermining Trump and introducing amendments removing $500 million in military aid to Israel from the National Defense Authorization Act.  Finally, Mahmoud Khalil filed a $20 million claim against the Trump administration. Only in America does a pro Hamas protestor like this turnaround and bring a lawsuit when he should never have been here in the first place. David Schoen calls in to explain that Khalil is 100% deportable under U.S. Code sections 1227 and 1182 for endorsing and supporting Hamas.

# Power and Ideology: The Radical Shift in American Courts
**The Mark Levin Show:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8)
*  The radical left's agendas are attacking your American values, but conservatives like you haven't forgotten what this country was built on. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=0.0s)]
*  My friends, the Heritage Foundation exists to make sure your voice is heard and to represent your values in the swamp and quagmire of D.C. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=7.0s)]
*  The Heritage Foundation stands for your values and will not give up the fight because they know you never will. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=15.0s)]
*  Paid for by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=22.0s)]
*  The Heritage Foundation is a non-command puzzle. Deep in the bowels of a hidden bunker, somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building, we once again make contact with our leader, Mark LeVein. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=30.0s)]

*  The Heritage Foundation is a non-command puzzle. Deep in the bowels of a hidden bunker, somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building, we once again make contact with our leader, Mark LeVein. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=110.0s)]
*  Hello America, Mark LeVein here, our number 877-381-3811, 877-381-3811. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=118.0s)]
*  While these lower federal courts act as if the Supreme Court never ruled, we have a judge in the LA area, appointed by Biden, whose name I can't even pronounce, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=128.0s)]
*  who's issuing an opinion tomorrow in full, today in part, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=137.0s)]
*  essentially claiming that the ICE roundup of various illegal aliens is racist, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=144.0s)]
*  among other things. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=156.0s)]
*  And so, we will wait to get more of that. We have a judge today who also ruled with a national injunction [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=159.0s)]
*  in support of birthright citizenship, so they're still on the move here. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=170.0s)]
*  They're still doing what they've been doing in many regards, is if the US Supreme Court hasn't ruled. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=174.0s)]
*  So now we have these Biden-Obama judges who are literally defying not just the Constitution and federal law, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=180.0s)]
*  not just separation of powers, the core of the Constitution, but are now defying a ruling by the United States Supreme Court. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=189.0s)]
*  And it's funny, you're not hearing in the press, are you, about the attack on the Constitution, about judicial tyranny or dictatorships? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=197.0s)]
*  You're not hearing about any of that. And yet that's exactly what's taking place in this country right now. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=208.0s)]
*  And if the judge in LA, should her ruling be upheld, which I doubt it would be, but again it takes time, but should it be upheld, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=214.0s)]
*  you will not be able to round up people and deport them because the ACLU's basic position, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=222.0s)]
*  and man, let me tell you something, they're throwing a 60-yard bass and they threw it to the right judge. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=228.0s)]
*  They threw it to the right judge. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=234.0s)]
*  They're basically saying you can't go into certain neighborhoods because of their ethnicity, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=239.0s)]
*  you can't go into certain places because of their ethnicity, and on and on, because it's just palpable racial discrimination. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=243.0s)]
*  You believe this, Mr. Reducer? So you can't go into the neighborhoods where these people are [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=250.0s)]
*  because you're going into the neighborhoods where these people are. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=255.0s)]
*  Now let me be very clear about something. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=263.0s)]
*  President Trump has made enormous progress all across the map, domestic and foreign. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=267.0s)]
*  But these institutions are now being turned against us. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=273.0s)]
*  And we're not going to have President Trump around forever, and we're not going to win elections forever. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=277.0s)]
*  They're going to win elections too. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=282.0s)]
*  And when they win elections, they use the permanent part of the government, the courts and the administrative state, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=284.0s)]
*  to enshrine their ideology, making it impossible to undo it, election or no election. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=289.0s)]
*  It's important to know what we're dealing with here. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=295.0s)]
*  This is the Democrat Party. The Democrat Party hates America. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=297.0s)]
*  I wrote a whole book and it explains it. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=300.0s)]
*  But this ideology, the Marxist, Islamist ideology, is at home in the Democrat Party. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=304.0s)]
*  That's where it is. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=310.0s)]
*  And its anti-Americanism is at the core of their belief system. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=315.0s)]
*  Its anti-Americanism is at the core of their belief system. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=320.0s)]
*  It's at the core of their belief system. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=325.0s)]
*  You have this guy running in New York, Zoran Mamdani, who's a complete fraud. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=329.0s)]
*  He filed on his college application, said he was both black and Asian American. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=339.0s)]
*  He's neither black nor Asian American. He's Indian. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=343.0s)]
*  He's a cheat. He's a liar. He's a fraud. But he's serious about his ideology. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=347.0s)]
*  And his ideology is Stalinist, Islamist. That's what it is. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=354.0s)]
*  It's not democratic, socialist. It is Stalinist, Islamic. That's what it is. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=360.0s)]
*  And it is this ideology, this fusion of ideologies that have taken over much of Europe. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=367.0s)]
*  And it is this ideology, this fusion of ideologies that have taken over much of Europe. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=372.0s)]
*  You'll see one town after another, one city after another, Britain and France. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=376.0s)]
*  Other parts of Europe. And now here in the United States. It's not an accident. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=380.0s)]
*  Qatar has funded this. Hamas has funded this. Iran has funded this. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=384.0s)]
*  Communist China has funded this. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=389.0s)]
*  You'd be shocked at some of the conservative platforms in our media [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=391.0s)]
*  that have money from Qatar or Saudi Arabia or individuals who are sympathetic to them. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=395.0s)]
*  If you hear people saying things that seem weird, as Russia would say, follow the money. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=402.0s)]
*  Now here we have the chairman of the Democrat National Committee, Ken Martin, on PBS Today. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=412.0s)]
*  He's asked about Zaran Mandami's refusal to condemn the globalization of the Intifada. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=419.0s)]
*  The globalization of the Intifada of America is worldwide terrorism targeting Jews and the West. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=425.0s)]
*  That is the killing of Jews and the West internationally. That's what it is. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=432.0s)]
*  And he won't condemn it. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=437.0s)]
*  Listen to this. Hat-tip free beacon, cut six, go. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=443.0s)]
*  What about concerns from some of your Jewish colleagues in particular about him not outright condemning the phrase [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=446.0s)]
*  globalize the Intifada in a recent interview? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=452.0s)]
*  Some of your Jewish colleagues have said that that could be very disturbing, potentially dangerous. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=454.0s)]
*  Do you agree with that? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=459.0s)]
*  You know, there's no candidate in this party that I agree 100% of the time with, to be honest with you. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=461.0s)]
*  There's things that I don't agree with, Mamdani, that he said. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=466.0s)]
*  But at the end of the day, I always believe as a Democratic Party chair in Minnesota for the last 14 years [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=470.0s)]
*  and now the chair of the DNC that you win through addition. You win by bringing people into your coalition. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=475.0s)]
*  Okay, now listen to this guy. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=480.0s)]
*  Just a political hack spewing stupidity. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=483.0s)]
*  He won't condemn it. He will not condemn it. Go ahead. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=487.0s)]
*  Conservative Democrats, we have centrist Democrats, we have... [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=492.0s)]
*  What does this have to do with the guy saying globalize the Intifada? Absolutely nothing. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=496.0s)]
*  We have conservative Democrats, very few. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=502.0s)]
*  We have progressives like me, he says. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=505.0s)]
*  And now you have jihadis and Islamists who believe in slaughtering people in the West, especially Jews. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=507.0s)]
*  That's your big umbrella. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=516.0s)]
*  Your big umbrella includes individuals who spew terrorist slogans. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=518.0s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=525.0s)]
*  ...like me, and we have this new brand of Democrat, which is the leftist. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=527.0s)]
*  And we win by bringing people into that coalition. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=532.0s)]
*  And at the end of the day, for me, that's the type of party we're going to lead. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=535.0s)]
*  We are a big tent party. Yes, it leads to dissent. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=539.0s)]
*  All right, it's a big tent party, ladies and gentlemen. You heard him. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=541.0s)]
*  So it's a big tent party that includes terrorists or individuals who spew terrorist lines. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=544.0s)]
*  That's the big tent. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=551.0s)]
*  Arzu Malik. Oh, yeah, the names are just great. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=554.0s)]
*  Arzu Malik is a former intern for Zoran Mamdani. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=557.0s)]
*  Arzu Malik, former intern for Zoran Mamdani. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=562.0s)]
*  Calls for a holy war through jihad. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=567.0s)]
*  That is, the slaughter of people who don't agree with him. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=570.0s)]
*  That's what a holy war is. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=573.0s)]
*  Hat-tip-tip-libs of TikTok. Cut seven, go. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=576.0s)]
*  And the true believer knows that none of this is in vain, that this is all jihad, that this is all ibadah, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=579.0s)]
*  and that this is all counted for by Allah, Subhanahu wa Ta'ala. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=585.0s)]
*  And so the conversation of doxing, the conversation of getting arrested and suspended, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=588.0s)]
*  I think it's time for Muslims to start to say, all right, all right, so what? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=594.0s)]
*  Do what you want. I'm going to do what I got to do, because it's about time to do that. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=598.0s)]
*  And I know everybody has their own families and has an education and everything. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=604.0s)]
*  Just a question. We don't want to get doxed and we don't want to get suspended and we don't want to get arrested. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=611.0s)]
*  How gangster are you? That's just my question. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=617.0s)]
*  How much are you willing to do it? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=620.0s)]
*  And I know everyone has their own risk level, but at the end of the day, that's a question to ask ourselves. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=622.0s)]
*  How committed am I to this? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=627.0s)]
*  How to what extent of my personal material gains am I willing to sacrifice for this bigger noble cause? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=630.0s)]
*  And the bigger noble cause, ladies and gentlemen, is the violent overthrow of the United States of America, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=639.0s)]
*  the violent overthrow of the West, the violent overthrow of the city of New York. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=646.0s)]
*  Listen to this woman. Listen to this punk. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=654.0s)]
*  People come into this country or they're born into this country. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=658.0s)]
*  Look how they talk about the country. They're at war with the country. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=663.0s)]
*  They think it's funny. They're aggressive about it. They're ideological about it. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=667.0s)]
*  They hate us. They hate the country. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=671.0s)]
*  This is what we're breeding in this country. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=676.0s)]
*  Lack of assimilation, a lack of patriotism. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=680.0s)]
*  Our schools have been taken over by these iron-fisted police state type teachers unions. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=683.0s)]
*  As I've said to you many times before, the Democrat Party is like the Communist Party in these communist regimes. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=694.0s)]
*  It's about the party. It's not about the country. Whatever it takes. A big tent. A big tent. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=698.0s)]
*  Yeah, we'll let in the Marxists, the Islamists, the Jew haters, the American haters, the flag burners. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=704.0s)]
*  Yeah, we'll let them in. Big tent. We're a big tent party. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=709.0s)]
*  And they're really not, are they? Not if you're pro-life. Not if you're moderate. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=713.0s)]
*  No, you're really not part of the big tent, are you? Go ahead. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=720.0s)]
*  When your heart is in the right place, if you get suspended, if you get doxxed because it's bound to happen when you're doing a righteous cause and when you're doing something for the sake of Allah here in the West. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=726.0s)]
*  You're doing something for the sake of Allah here in the West. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=736.0s)]
*  And from her perspective, what is the sake of Allah here in the West? It is the utter and complete evisceration of the West. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=738.0s)]
*  That's what it is. That's what it is. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=747.0s)]
*  This is a young person. This guy running from there is 33 years old. This is his mindset. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=754.0s)]
*  When you read my book on power, when you read my book American Marxism, the Democrat Party Hates America, these last three books lay it out. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=759.0s)]
*  This book on power is very, very important. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=768.0s)]
*  It's a book for our times. It really is for the times that we're describing right now that you're witnessing right now. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=772.0s)]
*  We've got a real, a real problem here. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=780.0s)]
*  A real spiderweb of problems here with the lower courts taken over by these leftists, American Marxists and Islamists. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=784.0s)]
*  We have people here who are first generation. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=790.0s)]
*  Biden picked these people not because they're first generation, but they're first generation radicals. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=793.0s)]
*  That's why he picked them. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=799.0s)]
*  And they're here and they put them on the bench. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=802.0s)]
*  They took them out of these radicals. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=806.0s)]
*  You know, non-governmental organizations, radical ethnic front groups out of the ACLU, out of our law schools and so forth. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=808.0s)]
*  They picked the most radical people they could and now they're judges. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=816.0s)]
*  So they're advocates as judges. They're activists as judges. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=819.0s)]
*  This is who they are. This is what they're doing. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=824.0s)]
*  And they're still doing what they're doing. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=828.0s)]
*  They're still doing what they're doing. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=831.0s)]
*  This is who they are. This is what they're doing. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=833.0s)]
*  And they're still issuing these nationwide injunctions or they're issuing injunctions in order to stop ICE from taking out illegal immigrants. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=837.0s)]
*  Let me ask you something. How come in the 1950s when Eisenhower did this over a six month period and deported over a million people, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=845.0s)]
*  how come he wasn't violating the Constitution left and right? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=853.0s)]
*  But today, if you try and do it, you're violating the Constitution left and right. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=857.0s)]
*  Did the Constitution change? No, the judges have changed. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=860.0s)]
*  The judges have changed. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=864.0s)]
*  So even now when the Supreme Court rules, these lower courts give it the finger. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=867.0s)]
*  And you have advocates, advocates for this destructive ideology, for the American Marxist Islamist ideology on the court. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=874.0s)]
*  It's typically Sotomayor, Kagan and Jackson. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=884.0s)]
*  But even Jackson, Jackson is one of a kind. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=887.0s)]
*  She's completely out of the closet. She is a judicial bomb thrower. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=892.0s)]
*  And her opinions aren't even rational. They're not even based on precedent or law or the Constitution. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=896.0s)]
*  They're like op-eds in the Washington Post or the New York Times. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=902.0s)]
*  I've got a lot more. We'll be right back. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=906.0s)]
*  What? Hello Ben. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=909.0s)]
*  American Flag [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=911.0s)]
*  Folks, the American flag is under attack. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=916.0s)]
*  We saw it mocked and burned in LA during protests. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=919.0s)]
*  And when people attack the American flag, aren't they attacking everything it stands for? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=922.0s)]
*  The sacrifice of our troops, the values of our founding, the promise of liberty and justice for all. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=926.0s)]
*  Thankfully, patriots like you haven't forgotten what the flag stands for. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=931.0s)]
*  You're the reason the Heritage Foundation created Flags of Our Fathers. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=935.0s)]
*  The meaning and history of the U.S. flag. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=938.0s)]
*  This is a resource for patriots like you to remind and refresh ourselves of the American flag's history and deep importance to our nation. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=941.0s)]
*  Claim your free copy today at heritage.org slash levin. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=949.0s)]
*  That's heritage.org slash L-E-V-I-N. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=953.0s)]
*  If we lose the meaning of our flag, we risk losing our nation. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=956.0s)]
*  That's why it's imperative that patriots just like you take advantage of the Heritage Foundation's new resource, Flags of Our Fathers. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=959.0s)]
*  Let's do our part in this fight by going to heritage.org slash levin right now. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=965.0s)]
*  Heritage.org slash L-E-V-I-N. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=970.0s)]
*  Paid for by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=973.0s)]
*  Music. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=976.0s)]
*  To be specific, so here we have a federal judge in New Hampshire appointed by George W. Bush. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=982.0s)]
*  Who basically certifies a class status, meaning a national injunction as Sam Alito warned. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=986.0s)]
*  On the birthright citizenship issue, class status meaning now he's going to rule for a whole class of people no matter where they live. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=992.0s)]
*  Illegal alien children. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=999.0s)]
*  And I read most of what he had to say and basically the judge has exactly what I told you they would say and what I fear the Supreme Court majority will say, which is the right thing to do. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1002.0s)]
*  This is a long-standing practice, birthright citizenship. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1013.0s)]
*  Who am I to undo this after all these years? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1017.0s)]
*  And he is self-righteous and is toned. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1020.0s)]
*  It's not even a close call. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1023.0s)]
*  So it's not really a constitutional analysis at all. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1025.0s)]
*  He'll get around to it. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1028.0s)]
*  They'll dress it up as a constitutional issue and a constitutional answer. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1030.0s)]
*  But that's the bottom line. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1034.0s)]
*  They're going to say, this has been going on a long time. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1036.0s)]
*  Who am I to upset the Constitutional issue? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1038.0s)]
*  And they'll say, this has been going on a long time. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1040.0s)]
*  Who am I to upset it? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1042.0s)]
*  So that's where that's going. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1044.0s)]
*  And that was my fear. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1046.0s)]
*  Now we have a judge in LA, Judge Mamie Uwusi Mensah Frimpong. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1048.0s)]
*  I kid you not. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1054.0s)]
*  A Biden appointee on granting emergency restraining orders against ICE over allegations the agency is violating the constitutional rights during its immigration arrests. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1056.0s)]
*  It was brought in June. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1066.0s)]
*  It was brought in June. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1067.0s)]
*  It was brought in a petition by three detainees. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1069.0s)]
*  It's ballooned into this big case. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1071.0s)]
*  And these so-called groups and local governments, including LA and West Hollywood and so on, they've all intervened in the case. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1073.0s)]
*  And the plaintiffs allege that ICE is indiscriminately arresting people with brown skin at home depots and car washes and farms and more. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1080.0s)]
*  And I've asked this question before. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1090.0s)]
*  Well, where do you find illegal aliens? [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1092.0s)]
*  Car washes, farms, restaurants, home depots. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1093.0s)]
*  Where the hell else are they going to be? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1098.0s)]
*  7-elevens. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1100.0s)]
*  But it was based on their skin color, you see. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1102.0s)]
*  That's why they were going into these locations. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1105.0s)]
*  The plaintiffs argue the Trump administration gave ICE an unrealistic quota of 3,000 arrests per day. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1107.0s)]
*  The plaintiffs also asked the judge to expand visitor access to short-term detention. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1114.0s)]
*  And so basically it's a race issue now, you see, because if you're collecting people who've come here from Haiti or Africa or central or South America or other places, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1122.0s)]
*  and you go where they live or where they're active, then that is per se proof, prima facie proof that you're a racist. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1137.0s)]
*  Crazy, nuts. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1147.0s)]
*  Folks, we've seen in our streets over the past several months the burning of the American flag. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1154.0s)]
*  Even worse, we saw the Mexican flag and the Palestinian flag wave defiantly during LA's violent riots. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1158.0s)]
*  There's something seriously wrong with that picture. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1164.0s)]
*  The American flag is under attack across the country, and with it the American promise of liberty. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1165.0s)]
*  But while the left attacks our flag and everything else we hold dear, bold conservatives like you across the country refuse to let the flag fall. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1171.0s)]
*  That's why the Heritage Foundation created Flags of Our Fathers, a critical resource for patriots who want to remind ourselves of the American flag's history. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1180.0s)]
*  Flags of Our Fathers contains the untold history of the flag's creation and the meaning of the stars and stripes. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1189.0s)]
*  Take a stand for the American flag today by going to heritage.org slash levin, heritage.org slash levin, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1195.0s)]
*  and claiming your free copy of Flags of Our Fathers. That's heritage.org slash levin, paid for by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1203.0s)]
*  Mark Levin, the research arm of conservative media. Call in now, 877-381-3811. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1212.0s)]
*  That's incredible, isn't it? There's other rulings today too, but it's incredible how these institutions have been completely corrupted. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1221.0s)]
*  Completely corrupted. And these judges are just shockingly appalling. They truly are. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1233.0s)]
*  By the way, we have two great shows on Life, Liberty and Levin this weekend. I hope you'll set your DVR. I hope you'll watch them live. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1242.0s)]
*  I hope you'll do both, just in case. Saturday we have a full one-hour interview with Benjamin Netanyahu. That's why I wasn't here on the radio. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1250.0s)]
*  I had to go to Washington, D.C. It's a fascinating interview. It's not the typical type of interview. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1260.0s)]
*  He was very relaxed. And you'll see a side of him you haven't seen. And he's smart as hell. And there are different things he was talking about. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1267.0s)]
*  In any event, I think you're going to find it very intriguing. And that's an exclusive interview with the Prime Minister for the full hour. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1275.0s)]
*  And then on Sunday we have our friend Stephen Miller. And he's going to be talking about the [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1285.0s)]
*  two really fantastic minds there. And that's Sunday. So Saturday, 8 p.m. Eastern on Life, Liberty and Levin on Fox. Sunday, 8 p.m. Eastern on Life, Liberty and Levin on Fox. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1295.0s)]
*  If you're not sure you're going to be around, that's why you should always set your DVR. We actually do that in our own house for shows that we want to watch, too. You should check that out. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1303.0s)]

*  liberty, and then the epilogue. And it's all extremely relevant to what's taking [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1386.72s)]
*  place today. Funny thing is I have a section on the courts, I have a section on [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1392.54s)]
*  Marxism, Islamism, I have a section on you name it, and yet it's the most concise [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1395.8s)]
*  book I've ever written. It's also the best-priced book I've ever written, and I [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1401.2s)]
*  think the timing is very, very important. It's also the timing is propitious, that [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1407.8s)]
*  is there's a level of luck when you release a book, you write a book, if the [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1412.32s)]
*  timing is right or if the timing is not right, it just happens to be that the timing [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1421.04s)]
*  on this book is right. And on the back cover there's an excerpt from On [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1424.68s)]
*  Power. Many have written about and debated the issue of power, including the [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1431.18s)]
*  ancients and modern philosophers, scholars, and statesmen alike. Why? Because [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1436.92s)]
*  power determines your social arrangements, quality of life, and more to [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1441.64s)]
*  the point of this book, whether you are free or enslaved or some degree of [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1444.88s)]
*  either. In short, it determines your personal fate, the fate of your community, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1448.96s)]
*  and the fate of a nation. So much in life orbits around this word, this idea, belief, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1453.0s)]
*  power. This book is intended to provoke a better comprehension of what is meant by [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1459.0s)]
*  power, the impact on the individual and mankind generally, and stimulate a [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1463.84s)]
*  broader examination and dialogue about its applications. In doing so, if it [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1467.88s)]
*  succeeds even modestly, perhaps it will prove an additional source for liberty [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1472.48s)]
*  and against tyranny. And that's why I wrote it the way I did, that's why it's [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1477.2s)]
*  concise, but I don't pull any punches in this book. I don't pull any punches and [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1481.0s)]
*  we move smoothly through history and philosophy, ancient philosophy, modern [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1490.08s)]
*  philosophy, we move smoothly through our own history, worldwide history, faith and [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1495.52s)]
*  religion, and all these different things. Because this is your life, this your life [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1502.28s)]
*  is much more complicated than you might even think. You might say, I go to work, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1507.1999999999998s)]
*  but your life as a human being, the things that influence you and the things [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1512.4399999999998s)]
*  that you influence, many of which you may not realize. You're a universe unto [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1517.44s)]
*  yourself and you're a universe that projects onto others. And in effect, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1524.0s)]
*  that's what I'm trying to describe in the book. We talk about liberty here and I [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1530.0s)]
*  have, you know, we changed to talk radio on this show, we changed it forever. When we [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1535.24s)]
*  get into philosophy and we get into history, we get in all these things. I [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1543.52s)]
*  could sit here and talk about Epstein till I'm blue in the face, I could sit [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1548.6399999999999s)]
*  here and talk about whatever it is, these things will come and go, they'll be [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1553.8799999999999s)]
*  resolved one way or another. But your liberty and your rights are up for grabs, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1559.24s)]
*  America. There's a lot of shiny objects out there and the goal is to ignore them. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1563.92s)]
*  There are a lot of pseudo events, there's a lot of propagandists and demagogues, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1569.8000000000002s)]
*  there's a lot of stuff going on out there that will not affect your lives one iota. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1573.8400000000001s)]
*  Contrarily, there's a lot of things going on each and every day that will affect [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1579.6000000000001s)]
*  your lives and don't get the focus that they need, either because we're busy or [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1583.5600000000002s)]
*  we're distracted. And it's my role, my job, in my view, is to keep us focused. I [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1587.5600000000002s)]
*  don't always succeed, I don't always succeed myself, that's the nature of [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1596.8s)]
*  imperfection, but that's okay. And one of the things I decided when I sat down to [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1599.8s)]
*  write this book, when I write a book, I've been thinking about something a [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1606.28s)]
*  long time, I don't just say, okay, now it's time to write a book, let me talk about [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1610.96s)]
*  how-do, let me talk about myself and my third volume of my memoir, no, no, no. I [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1614.68s)]
*  just came to realize that we talk about liberty and we talk about rights and we [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1621.88s)]
*  must talk about liberty, we must talk about rights, but they don't matter if [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1626.44s)]
*  the earthly manifestation of liberty and rights don't exist, or they're not in the [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1632.88s)]
*  proper place, or they're not set up the way they need to be set up. In other [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1639.04s)]
*  words, we get these liberties and these rights from God, from a more powerful [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1644.6399999999999s)]
*  force than human beings. So we talk about unalienable rights or free will, but they [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1653.28s)]
*  don't mean anything if here on earth, here on earth, they're not [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1660.36s)]
*  practiced or put in practice a certain way. And so I got to thinking. When we [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1666.1999999999998s)]
*  talk about the Constitution, when we talk about liberty, when we talk about [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1672.8s)]
*  rights and so forth, we do not spend enough time on power, because power [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1676.12s)]
*  determines if you actually can exercise these God-given rights. Now people [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1682.84s)]
*  talk about in passing the type of governments that are set up, that's what [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1690.6399999999999s)]
*  I'm talking about, that but much more, which is why I get into things like [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1693.76s)]
*  negative power, positive power, soft negative power, soft positive power, and so [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1701.0800000000002s)]
*  forth and so on. One day, probably when I'm long dead and gone, the book will be [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1705.76s)]
*  used in ways to describe what should have been or what could have been or what [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1710.5600000000002s)]
*  needs to be. Now you know here I'm behind this microphone or in front of a TV [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1715.76s)]
*  camera or wherever I am, and so there's Marc Levin. People either love me or they [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1721.54s)]
*  don't. Many of you do and I much appreciate that. But when the words are [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1728.12s)]
*  read and the concepts are made, the terms are expressed without really a [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1734.3999999999999s)]
*  reflection on me, that is the messenger, I actually think they'll have more [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1741.4799999999998s)]
*  meaning. Look to me that's kind of sad, but that's the nature of the beast. I'm [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1748.4599999999998s)]
*  not Alexis de Tocqueville, but for 50 years Alexis de Tocqueville was ignored [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1753.96s)]
*  until after he died. He died, he was about 50, and 40 or 50 years later people began [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1757.92s)]
*  to pick up his two volumes, The Democracy in America, which were largely ignored, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1762.64s)]
*  and they said, wait a minute, this is real stuff, this is important, this is [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1766.56s)]
*  important stuff. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1771.1200000000001s)]
*  Frédéric Bastiat, the same thing. He wrote the book The Law. Short book, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1774.84s)]
*  basically thoughts, little essays and so forth and so on, but he was long gone [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1784.3999999999999s)]
*  until somebody said, whoa, this is important stuff. I suspect from, could be [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1790.0s)]
*  way off, that that's the sort of thing that'll happen with these books, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1797.24s)]
*  particularly this one, but On Power is written really for now and in the future, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1800.36s)]
*  it's written to have a lasting impact. If not today, tomorrow and [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1806.4799999999998s)]
*  the next day, if you get my point Mr. Benusser. And when I watch this guy in [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1813.8s)]
*  New York, when I watch what's going on on our streets, I'll tell you what, after I [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1822.3999999999999s)]
*  interviewed Benjamin Netanyahu at the Blair House, there were a lot of people [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1825.6399999999999s)]
*  there that came to see him from Capitol Hill, from all over the government, from [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1830.16s)]
*  the private sector, they had an event, but I had to leave because I had to get [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1834.8s)]
*  my car out of the garage. The garage locked up at 9 p.m. so I left around 8 [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1840.32s)]
*  30 Eastern and the Blair House is, it's protected like it's a military compound, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1846.0s)]
*  it's so sad. When I worked in the Reagan administration, Lafayette Park and the [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1852.56s)]
*  Blair House, they were all accessible to the public, it's not the case anymore, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1857.64s)]
*  it's like a fort. The world has changed since 9 11 in a big way. So you kind of [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1860.76s)]
*  have to walk around the block and then walk back to Pennsylvania Avenue, and I [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1870.2800000000002s)]
*  did. There are a lot of very loud individuals yelling some very horrendous [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1874.6000000000001s)]
*  things about Jews and Israel and so forth. And so I walked and as I turned [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1881.4s)]
*  the street, I was noticed. And a guy in a bullhorn is yelling, there's Mark Levin [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1891.4s)]
*  from Fox, he's a Mossad Jew who needs to go back to Israel. Now that's the least [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1902.5600000000002s)]
*  of it, but they were yelling. So when people keep saying I'm Mossad, I'm [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1911.28s)]
*  Israel and things like that, when you know damn well I'm an American citizen, [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1916.84s)]
*  this has an effect on other people out in the streets, and it's very dangerous [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1923.2s)]
*  out there. It is very dangerous and they were following me with their bullhorns [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1931.2s)]
*  and it was loud and I didn't know what the hell they were gonna do. I wasn't [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1938.32s)]
*  gonna back down, but I didn't turn around to meet the mob, I just walked. And then [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1942.56s)]
*  there were some Secret Service and police as I made a left towards the [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1948.12s)]
*  parking lot where my car is and I said to a couple of the police officers, hey do [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1951.16s)]
*  you mind walking me to my car? They saw what was going on and they knew who I was [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1956.68s)]
*  and they were more than happy to do it. It's very dangerous out there, very. I am [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1960.08s)]
*  not kidding. Because you dare to express an opinion that is contrary to theirs. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1969.12s)]
*  There are people in this country now who come into the country, who come from a [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1977.1999999999998s)]
*  background and a culture that is extremely violent. There are also people [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1982.1599999999999s)]
*  in this country who are being raised, born in our country, to be extremely [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1987.88s)]
*  violent. And yet it is they we're told who have a right to free speech and due [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=1992.3600000000001s)]
*  process. As they chase people in the streets, as they chase people at [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2000.2s)]
*  colleges and universities, as they shut down free speech and academic freedom, as [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2006.04s)]
*  they try to shut down somebody like me. And I don't just get this from the hard [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2011.0s)]
*  left. I get this from the kooks on the other side too. But I'm not going to [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2015.96s)]
*  stop. Either the good Lord takes me or one of them take me. But I'm not going to [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2023.24s)]
*  stop. I think this book on power is a very powerful book. I've written it for [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2031.04s)]

*  Foundation. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2195.98s)]
*  Everything, everything about Marxism is wrong, everything. As I explained in [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2199.7s)]
*  Own Power, there's an ideology that was developed before the second Industrial Revolution, [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2209.22s)]
*  so there wasn't even a full-scale capitalist system functioning. It was written [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2215.38s)]
*  mostly during sort of a tepid growth of industrialization and mostly agrarianism. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2221.62s)]
*  And everything he wrote was wrong. The proletariat, the people would rise up and [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2228.54s)]
*  overthrow their government. In our country, the people rise up to defend our country [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2234.5s)]
*  and they go to war, put their lives on the line. In our country, a vast class of [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2238.98s)]
*  people, because of capitalism, we call them middle class, I don't like this class [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2243.7799999999997s)]
*  stuff, but a vast class of people were created who lived very comfortable lives, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2250.38s)]
*  unlike under most other countries and systems. Everything he wrote was wrong. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2255.3399999999997s)]
*  And then of course it's the endgame. These people write, whether Tagel or Rousseau, [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2260.58s)]
*  Marx and Engels and the others, they write like there is some permanent endgame [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2266.58s)]
*  that occurs when you're talking about a human society, a worker's paradise, if you [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2273.46s)]
*  will, or there's absolute equality, if you will. That is insane. That's not how [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2279.14s)]
*  humanity functions, that's not how societies function. There is no permanent [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2287.22s)]
*  endgame where everybody's equal or it's a worker's paradise or anything else. That [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2291.02s)]
*  comes out of the wild imagination of these would-be autocrats and [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2295.42s)]
*  dictators. So there's much, much wrong with Marxism, as I explained in the book. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2300.74s)]
*  That's just the tip of the iceberg. Islamism, same thing. Islamism is a [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2305.3s)]
*  bloody death cult as Marxism is. I'll be right back. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2310.26s)]

*  What I've been trying to do here, certainly in the last seven or eight [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2367.3s)]
*  years, is try and persuade people who come to you on radio and cable and other [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2372.54s)]
*  TV platforms to use the proper language. I don't mean English, proper English. I [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2380.46s)]
*  mean the proper language and identifying what we're up against. Just a few years [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2387.7400000000002s)]
*  ago when I wrote American Marxism, which sold 1.4 million copies, which is unheard [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2395.06s)]
*  of, Liberty and Tyranny sold 1.5. That's because you are interested in these [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2399.82s)]
*  subjects and on power, I hope, has a significant impact. They kept calling [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2404.94s)]
*  people progressives and then they kept calling people socialists. Now we need to [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2410.38s)]
*  understand. Marx himself said socialism is the last stage before communism. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2423.42s)]
*  Socialism is the last stage before communism and he hated the socialists [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2433.62s)]
*  because he believed that they watered down communism. Socialism is an economic [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2438.22s)]
*  ideology. Marxism is a life ideology. Marxism is an umbrella ideology that [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2448.58s)]
*  includes economic socialism, but it's beyond that. It's bigger than that. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2464.58s)]
*  President Trump has been calling these people Marxists and communists since I [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2472.98s)]
*  wrote this book, American Marxism. More and more people on Fox are using the [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2477.54s)]
*  proper terminology. More and more people on radio are using the proper [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2482.46s)]
*  terminology, but most of them weren't. When I watch these seminars and sessions [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2485.62s)]
*  online, clips of them, of these professors and these activists, they are Karl Marx [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2496.62s)]
*  wannabes. They're also Hegelian and Rousseauian, but I don't need to get into [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2504.78s)]
*  that. So they are Karl Marx wannabes. So they take little pieces of what [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2508.6600000000003s)]
*  Marx wrote and they regurgitate them and they want you to think they're smart. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2514.5s)]
*  There's nothing smart about it. Now let's go through a few of these things. Again, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2522.78s)]
*  it's in the book on power. It's in American Marxism. It's in what I write, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2531.74s)]
*  but let's go through a few of these. Individual liberty. You never [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2534.8999999999996s)]
*  hear these Marxists talk about individual liberty. You never hear Zoran [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2543.2999999999997s)]
*  Mamdani talk about individual liberty. Why? Because Marx denounced it, as did [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2549.4599999999996s)]
*  Hegel and Rousseau, but Marx denounced it. Individual liberty and free will, he [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2558.42s)]
*  said. I paraphrased for you. That means everybody lives on their own. They work [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2565.54s)]
*  on their own and they are weak. They're weak because they're on their own. The [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2574.02s)]
*  class of individuals need to unite. They need to aggregate into a movement to [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2583.9s)]
*  become a powerful part of the body politic. If you're exercising your own [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2591.94s)]
*  free will, you're going your own way, you're motivated by your own desires and [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2598.58s)]
*  so forth, you're the enemy of the communal. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2602.2200000000003s)]
*  You're the enemy because we cannot overcome what exists and change the [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2608.8599999999997s)]
*  status quo. Create this workers paradise of equality. Eliminate the wealthy, [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2615.3399999999997s)]
*  eliminate the elites, eliminate the this and the that. And of course they would [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2625.7799999999997s)]
*  take control, but we can't do these things when people are off on their own [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2631.3799999999997s)]
*  making money, pursuing what they're interested in. If you're a bricklayer, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2636.2999999999997s)]
*  maybe we don't need a bricklayer in your community. Maybe we need a plumber, so [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2640.98s)]
*  you need to be a plumber, not a bricklayer. Let's say you're a plumber. We [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2644.74s)]
*  don't need a plumber, according to the powers that be. We need a truck driver, so [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2648.0s)]
*  you're gonna be a truck driver. You're gonna do what's best for the communal, [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2656.22s)]
*  not what you think is best for you. That's immoral. It's immoral for you to be [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2661.3s)]
*  so selfish that you care about only yourself and your family. Now you will [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2670.62s)]
*  never hear this discussed on any news program that's discussing what's going [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2678.58s)]
*  on in New York with this clown the train from never. So he rejects the whole idea [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2682.14s)]
*  of individuality. When they talk about equality, human beings have different [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2686.82s)]
*  interests, they have different physical powers, they have different mental [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2693.1800000000003s)]
*  powers, they have different backgrounds and experiences and different tastes [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2696.78s)]
*  and desires. That's not permitted. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2700.1800000000003s)]
*  You've got to work in the quote-unquote best interests of the commune, of the [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2707.02s)]
*  communal. It's called communism for a reason. So your individual interests, [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2713.06s)]
*  the hell with them. They don't matter and you're gonna conform. You're gonna [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2720.62s)]
*  conform to what's... This is why communism, aka Marxism, is so bloody. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2725.02s)]
*  This is why they have death camps. This is why they round people up. This is why [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2734.1s)]
*  they try and destroy various ethnicities and minorities and so forth [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2740.98s)]
*  because in order to rejigger society, what do you have to rejigger? What is [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2745.38s)]
*  society? You have to rejigger human beings. You have to remake them. You have to [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2749.7000000000003s)]

*  And so it's ideology. A damnable, death cult ideology. A destructive ideology. An [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2800.78s)]
*  ideology that destroys economies, self-worth, neighborhoods. That drives [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2809.86s)]
*  them to the exclusion of real knowledge and experience. Because those who have a [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2817.46s)]
*  differing viewpoint, those who have real knowledge and experience, must be [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2827.1800000000003s)]
*  destroyed. Must be eliminated, or at least pushed to the side. Because that's [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2830.58s)]
*  dangerous. Dangerous. So individual liberty is viewed as a destructive belief [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2836.1s)]
*  and force. You're selfish. You're just one person. You're dispensable. And you see [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2849.9s)]
*  that, right? Family. Why do you think there's this effort to destroy the [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2860.3s)]
*  nuclear family? Why do you think there's an effort to destroy the meaning of [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2867.78s)]
*  women, the meaning of men, in all aspects of our culture? And not just sports. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2871.1400000000003s)]
*  That's the latest rendition of this stuff. Because the family is a social force [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2878.1800000000003s)]
*  within itself. There are bonds in a family that don't exist anywhere else. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2885.42s)]
*  Well for Marxists, the only social force that matters is this re-engineering of [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2892.34s)]
*  society. And if individuals acting on their own are the enemy of communism, [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2901.26s)]
*  families are the enemy of communism. Because families reinforce belief systems [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2910.26s)]
*  and attitudes that are contrary to the commune. And so yes, there should be no [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2918.0600000000004s)]
*  parental rights when it comes to schools. Yes, the children are the playthings [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2925.6200000000003s)]
*  of schools, government-run schools. And the unions, government-run unions. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2930.98s)]
*  And we're not going to define women as women, as men as men, and so forth and so [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2938.22s)]
*  on. We have got to destroy the entire construct of the family. Whether it means [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2943.22s)]
*  ignoring biology or whatever it is. This is why under Mao as an example, and all [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2948.74s)]
*  of them really, but under Mao you had the children ratting out the parents who [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2957.3799999999997s)]
*  weren't sufficiently revolutionary, and their parents would be taken off to [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2966.74s)]
*  death camps. Mao talks about this in the Communist Manifesto. You dare to [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2971.54s)]
*  criticize me over my view of family? And by the way, just to show you, Mao loved [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2980.9799999999996s)]
*  his children. Mao would never have surrendered his children to a government. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2989.74s)]
*  So when it comes to their own free will and their own families, they will fight [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=2995.3799999999997s)]
*  to the death. But when it comes to yours, they will destroy it. This is a very evil [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3001.7s)]
*  ideology. Extraordinarily evil. This is what Bernie Sanders stands for. This is [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3006.7s)]
*  what this moron and this Zoran Mamdani stands for. This is what Tlaib stands [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3012.9s)]

*  nobody around to confront these faculty members. There's nobody around to [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3027.5s)]
*  confront these politicians. I'm one guy. I don't know who they are and where they [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3031.14s)]
*  all are, but I use my microphone. I want to confront them. Because nobody knows [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3035.94s)]
*  how to debate them. Nobody. A handful of us. A handful of us. Why do you think Bernie [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3043.66s)]
*  Sanders won't come on this program? How many times have we asked this old man? [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3052.9s)]
*  Over and over, right, Rich? Why do you think Jamie Raskin won't come on this [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3055.98s)]

*  my ass in a debate, they'd come on the program. They can't because I will expose [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3068.38s)]

*  They're not going to get it [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3094.42s)]
*  because they don't want to be confronted. They don't want to be confronted. The war [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3097.9s)]
*  is more than a political war. It's more than an economic war. I told you it's [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3108.46s)]
*  Marxism. It's not socialism per se. It's a war on the civil society, the entire [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3112.1s)]
*  society, the culture, the entire makeup of this country. That's what the war is. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3119.34s)]
*  Before we had a declaration, before we had a constitution, we had a civil [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3125.26s)]
*  society. This is the core of everything. That's what they're focused on, [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3128.98s)]
*  destroying the family, destroying the economic system, destroying individual [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3135.3s)]

*  Genocide, the centralization of all power in the relative handful of a few, whether [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3150.02s)]

*  especially America, we have to militarize our ideology. When they're marching in [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3169.3s)]

*  States. They see that the Democrat Party is there for the taking. They see the [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3202.78s)]
*  Schumers and the Hakeem Jeffries and their ilk. Weak, pathetic. They see Obama [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3208.46s)]

*  They're devoured by it. Willingly so. The best they can do is say, I need to meet [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3220.02s)]
*  with the guy and have a conversation with the guy. Why? Because Schumer and [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3227.98s)]

*  Let's look at this issue of immigration. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3371.78s)]
*  For four years the Democrats lied about the border but we knew what they were doing. We [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3376.42s)]
*  talked about open borders. You look throughout human history, open borders were people from other [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3381.1400000000003s)]
*  countries who could just pour into another country. They destroy that country because [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3389.7s)]
*  there's no assimilation. There's no sovereignty. There's no allegiance to the existing country. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3397.3799999999997s)]
*  And there's no requirement that there be any. And so I just gave you the definition of a country. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3405.54s)]
*  So the country is destroyed. The Democrat party is destroying the country. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3411.06s)]
*  And it's time we stop candy-coating this stuff. If you're going to destroy the country, obviously [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3417.1400000000003s)]

*  fundamental transformation and they want both. But why they hate it is their problem, not our [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3425.3s)]
*  problem. The fact that they hate it and they do these things as a matter of national public policy, [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3430.1800000000003s)]

*  the country as it exists. Period. There's no other explanation. And they want power. And so they [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3442.26s)]
*  assume the people who come in, one day they'll get amnesty or not. One day they will birth millions [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3448.5800000000004s)]
*  of citizens and one day they will register for that party. And so you've changed the body politic. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3455.38s)]
*  You've changed the citizenry and you've changed the entire nature of the country. It's not [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3460.1800000000003s)]

*  And now you see when it comes to the deportation effort, the Democrat party is violently opposing ICE, [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3477.62s)]

*  Now, there's all kinds of technologies that our countries share with each other. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3762.1s)]
*  The Iron Dome technology and other technologies of that sort that are even more advanced, [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3770.5s)]

*  for free, as they should be. The intelligence information is shared among the two countries. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3789.46s)]
*  But more than anything else, we have shared values. The Holy Land is in Jerusalem, [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3799.94s)]
*  it's in Bethlehem, it's in all parts of the state of Israel, which Israel defends for all of us. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3805.54s)]
*  The birthplace of Judaism, the birthplace of Christianity. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3813.94s)]
*  Now, if we're not prepared to defend the birthplace of our faiths, and I'm being perfectly [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3822.34s)]
*  honest, let's forget about nation-states altogether. It's the United States or Israel or whatever. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3827.1400000000003s)]
*  If we're not prepared to defend the birthplace of our faiths, then we're not prepared to defend [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3833.46s)]
*  God's creation of Judaism and Christianity, then what the hell are we prepared to defend, Mr. Producer? [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3844.7400000000002s)]
*  We've never had a single American soldier fight a war for the state of Israel, never. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3857.1400000000003s)]
*  No infantry, nothing. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3867.2200000000003s)]
*  Nothing. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3869.46s)]
*  But my problem with this woman is her myopic focus on Israel, her comments about Jews and Judaism. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3873.22s)]
*  Same with her friend Bannon. There's something truly sick about these people. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3881.22s)]
*  Truly sick. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3888.34s)]
*  This is their focus. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3892.34s)]
*  We have an internal threat right now from this Marxist-Islamist fusion. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3894.18s)]
*  And they are hyper-focused on Jews in Israel. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3902.34s)]
*  Are Jews in Israel taking over our universities and destroying our universities and spending [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3908.98s)]
*  billions of dollars in order to undermine our country? Are they burning the American flag? [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3913.7799999999997s)]
*  Do they burn the American flag? Do they burn the American flag? Do they burn the American flag? [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3917.7s)]
*  Do they burn the American flag? Do they burn the Israeli flag? [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3922.26s)]
*  These are countries, these two countries that share exactly the same faiths and values. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3928.42s)]
*  And if you are a person of the Bible, God talks about the Holy Land and what needs to happen [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3942.02s)]
*  in the Holy Land. If you're not a person of the Bible, still it's practical to understand [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3949.3s)]
*  why this is important. We're tied at the hip, whether the anti-Semites like it or not, [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3956.34s)]
*  whether the isolationists like it or not. But their obsession [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3963.38s)]
*  and their hate for Netanyahu, it's the same that you get from the Marxists and the Islamists. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3970.42s)]
*  You literally have the neo-Nazis and the Klansmen and the Islamists and the Marxists [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3975.38s)]
*  on the same side of this. They want to overthrow the United States. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3979.7s)]
*  They support the destruction of Israel. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3987.7s)]
*  They're Jew haters. I mean, what else do you call it? [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3992.8199999999997s)]
*  What else do you call it? If there were another minority anywhere in this country, [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=3999.86s)]
*  blacks, Hispanics, Asians, whatever, they're not treated this way [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4003.54s)]
*  without pushback. This is why Donald Trump is so unique and so remarkable and so principled [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4013.7s)]
*  and so righteous. He sees it [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4021.86s)]
*  and he fights it. This is why his government's so remarkable, his administration. They fight it [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4026.18s)]
*  at the Department of Justice, at the FBI, at the Department of Homeland Security, at the State [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4031.78s)]
*  Department, at the Department of Education. They fight it. They take it on. Not Biden, [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4036.82s)]
*  not Harris, not the president, not the president of the United States, not the president of the [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4045.86s)]
*  United States, not Harris, not Hakeem Jeffries, not Schumer. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4053.1400000000003s)]
*  It's just an incredible thing to watch what's happening, to watch what's happening. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4065.94s)]
*  Troubling thing. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4077.3s)]
*  Donald Trump is not a big believer in foreign aid, but he believes in it when he believes it's [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4078.02s)]
*  helpful to the United States, when he believes it's helpful to the United States. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4082.9s)]
*  So obviously he believes this is helpful to the United States. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4091.94s)]
*  These people are not MAGA, they're not conservatives, they're not conservatives, [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4098.5s)]
*  these people are not MAGA, they're not conservatives, they're not populists, [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4104.82s)]

*  That's what they are. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4115.94s)]
*  I told you before, you got to call things what they are. The only way we're going to resolve [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4119.3s)]
*  these things is if we call them for what they are and call these people for what they are. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4123.94s)]
*  You know, they're on the fringes, they dress up in Halloween gear, and they dodge and they weave, [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4129.22s)]

*  You find them stabbing Trump in the back more on a more regular basis. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4150.34s)]
*  Well, so who is it that's their great leader? It's not Trump, it wasn't Reagan, who is it? [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4156.1s)]
*  You see, I'm anti-Republican establishment, I have been most of my career because I'm a [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4162.58s)]

*  of Israel, this fixation on what is it, AIPAC or this group, that is crazy. But it is, it's driven [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4194.9s)]
*  by something more than policy. It's driven by something more than principle. It's driven by [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4202.98s)]

*  for Americans. I don't think there's another show like this. Is there really, Mr. Producer? [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4362.98s)]
*  We move in and out, don't we? Heavy duty topics, important topics. You have to deal with the [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4371.54s)]
*  riffraff from now and then and clean off the bottom of our shoes. But we do what we do. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4380.26s)]
*  Doing it a long time. When you think about what took place under Biden, you have this doctor, [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4385.14s)]
*  Dr. Kevin O'Connor, who asserted the Fifth Amendment over and over again. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4391.14s)]
*  What took place those four years is an abomination in every respect. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4398.02s)]
*  But it was also a failing to uphold the Constitution. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4402.74s)]
*  The 25th Amendment in particular. That 25th Amendment was put there for circumstances [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4408.5s)]
*  like the Biden situation. It was bad enough when the man got elected and he wasn't all there. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4413.38s)]
*  And I don't say this to mock him, I'm just being honest. But it got very, very much worse [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4420.259999999999s)]
*  as time went on, and that's typical of dementia or Alzheimer's. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4427.62s)]
*  And not a single cabinet member and certainly not the vice president triggered the 25th Amendment. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4433.94s)]
*  And rather than every one of these people going down in history as a disgrace, [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4439.7s)]
*  some of them are positioning to run for governor or for president. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4446.26s)]
*  They had an obligation. They took an oath to the Constitution. That 25th Amendment's not there [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4450.74s)]
*  just for looks. And that should have been triggered. And Joe Biden should have been [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4454.9s)]
*  replaced. Look, I understand Kamala Harris would have been the next in line. I don't think she [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4461.46s)]
*  would have won an election anyway. But that's not the point. The Constitution is the Constitution. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4464.98s)]
*  It's not about playing politics. And so the Democrat Party allowed Joe Biden to sit in [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4469.46s)]
*  that spot until it became obvious to all the rest of the country, I had noticed, which is a joke, [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4475.54s)]
*  during the debate. And of course, they desperately sought to win elections, [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4481.14s)]
*  so they needed to move them out. But you know the history. But the point is the real issue there, [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4485.54s)]
*  it isn't even the signature machine. It's the 25th Amendment and how it was violated [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4491.22s)]
*  by these people. I'll be right back. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4496.02s)]
*  The bowels of a hidden bunker somewhere under the brick and steel of a non-district building. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4510.5s)]
*  We've once again made contact with our leader, Mark Levin. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4516.26s)]
*  Hello America. Mark Levin here. Our number 877-381-3811. 877-381-3811. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4524.9s)]
*  Mahmoud Khalil, this lowlife, [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4536.5s)]
*  who was helping to lead some of the activity there at Columbia University, is now seeking [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4542.0199999999995s)]
*  $20 million from the Trump administration over immigration arrest. So the guy should never [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4547.299999999999s)]
*  have been here. He was let in. And his conduct is really quite appalling. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4554.0199999999995s)]
*  And so now, this is how it works. This is the ACLU lawyers, the Islamicists lawyers, [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4562.18s)]
*  Reuters, Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University student and pro-Palestinian activist, [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4569.22s)]
*  pro-Palestinian activist. He's a pro-Hamas activist. Okay, I'm sick and tired of the media, [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4573.38s)]
*  particularly these British-based media outlets and foreign outlets like Reuters, [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4578.900000000001s)]
*  just lying to the American people. What do you mean pro-Palestinian? What does that mean? [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4582.820000000001s)]
*  Pro-Palestinian. You're for Hamas? You're for the Palestinian Authority, two terrorist organizations? [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4587.780000000001s)]
*  What does that mean? Even Hamas and the Palestinian Authority is not pro-Palestinian. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4593.3s)]
*  Seriously, America? Qatar is funding them and others. Hamas is funding them and others. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4600.26s)]
*  Pro-Palestinian. $20 million he wants for false imprisonment of a Muslim. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4607.9400000000005s)]
*  $20 million he wants for false imprisonment of malicious prosecution. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4614.34s)]
*  So of course, they're bringing in New York City because it's a scam. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4618.74s)]
*  It's a scam. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4624.42s)]
*  A DHS spokesperson called Khalil's claim absurd and said the Trump administration acted well [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4627.9400000000005s)]
*  within its legal authority. He's a 30-year-old permanent U.S. resident. They write a Palestinian [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4632.900000000001s)]
*  dissent. But he's not from the Palestinian territories, you know. He was arrested in [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4638.98s)]
*  March and detained for four months. Why? They don't tell you why. Why? [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4646.58s)]
*  I hope this will serve as deterrent for the administration, Khalil told Reuters on Thursday. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4654.66s)]
*  So now, the administration trying to comply with immigration law, the administration trying to kick [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4659.299999999999s)]
*  this ass out of the country. And for good reason. Now, they're the bad guys and now they're [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4666.1s)]
*  defending a $20 million suit. This is how these slip and fall lawyers operate. This is how these [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4672.9800000000005s)]
*  judges operate. He sparked an outcry, Reuters, from pro-Palestinian and civil rights groups who [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4677.860000000001s)]
*  said the government was wrongly conflating criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4688.02s)]
*  It had nothing to do with criticism of Israel. I just mentioned that idiot from Congress. I also [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4692.34s)]
*  mentioned the fraud room. Plenty of people who criticize Israel and harshly so. It's nothing to [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4698.82s)]
*  do with criticizing Israel. The activity that took place at Columbia University was violent. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4705.22s)]
*  It involved chasing Jews. It involved attacking a janitor and security personnel. It involved [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4714.82s)]
*  doing damages, damaging buildings. It involved disrupting classes. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4722.1s)]
*  In June, U.S. District Judge Michael Farberi is another loser. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4729.62s)]
*  He ruled in New Jersey that the Trump administration was violating [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4734.42s)]
*  Keneal's constitutional right to free speech. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4737.62s)]
*  Now, these places that the likes of Khalil hail from and wish to impose on us, they believe in [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4743.9400000000005s)]
*  free speech? I'm just curious. But our own media is full of crap. Look at AP, a recap of the trial [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4751.22s)]
*  over the Trump administration's crackdown on pro-Palestinian campus protesters. Pro-Palestinian. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4761.06s)]
*  Is that why they're pulling down the posters of hostages that Hamas has in tunnels because [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4768.5s)]
*  they're pro-Palestinian? Is that why they're burning the American flag and the Israeli flag [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4775.06s)]
*  because they're pro-Palestinian? Is that why they're damaging buildings? Is that why they're [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4780.18s)]
*  creating little tent cities? Is that why they're creating these crystal knocks on campus, really, [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4785.9400000000005s)]
*  because they're pro-Palestinian? It's amazing, isn't it? [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4790.740000000001s)]
*  Yet if we lose the culture and they win, there'll be no free speech. There'll be no mobility. There'll [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4801.14s)]
*  be no freedom of any kind. How do we know this? Because we see what goes on in these countries. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4809.06s)]
*  This guy wasn't born here. This guy came here. He came here to lead a revolution, [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4817.14s)]
*  revolution by immigration. We're not stupid. We know what's taking place. Now he's suing for [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4825.06s)]
*  $20 million. You'll get some jackass judge and jackass jury in Democrat City. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4831.38s)]
*  This is how they conduct themselves. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4839.06s)]
*  Pretty sick. Not surprising. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4845.22s)]
*  I want to move on to the 25th Amendment. I hit it quick a little bit. I'm not done. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4852.1s)]
*  Dr. Kevin O'Connor, he was the physician at the White House for Biden. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4856.1s)]
*  And he either lied to the American people or he didn't. Massive cover-up, massive cover-up, [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4862.9800000000005s)]
*  massive violation of their constitutional oaths. Vice President, not a single cabinet secretary, [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4868.02s)]
*  objected to what was taking place and sought to trigger the 25th Amendment, which is there for [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4873.54s)]
*  this precise reason. They did nothing. Cut 17, Mr. Producer. Go. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4879.94s)]
*  The questioning will proceed in rounds. The majority will ask questions for an hour and then [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4910.419999999999s)]
*  the minority will have an opportunity to ask questions for an hour if they choose. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4915.299999999999s)]
*  There will be one staff council per side asking the questions during each round. To the extent [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4919.62s)]
*  members have questions for the witness, they will be propounded during their sides' respective rounds. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4924.74s)]
*  Do you understand? [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4928.9s)]
*  I am not a lawyer and I must follow my lawyer's advice in this matter. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4940.58s)]
*  Yeah, okay. First of all, this has nothing to do with physician-patient privilege. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4943.94s)]
*  That's easily pierced. Nobody's asking [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4949.62s)]
*  a question related to that per se. We're not interested if Joe Biden had bleeding hemorrhoids. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4954.9s)]
*  We're interested if he was qualified to be president because this guy was signing [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4960.98s)]
*  letters telling us how competent he was. And those letters were obviously false. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4964.339999999999s)]
*  He's not a lawyer on competent counsel. His lawyer has a right to tell him to plead the 5th [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4970.66s)]
*  because he has nothing to say that can help him. That's the truth. Now, what should the committee [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4976.0199999999995s)]
*  do? The committee should do what other committees have done and they should give him immunity, [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4980.82s)]
*  at least transactional immunity, in which case he can't plead the 5th. He has to testify. Why? [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4986.74s)]
*  Because he's not criminally exposed. That's why. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4992.9s)]
*  And so give him his immunity. It's not a matter of putting this guy in prison. We want to get to the [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=4998.179999999999s)]
*  bottom of it, right, America? Right now, you can't put him in prison and you can't get to the bottom [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5002.42s)]
*  of it. So my view is give him immunity. It can be transactional. It can be limited immunity. I don't [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5006.9s)]
*  care if they give him full immunity. Give him immunity and make him testify because if they do, [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5014.179999999999s)]
*  he has to testify. He can't plead the 5th because there's nothing to plead the 5th to. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5019.62s)]
*  Mr. Comer, you hear what I'm saying? This is what you need to do in my [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5026.74s)]
*  experience, my opinion. Cut 19, go. Dr. O'Connor, were you ever told to lie about the president's [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5031.22s)]
*  health? On the advice of counsel, I must expect any decline to answer based upon physician-patient [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5038.98s)]
*  privilege and in reliance on my right under the 5th Amendment of the Constitution. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5045.7s)]

*  Let the record reflect that Dr. O'Connor has invoked the 5th Amendment right against [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5055.62s)]
*  self-incrimination. Dr. O'Connor, please be very clear. Are you declining to answer the question [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5059.62s)]
*  put to you solely on the ground that you believe the answer will incriminate you? [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5065.22s)]
*  On the advice of counsel, I must respectfully decline to answer based upon the physician's [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5069.22s)]

*  I am not a lawyer and I must rely on my lawyer's advice. This line about I am not a lawyer and I [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5079.139999999999s)]
*  must rely on my lawyer's advice in this matter, that is utterly unnecessary. So he's saying that. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5082.82s)]
*  That's a political statement to cover his ass. That's unnecessary. He can say on advice to [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5087.299999999999s)]
*  counsel, that's unnecessary too. He can just say, I plead the 5th. That's it. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5094.58s)]
*  I plead the 5th. I plead the 5th. I plead the 5th. But he does this whole thing. Go ahead. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5097.94s)]
*  Dr. O'Connor, did you ever believe the president was unfit to execute his duties as president? [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5106.66s)]
*  On the advice of counsel, we got it. We got it. We got it. He's a parrot. We got it. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5114.5s)]
*  I would never want to go to this doctor. Would you, Mr. Producer? [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5120.98s)]
*  Nope. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5124.42s)]
*  On the advice of counsel, I better not answer. I may wind up in prison. I'll be right back. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5126.9s)]
*  Mont Blanc. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5133.06s)]
*  David Shun is one of the great civil rights and constitutionalists [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5148.900000000001s)]
*  that is litigators that I've ever known. And I bring him on Fox from time to time. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5153.3s)]
*  And I wanted him to come on this evening because I've been talking about this Mahmoud Khalil [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5161.46s)]
*  and how he's going to sue the administration for $20 million because of the violation of his [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5166.1s)]
*  so-called civil rights. David Shun, what do you think of this guy? And is he going to get a day [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5172.26s)]
*  in court that he may not want? Well, that I hope. But I think the guy is 100% deportable. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5179.14s)]
*  I think he's deportable under 8 USC 1227 and 1182 combined because they specifically provide [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5187.22s)]
*  that a person is not permitted into the country or once in the country, a person is deportable. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5194.34s)]
*  If they support, endorse, encourage others to support, endorse a foreign terrorist organization, [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5199.54s)]
*  he certainly has done that with Hamas. We have a lawsuit going against him in the southern district [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5205.62s)]
*  New York right now under the Anti-Terrorism Act on behalf of some of the victims of the Hamas [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5211.06s)]
*  atrocities and some Columbia students based on his activities at Columbia. And I'll tell you this, [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5215.7s)]
*  one of the plaintiffs in the case is a former hostage. He told us that when he was being held [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5222.34s)]
*  hostage, his captors put up a picture on the TV and it was at Columbia. And they said, you see, [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5227.94s)]
*  our people are everywhere. The material this guy Khalil has used indicate coordination with Hamas, [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5233.7s)]
*  certainly active support and endorsement. I think the government was on the wrong track a [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5240.82s)]
*  little bit in his initial action against him by, you know, whether he committed a crime and so on. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5246.82s)]
*  They don't need to prove that he committed a crime. He's a person who has violated the law [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5252.42s)]
*  and is deportable under those sections that I mentioned. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5256.9s)]
*  Well, do they have access to the information you and your team have gathered? I mean, it would [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5261.219999999999s)]
*  seem to me they would be arguing that and put it front and center, no? [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5265.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, we've had some conversations about that. And, you know, listen, Tom Cotton actually [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5269.7s)]
*  used these sections a long time ago to call for the deportation of these kinds of folks. But, [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5275.139999999999s)]
*  you know, I think maybe because the government, you know, wanted to use some summary proceedings [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5280.82s)]
*  or something like that, they didn't want to go through the avenues under these sections, [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5285.54s)]
*  but they just have to do it. I mean, this guy's when he was released, he's being cheered, treated [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5289.38s)]
*  as if he's a hero. He's a guy who simply endorses terrorism without any question, in my view. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5294.58s)]
*  Neutrino, they treat him like he's Martin Luther King or something, you know. And your case, [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5300.66s)]
*  how's it proceeding? It's probably at a snail's pace like every other case. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5307.3s)]
*  Right. So we've just filed or filing an amended complaint this week. They're going to be filing [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5311.7s)]
*  motions to dismiss, they said already. They already filed one set of motions to dismiss, [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5316.5s)]
*  but, you know, it's the same group of lawyers that you see in many of these cases. They really [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5320.74s)]
*  don't seem to have any idea what they're doing. We filed something with the judge already that [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5326.34s)]
*  was completely misleading, but, you know, they drew a pretty good judge for them, I think. I [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5330.42s)]
*  intend to file, I haven't announced this publicly yet, but I intend to file a straight up civil [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5335.139999999999s)]
*  rights case against them because I think it's very important that the public understands the narrative, [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5339.54s)]
*  that these kinds of people are today's Ku Klux Klan. That's the way I feel about it. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5344.82s)]
*  And you're right. What's the difference? Seriously, I mean, well, what is the difference? [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5351.139999999999s)]
*  The difference is that society had learned to condemn the Ku Klux Klan and the neo-Nazis and [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5355.46s)]
*  so forth. And in this case, these guys have spent billions of dollars in foreign money [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5361.7s)]
*  trying to present themselves as the victims. And they're the victimizers, aren't they? [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5366.9s)]
*  They are. And they have a complete campaign of misinformation, disinformation. I mean, [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5372.5s)]
*  you see the interviews with these college kids who you would think have to be pretty bright going [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5376.9s)]
*  to top-notch schools. I mean, they come up with these cockney stories that Palestinians were on [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5381.0599999999995s)]
*  the land before Jews ever were there. I mean, it's just crazy stuff. Read Arafat's own stuff. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5387.62s)]
*  Read the PLO, you know, some of the founding members' statements about concocting this [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5392.74s)]
*  narrative of a Palestinian people and so on for political purposes. It's crazy stuff that's going [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5397.379999999999s)]
*  on to treat these people like heroes. Look, you see, it's not so far off from what we're seeing [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5404.34s)]
*  in New York with Mamdani now. Chuck Schumer congratulating the guy on his election. Now [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5408.5s)]
*  there's a group, I understand, rabbis from Mamdani. It's just crazy. Yeah, and there's Gerald Nadler, [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5413.9400000000005s)]
*  anything to stay in the house because the guy didn't want to work for living and obviously he's [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5420.34s)]
*  very busy in the cafeteria there. And so he's a guy, he's endorsed him. Yeah, let me ask you a [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5424.900000000001s)]
*  question. Jew to Jew, and I don't care, I want Gentiles to hear this. If you're Jewish, how the [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5432.82s)]
*  hell do you endorse a guy that talks about global intifada? How is that even possible? How stupid [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5437.54s)]
*  can you possibly be? No, it's really, I don't know if it's a matter of self-hating or what it is, [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5443.46s)]
*  or you don't understand the existential threat that these folks pose to not just Jews, but all [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5449.46s)]
*  people everywhere. It's crazy, but at some point, whether you feel they're Jewishness or not, [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5456.1s)]
*  we certainly, if not, if you're not observant or any way around the thing, you have to understand [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5462.5s)]
*  that these people are against your people, the Jewish people, period. Do they go around asking [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5467.22s)]
*  you if you're an observant Jew or not, or they just know you're a Jew? Just know you're a Jew. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5473.54s)]
*  And once it's the Jews, then they want to know about all Americans, don't they? Because [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5480.820000000001s)]
*  because this is really anti-Western, isn't it? That's what it is. Globalized intifada isn't [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5485.54s)]
*  just about killing Jews. It's about killing the West. It's about an alternative society. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5491.0599999999995s)]
*  Dan, a lovely one at that, isn't it? Back in the seventh century, [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5498.26s)]
*  the West is weak. You know, we have these rules and we even have people who have podcasts and [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5502.1s)]
*  platforms in our own country who some of whom are quasi respected or respected. This is due process. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5508.58s)]
*  And if you fight it, they have a right to free speech. This has nothing to do with either of [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5514.42s)]
*  those things. This is immigration law. That's what it is. You got guys coming in here lying. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5518.74s)]
*  You got guys involved in violent revolution or promoting it, promoting terrorists, the front [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5523.9400000000005s)]
*  groups for terrorist organizations. You kick their asses out of here. And there's nothing new about [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5528.74s)]
*  that in our country. That is the right to do that. Is there, David Schoen? 100% right. Mark, let me [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5533.7s)]
*  say you'd be one of the first ones I would imagine to say we have to have robust discussion in this [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5539.78s)]
*  country. That's what democracy is about and so on. This isn't about that. This isn't about free [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5545.7s)]
*  speech. As you say, this is about violence. This is about killing people. Nothing less, frankly. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5550.74s)]
*  This is about putting down your rights so that I can overtake them and have a completely, you know, [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5557.46s)]
*  different sort of world out there in which, you know, we control and you Jews and other people [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5562.179999999999s)]
*  and stuff are just not even second-class citizens. You shouldn't exist. That's what Hitler talked [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5568.42s)]
*  about. And these folks, listen, I don't hesitate to say that what the Hamas people did on October 7th, [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5573.22s)]
*  some of it was worse than anything we've ever heard about that Hitler doing. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5580.9s)]
*  So isn't that Yahoo told me in this interview is going to run Saturday, [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5586.02s)]
*  said there is a little difference. The Nazis tried to cover up what they did with mass graves and so [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5589.86s)]
*  forth. These people brought go cameras and so forth. They were videotaping it. They wanted the [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5595.3s)]
*  world to see it. They put it out on the internet. These are monsters. That is Hamas and those who [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5599.78s)]
*  support them. They're not civil rights leaders and they don't deserve a payday. David Schoen, [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5606.42s)]
*  thank you for everything you do, brother. God bless you. Thank you so much. God bless you. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5611.7s)]
*  He's a fantastic person. And he's right. This is the whole West. It's America under attack. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5616.58s)]
*  We'll be right back. They call him Mr. Right, Mr. Conservative and Mr. Constitution. But [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5621.86s)]
*  you can call him Mark at 877-381-3811. I say we take a few calls, Mr. Producer. What do you think? [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5632.5s)]
*  Let's go to Greg Fairfield, Ohio, XM satellite. How are you, Greg? [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5644.74s)]
*  I'm doing fantastic. It's a great honor to talk to you, Mr. Levin. I have two things I'd like to [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5649.06s)]
*  run by you if I could, please. Yes, sir. The first one is I wish this Zoran the Moron [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5654.5s)]
*  would come on to your show. It would be like watching The Exorcist. Your voice would be like [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5660.740000000001s)]
*  Virgo Holywater in his big Marxist ear. Didn't we try and get him on already, Mr. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5665.9400000000005s)]
*  Hickey? Let's try again. I think we asked for him to come on. Let's ask for him again. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5671.22s)]
*  They ignored us, but we'll try again. Thank you. Your voice would be Virgo Holywater in his big [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5676.02s)]
*  Marxist ear. That would be great to listen to that. The second thing I would like to bring to your [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5682.18s)]
*  attention, and feel free to write this down, sir, and use it as often as you would like me. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5686.900000000001s)]
*  Yes, let me write it down. I was thinking this stupid AOC and this hood rat crotchet, [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5691.22s)]
*  how dumb they are all the time. I just love listening to them and it shows you how ignorant [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5698.18s)]
*  they are. I got to looking the other day and I had the letters written down SQUAD. I'm thinking [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5702.18s)]
*  this has got to mean something because they think they're divas. They hate America and everything [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5707.860000000001s)]
*  about their socialist. I got to looking at every letter. I think I decoded what it actually means. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5712.02s)]
*  Spelling out SQUAD, this is great. You'll love this. SQUAD stands for Socialist Queens [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5718.34s)]
*  Under Mining American Dreams. That's what I come up with. You sound like Jesse Jackson there, man. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5725.46s)]
*  You know how to harmonize. I try to harmonize before you, sir. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5732.5s)]
*  Well, I appreciate you, man. Thank you for your call. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5739.22s)]
*  All right, let's keep going here. Let us go to Chris St. Cloud, Minnesota on the Mark Levin app. Go. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5743.38s)]
*  Hey, Mark. This is Chris from Minnesota. I agree with you about the Democrats [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5750.259999999999s)]
*  just grading the Americans and all of us. That shouldn't be happening. It should be Americans [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5758.34s)]
*  controlling the government, Americans doing the thing they want and standing up for myself. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5765.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm standing up for all the Republicans in the US, including radio station people that are [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5772.259999999999s)]
*  out there, including yourself and the producer. We all have a right to voice our opinion to the [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5778.9800000000005s)]
*  government. If we want our voice to be heard and say, deport these people, we can come out and say, [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5786.42s)]
*  deport these people. If they're doing stuff bad in our country, if they're doing stuff [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5793.3s)]
*  okay and good, then those have a right to be able to stay here. But those people out there, [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5799.7s)]
*  no matter what it is, should be deported because of their evil talk. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5806.26s)]
*  I'm with you. All right, brother. Thank you for your call. Appreciate it. Let's keep rolling, [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5811.62s)]
*  baby. Mark Lake Tahoe, California, XM satellite. How are you? [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5817.54s)]
*  I'm very well, Mark. I'm glad you took my call. I'm a retired lawyer and I've watched this [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5823.62s)]
*  testimony of Biden's doctor very carefully. I listened earlier tonight out here on the [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5829.54s)]
*  West Coast with the celebrity golf tournament taking place to your view on the Fifth Amendment [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5835.379999999999s)]
*  and the doctor-patient privilege. I would be interested if you could, and this is [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5842.0199999999995s)]
*  my colleagues have been talking to me all day, under what framework could that privilege be [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5849.0599999999995s)]
*  waived? There's always the crime fraud exception, as you know, being an attorney and you have to [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5856.26s)]
*  take these stupid CLE courses every damn year. So at a minimum, there's the crime fraud exception. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5863.7s)]
*  So if they think that there's some crime involved, and I would argue that if there's some significant [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5871.06s)]
*  constitutional issue involved, that can be waived. But all they have to do here is give them, [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5876.18s)]
*  counselors give them immunity. And the goal is to find out what the hell happened, right? [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5881.62s)]
*  Look, I completely agree with you, but it's a pretty long road, you know, to establish one. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5888.18s)]
*  And I understand your argument, and I respect that. But I don't think that ship is ever going [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5893.46s)]
*  to sail because- Which ship? What are we talking about? [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5899.22s)]
*  I'm talking about his assertion that your position is that he, you know- [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5902.9s)]
*  My position is I don't care. I'd give him immunity and force him to testify. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5909.22s)]
*  And the Supreme Court's made quite clear if you have immunity, you're required to testify. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5913.0599999999995s)]
*  But the problem is, immunity has got to relate to some, you know, crime. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5917.46s)]
*  And there's no- No, it doesn't. This is a congressional hearing. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5922.58s)]
*  It doesn't have to relate to any crime whatsoever. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5925.46s)]
*  All right. I stand corrected then. Anyway, your interview with Sean was great, Mark. Keep up the [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5928.5s)]
*  good work. And by the way, I cracked up on your take on the LA judge today about going to the- [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5933.7s)]
*  Very good, man. You're making- You're killing me. So anyway, thanks for taking my car, [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5940.5s)]
*  Cole. And I'm looking forward to your book. And- [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5944.58s)]
*  Calling in, buddy. I appreciate you. Appreciate it. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5948.179999999999s)]
*  Take care. You too. All right. Let's keep going here. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5952.179999999999s)]
*  Larry's back from Hope Sound, Florida. Larry, you were very good last time. Say [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5956.98s)]
*  goodbye. I'll let you back on the Mark Levin app. Go right ahead. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5960.74s)]
*  Thank you, Mark, for taking my call. Just actually a follow up to what you just [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5965.0599999999995s)]
*  talked to that attorney in California. Mark, would you explain to the audience what [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5969.219999999999s)]
*  the adverse inference is when you're doing a civil, you know, thing where there's- [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5977.219999999999s)]
*  they're being asked questions and if they answer in the fifth, that adverse [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5986.26s)]
*  inference can be taken, meaning that- Well, actually, a jury is not supposed [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5992.66s)]
*  to take into consideration any adverse interest, as you put it, if somebody asserts the Fifth Amendment. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=5998.0199999999995s)]
*  I thought that was a part of- in the civil proceedings, not in the criminal proceedings. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6008.34s)]
*  Well, in the civil proceeding, it'd be odd to take the Fifth Amendment because you're [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6014.34s)]
*  trying to protect yourself from criminal prosecution. So if you assert the Fifth [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6018.42s)]
*  Amendment in the civil proceeding, you know what happens? You lose. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6024.26s)]
*  No. See what I'm saying? [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6028.9800000000005s)]
*  OK, I understand. You lose. And if you're a party, [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6033.38s)]
*  you're not going to put a witness up who asserts the Fifth Amendment because they don't do you any [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6038.58s)]
*  good. But the Fifth Amendment's really intended to protect you from a criminal proceeding. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6041.94s)]
*  If you assert it in a civil proceeding, it's actually kind of nonsensical. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6049.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I'm aware personally of a case where in a civil bankruptcy proceeding, the Fifth was [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6056.9s)]
*  invoked. Well, they might have invoked the Fifth because they felt that by making some kind of a [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6063.78s)]
*  confession in a civil case, they'd be incriminating themselves criminally. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6068.98s)]
*  I guess that was it because the end of that was that the situation was referred for criminal [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6073.86s)]
*  prosecution. Yeah, that's the problem there. Yep. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6079.139999999999s)]
*  Larry, you're a good man. How are all my friends here? How's the- [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6082.9s)]
*  what's my favorite diner called there? I can't remember the name of the thing. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6088.179999999999s)]
*  Shame on me. Shame on me. Oh, Dixie Diner. How's the Dixie Diner doing? [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6091.86s)]
*  You're not going to believe this. I just left there for- I just had dinner there tonight. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6096.74s)]
*  I love that place. It's a great place. I mean- [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6101.38s)]
*  It's a great place. You've got great ladies there. You got Nicole and you've got Mindy. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6104.9800000000005s)]
*  You've got Troy. You've got Marta. Oh, they all work hard. Wonderful place. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6112.34s)]
*  Have I ever seen you there? Do I know who you are? [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6120.1s)]
*  We've talked a number of times, but I've yet to meet you. I look forward to that. Oh, yes, [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6122.099999999999s)]
*  I have met you. I think I said it once before. Barnes and Noble, you did one of your book [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6126.419999999999s)]
*  signings and we had a fun conversation because we were both wearing the same shirts from [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6131.379999999999s)]
*  Greg Norman. Oh, yeah. I love those Greg Norman shirts. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6138.259999999999s)]
*  Too bad he didn't make them anymore. All right, brother. Thank you for your call. You take care [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6141.46s)]
*  of yourself. Thank you. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6145.62s)]
*  Let's take another call, shall we? Do we have another call here? I can't even tell, Mr. Producer. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6150.5s)]
*  The Mark Levin at Barbara in Kansas. Barbara, how are you? [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6158.5s)]
*  I am fine, Mark. How are you? Very well, thank you. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6163.46s)]
*  I just wanted to reiterate because I had spoken to you two or three years ago when I lived in [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6168.74s)]
*  Galena, Kansas, and we just moved a couple of months ago and we were talking then and I heard [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6174.58s)]
*  you speaking, I think it was today in regard to how people could hate so much, whether it be the [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6180.98s)]
*  Jews or the Christians or anyone else to do the things they've done worldwide. I keep going back [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6187.0599999999995s)]
*  to the Bible and it's a jealousy thing. It goes way back to Abraham and his two sons and there [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6193.46s)]
*  would be enmity between the two and that's what's happening today. It's wrong. It's just so ugly and [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6198.9s)]
*  oh my God, I just want to cry sometimes when I hear you talking because you're such a kind [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6207.7s)]
*  soul and you don't believe in hatred like that. You're a sweetheart. It really bothers me and I'm [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6214.74s)]
*  blind so there's a lot of things. I don't even know what you look like. Yeah, that's okay. Trust me. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6221.379999999999s)]
*  But as long as my wife thinks I'm handsome, that's good by me. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6227.78s)]
*  I think you are. I just live with my son, my grown son and my husband, but they're not real good at [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6233.379999999999s)]
*  descriptive terminology. I always was because I was an artist before I went blind, but I enjoy [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6239.379999999999s)]
*  listening to you on the radio. No, thank you sweetheart. I really do. Well, thank you. You [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6245.78s)]
*  take care of yourself. I'll tell you what, Mr. Producer, let's get this lady's address. That's [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6253.54s)]
*  right. We're going to send her an audio version of the book when it comes out the next few weeks. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6260.0199999999995s)]
*  So let's get her address. Don't hang up, please. Don't hang up, please. We'll be right back. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6266.98s)]
*  Hey, Mark, you kept me alive. I did? Yeah. I was living in my car. I was in deep depression [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6283.54s)]
*  and the only thing that got me through the day was listening to you and Sean Hannity. It just [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6300.1s)]
*  somehow got me through the day. Wow. How are you feeling now? How are you doing? [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6303.86s)]
*  Well, I wrote a book when I was living in the car and I hope you don't mind I mention it because [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6308.34s)]
*  I mentioned you and Sean in the book. Go ahead. It's called, it's pretty crazy. It's a diary of [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6314.9800000000005s)]
*  a manic OCD bookseller. How are you doing now? Are you feeling better? Yeah, I am. I pulled myself [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6320.5s)]
*  together and so thank you. I thank Sean too. You're a very positive person and I believe all the [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6329.46s)]
*  stuff you say. God bless you. Thank you. One other thing, what do you think of John Cusek saying that [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6337.7s)]
*  Iran should have nuclear weapons? I think he's a complete freak, fraud and phony. I think he's a [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6347.54s)]
*  head case. That's what he is. One other quick thing, Mark. Why do you think the people in New York [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6352.9s)]
*  keep voting for this guy? Why do I think they voted for him this time? Well, first of all, there were [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6360.98s)]
*  you got 45 percent of the votes. Secondly, you got Cuomo, who's a moron. You got the mayor, [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6368.0199999999995s)]
*  who's moronic. Sliwa, who's very good. But among these three, if they all stay in, that's who's [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6372.58s)]
*  going to get elected. The Marxist Islamist and he says we're going to tax billionaires. Billionaires [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6377.62s)]
*  aren't going to stay there. They're all going to move Florida. And what I worry about is the small [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6383.78s)]
*  businesses there, the pizzerias and the delis and the plumbers and all the little businesses there. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6389.62s)]
*  When you go to New York, it's just bustling. It's fantastic. You look at New York, you look at the [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6396.66s)]
*  wealth they create. All the people are there from all walks of life. And this guy would go into the [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6402.0199999999995s)]
*  really the most important city, if not on earth, certainly in America, financial center, cultural [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6410.0199999999995s)]
*  center. I know people who don't live in New York make jokes about New York, but we know where we [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6416.0199999999995s)]
*  know we know all about New York. I'm a Philadelphian and I love my city, but you understand. So [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6421.139999999999s)]
*  the idea that this guy can slip through and this is how it always works. You know, none of these [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6426.98s)]
*  none of these these thugs ever get a majority vote. They get a third of the vote, they get 40% [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6431.62s)]
*  and then and then they take over and then they change the voting system and then they never lose. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6438.66s)]
*  That's what this punk is going to do if he gets in. And that's why many people are very worried [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6443.7s)]
*  about it. Even people who don't live in New York. I'm very worried about it. I don't live in New York, [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUPT8awOaT8&t=6448.58s)]
