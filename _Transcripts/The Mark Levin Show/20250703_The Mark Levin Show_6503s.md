Video Description: On Thursday’s Mark Levin Show, the economy is strong with robust job growth, low unemployment, minimal inflation, and declining prices for gas, food, and housing. The big, beautiful bill, now passed, has significant tax cuts and include more border security with increased ICE funding. There’s a lot more to do but we should take a victory lap. Also, the Battle of Lexington and Concord, fought on April 19, 1775, marked the start of the American Revolutionary War. This battle, sparked by the "shot heard 'round the world," ignited the American fight for independence and demonstrated the colonists' resolve against British rule. The American Revolutionary War also included key events like the Battle of Bunker Hill, where American militia, led by Dr. Joseph Warren, faced British forces. On Bunker Hill, colonists initially repelled attacks but retreated after exhausting gunpowder. Warren, a prominent Boston doctor and revolutionary, stayed, fought, and was killed, later identified by Paul Revere through dental work. The Declaration of Independence (July 4, 1776) formalized the ongoing war, expressing colonial resolve. Many are unaware of these events and their significance to the nation's identity. Later, ‘On Power’ explains that positive power is rooted in the sovereignty of God and the people and prioritizes the well-being of individuals over rulers. It underscores that a moral society is grounded in God-given truths, natural law, and unalienable rights, transcending any ruling class. An individual’s life philosophy, shaped by practices, values, beliefs, and faith, significantly influences their role in society. Faith is essential to positive power, fostering virtuous societies, yet it can be misused by despotic regimes to justify brutality, highlighting its dual potential.

# From Minutemen to Modern Day: The Spirit of Independence
**The Mark Levin Show:** [July 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE)
*  Ladies and gentlemen, this next segment of the podcast is brought to you by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=0.0s)]
*  For over 50 years, the Great Heritage Foundation has been America's outpost in Washington, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4.8s)]
*  fighting against the D.C. federal bureaucracy and working to secure a future that allows Americans [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=9.52s)]
*  to live the good life. For too long, common sense principles have been ignored by many of the very [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=14.64s)]
*  leaders claiming to fight for America, but the Heritage Foundation is proud to hold our leaders [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=19.28s)]
*  accountable and stand up for America's founding principles, paid for by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=23.6s)]
*  He's here. Now, broadcasting from the underground command post, deep in the bowels of a hidden [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=30.48s)]
*  bunker, somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=38.0s)]
*  we once again make contact with our leader, Mark LeVein. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  Hello America, Mark LeVein here, our number 877-381-3811, 877-381-3811. Another day to celebrate. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=120.0s)]
*  I mean, think about this, folks. Think about what's going on here. You see the jobs numbers? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=136.4s)]
*  More jobs created than expected. I mean, we hear this all the time under Trump, under Reagan, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=142.08s)]
*  same thing. I mean, you have effectively no unemployment. I mean, there's some, but it's [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=147.12s)]
*  so low statistically, that's hardly true. You have effectively no inflation. The price of gasoline [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  this holiday weekend is way down. The price of food in most instances is down. Obviously, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=159.28s)]
*  we always want to do better. Housing prices around the country are down. Depending on whether you're [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=167.52s)]
*  a buyer or seller, that's either good or bad. The point is the economy's chugging along, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=173.76s)]
*  and now with this bill that was passed, it is a massive tax cut across the board [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  with special focus on people who work with their hands, who serve other people, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=188.88s)]
*  and who have modest income. The Democrats have to keep talking about tax cuts for billionaires, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  because what else are they going to say? What else are they going to say? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=203.04s)]
*  So which tax cut is it for billionaires? Can somebody, at some point, one of these [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  reporters asked the Democrats, what tax cut is for billionaires? What are you talking about? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=214.64s)]
*  Now, there could be a tax cut that encompasses everybody that affects billionaires, but what is [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=220.64s)]
*  the tax cut for billionaires? Which one is it? Now, you don't know, and I don't know, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=224.64s)]
*  because there isn't one. So they keep saying tax cuts for billionaires. Well, which one is it? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=229.44s)]
*  There aren't any. They're liars. But you know they're liars. They are in their media. That's [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=235.52s)]
*  what they do. They lie. And I have a few goons, thugs, and knuckleheads in the Republican Party [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=241.04s)]
*  who do the same thing, just like the Israeli attack on Iran or our attack on the nuclear sites, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=249.44s)]
*  World War III. Katarlson was talking about that. Pardon me. Let's have Slob's name again. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=256.16s)]
*  O'Bannon was talking about it. Marjorie Trader Green still talking about it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=265.20000000000005s)]
*  They've become irrelevant. Irrelevant. The Democrats are either becoming irrelevant or, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=272.24s)]
*  depending on which one you listen to, more extremist. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=279.44s)]
*  They don't represent the American people. They hate you. They hate you. They lie to you incessantly. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=285.52s)]
*  I mean, President Trump is pushing through his agenda with the tiniest of margins in the House [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=295.28s)]
*  and the Senate, and you have to give a lot of credit to Mike Johnson. He's a hell of a speaker. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=300.24s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy was too, by the way. But this Mike Johnson, he's like the Houdini of legislation. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=306.32s)]
*  He's able to get these things done. It's unbelievable. It really is. Of course, he has [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=312.71999999999997s)]
*  the help of President Trump, but he's still the quarterback in the House of Representatives [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=317.44s)]
*  trying to serve the American people and the President and get this thing done. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=323.2s)]
*  And Thune over in the Senate did a very good job, too. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=328.72s)]
*  So sometimes we should take a victory lap. It's okay. Is there a lot more to do? Well, of course [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=334.88s)]
*  there is. There is a lot more to do. The lower courts were pushed back by the Supreme Court the [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=340.96000000000004s)]
*  other week. That's a good thing. A good thing. Parental, the role of parents and the raising of [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=351.12s)]
*  their children was supported by the Supreme Court. That is a good thing. This bill includes [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=360.08s)]
*  school choice. This is a good thing. It's a good thing. Do we need to slash spending? You better [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=365.2s)]
*  believe we do. But what did I write in the Liberty Amendments? Washington can't do it. It just can't [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=372.64s)]
*  do it. And so we need our states to step up, our state legislatures, don't we? And to begin the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=378.08s)]
*  process of capping and limiting the percentage of the GDP that the federal government can spend. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=388.0s)]
*  But you can't do that in a single budget bill all of a sudden with the tiniest of majorities. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=396.08s)]
*  This is the reality. And many of the people who are yammering away, they don't even support [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=401.68s)]
*  Convention of States. So you can of course support Convention of States and this bill at the same [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=407.76s)]
*  time, understanding reality. I said Washington can't do what needs to be done. That said, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=414.08s)]
*  the states can. It's fantastic what's taking place here. I'm very excited about it. Very [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=423.03999999999996s)]
*  excited about what the court has done. It's going to disappoint us. Don't worry. That time will come. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=432.32s)]
*  But right now, these decisions have been excellent. What's happened in the Middle East is superb, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=437.04s)]
*  absolutely superb, that a single American military personnel wounded, let alone killed, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=446.0s)]
*  in any of these actions. And Iran doesn't have a nuclear weapon or intercontinental ballistic [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=454.16s)]
*  missiles. These people were all wrong. They're a disgrace. The border is secure. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=461.12s)]
*  This bill is going to triple, basically, the number of ICE individuals and the ability to have [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=469.76s)]
*  detention centers and so forth to really push people out of this country who shouldn't be [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=477.6s)]
*  here in the first place. Terrible, horrible criminals in many cases. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=482.48s)]
*  You don't get enough credit. You, the American people, I haven't heard anybody thank you. I'm [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=491.28000000000003s)]
*  thanking you. Because, but for you, Donald Trump wouldn't be President of the United States. But [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=496.64s)]
*  for you, we wouldn't have a majority in the Senate and the House. You did this. You wanted it. You did [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=502.4s)]
*  it. You voted. And you got it. And you got it. All of you, and there were a lot of you, I'm told, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=508.08s)]
*  who called Capitol Hill last evening and through the night and into the early morning, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=519.76s)]
*  urging your representatives to vote for this bill. I'm told you had an impact. So I want to thank [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=525.84s)]
*  you. I'm not saying it's the impact or what percent. I'm just telling you, you had a very positive [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=530.64s)]
*  role. And I want to thank each and every one of you in this audience who did it. I have the best [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=536.3199999999999s)]
*  audience. You're the best folks. By far. You're just terrific. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=541.92s)]
*  Now, tomorrow, as you know, is Independence Day, July 4th, 2025. 249 years ago, people keep saying [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=546.5600000000001s)]
*  250, 249 years ago, the Declaration of Independence was signed after some pretty, pretty brilliant and [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=558.08s)]
*  debating that took place in Philadelphia in what was the State Assembly Building, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=570.24s)]
*  but we call Independence Hall now, the Second Continental Congress, the Second Continental [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=582.72s)]
*  Congress. And there are a lot of states that were very skeptical about [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=590.64s)]
*  jumping into this war, which already started. Lexington and Concord had already been fought. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=595.84s)]
*  Bunker Hill had already been fought. So you had several states, particularly in the South, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=602.1600000000001s)]
*  that were selling a lot of cotton to Britain saying, why are we getting into this fight? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=607.5200000000001s)]
*  They're not bothering us. But they did. So when we come back, I want to tell you a little bit [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=610.8000000000001s)]
*  about what took place 249 years and a few months ago at Lexington and Concord. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=619.68s)]
*  The shot heard around the world. You've heard that phrase just to give you a very short little [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=629.68s)]
*  history lesson. Many of you may already know this, but you're going to be celebrating tomorrow and [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=633.4399999999999s)]
*  throughout the week in our independence. And so I want to discuss this, albeit briefly. We'll be [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=639.92s)]
*  right back. President Trump is in Washington with a mandate from the American people to solve the [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=645.6800000000001s)]
*  border crisis, reverse the effects of Bidenflation and restore American greatness. But since January [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=658.4s)]
*  20, judges across our country have consistently been blocking President Trump's attempts to [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=663.9200000000001s)]
*  fulfill his mandate. The Heritage Foundation has been analyzing the situation and they've been able [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=669.28s)]
*  to identify the legal issues with these judges' actions, as well as the solutions that can end [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=674.64s)]
*  this potential crisis. Now to see the results of the Heritage's analysis for yourself, go to [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=680.0s)]
*  heritage.org slash Levin, heritage.org slash L-E-V-I-N. There you'll gain exclusive access [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=685.28s)]
*  to the Heritage Foundation's guide to solving the problem of limiting President Trump's executive [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=691.92s)]
*  actions. Stopping these judges might be the only way to protect Americans and take back our nation. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=697.04s)]
*  So go to heritage.org slash Levin, that's heritage.org slash L-E-V-I-N and get your free copy today. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=702.72s)]
*  That's heritage.org slash Levin, paid for by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=709.84s)]
*  Kind of a very fun show this evening, very patriotic. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=722.5600000000001s)]
*  Battlefields.org is a very great site. April 19, 1775. This is your history. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=726.0s)]
*  Facing an impending rebellion, British General Thomas Gage decided to seize weapons and gun [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=744.0s)]
*  powder being stored in Concord, Massachusetts, 20 miles northwest of Boston, to prevent violence. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=750.16s)]
*  Patriot spies soon got wind of Gage's plan. Paul Revere and other riders spread the word, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=759.52s)]
*  Dawes, of the 800 British regulars who were dispatched to Concord. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=765.52s)]
*  Departing Boston late in the evening of April 18, the King's troop marched into the small town [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=771.68s)]
*  of Lexington around 5 a.m. to find facing them a militia company of more than 70 men, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=777.6s)]
*  led by Captain John Parker. When the vanguard of the British force rushed forward upon the town [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=784.16s)]
*  green, Captain Parker immediately ordered his company to disperse. At some point a shot rang [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=790.32s)]
*  out, historians still debate who fired it, the nervous British soldiers fired a volley, killing [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=797.76s)]
*  27 and mortally wounding one of the retreating militiamen. The British column moved on towards [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=803.44s)]
*  Concord, leaving the dead, wounded, and dying in their wake. Parker and his men would have [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=810.72s)]
*  revenge later that afternoon. Arriving in Concord around 8 a.m., British commanders Francis Smith [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=817.5200000000001s)]
*  and John Pickaren ordered several companies, about 220 troops in all, to secure the North [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=825.2s)]
*  Bridge across the Concord River, and then continue on another mile to Barrett Farm, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=832.08s)]
*  where suspected cash of arms and powder were presumably located. But by the time the British [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=838.0s)]
*  arrived at the North Bridge, a growing assembly of close to 400 militia from Concord and the [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=844.32s)]
*  surrounding towns had gathered on the high ground overlooking the North Bridge. From their vantage [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=851.2800000000001s)]
*  point, their vantage point on the hill, they could see smoke rising from Concord, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=858.8s)]
*  the result of British burning some supplies that they had uncovered. Thinking the town was put to [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=864.24s)]
*  the torch, Lieutenant Joseph Hosmer of Concord shouted to his fellow officers, will you let them [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=869.92s)]
*  burn the town down? The decision was then made to take action. Colonel James Barrett ordered his [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=877.3599999999999s)]
*  companies to march upon the bridge, but not to fire upon the British soldiers unless first [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=883.76s)]
*  fired upon. The Acton Company, commanded by 30-year-old Captain Isaac Davis, was placed at the [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=888.96s)]
*  head of the column. When asked if they were prepared to confront the British troops, Davis said, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=896.4s)]
*  I haven't a man afraid to go. Now, first of all, isn't it amazing, these men of history that [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=901.68s)]
*  literally began the war for independence in 1775, nobody ever talks about them because nobody has [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=909.0400000000001s)]
*  ever heard of them because it's not taught. Colonel James Barrett, Lieutenant Joseph Hosmer, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=917.0400000000001s)]
*  just to some extent Captain Isaac Davis, 30 years old, they all put their lives on the line. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=926.72s)]
*  Incredible, incredible how much history we don't know and isn't taught. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=934.32s)]
*  So these minute men, and they were called minute men because in a minute's notice they were able to [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=939.12s)]
*  arm themselves and come to the core of the battle, the minute men formed up and marched down the hill. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=943.6800000000001s)]
*  As they did so, the British soldiers, intimidated by the colonial numbers and [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=949.44s)]
*  orderly advance, retreated to the opposite shore and prepared to defend themselves. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=954.1600000000001s)]
*  When Davis's company came within range, British soldiers opened fire, killing Isaac Davis [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=960.72s)]
*  and also Abner Hosmer, another Acton minute man. Major Buttrick of Concord shatter for God's sake's [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=965.92s)]
*  fire and the minute men replied with their own volley, killing three British soldiers and wounding [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=973.5999999999999s)]
*  nine others. This volley, this volley is considered the shot heard round the world at Concord. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=978.9599999999999s)]
*  The rest of the British troops retreated back to town. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=990.4000000000001s)]
*  Spith and Pickaren, the Brits, soon ordered a return to Boston which developed into a route [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=994.0s)]
*  as thousands of minute men patriots descended on the area as the British were attacked from all [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=999.2800000000001s)]
*  sides by swarms of angry minute men along with what is known as the Battle Road. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1004.48s)]
*  When they reached Lexington, John Parker and his men had their revenge, firing on the British [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1010.6400000000001s)]
*  regulars from behind cover. For the next 12 miles the British were continually ambushed [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1015.92s)]
*  by minute men shooting from behind trees, rock walls and buildings. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1021.36s)]
*  The emotions of this fight carried well beyond April 19, inspiring American warriors to rise up [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1025.76s)]
*  and fight again, even in the face of staggering odds against them. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1031.44s)]
*  Having heard of the morning fighting at Lexington, British General Gage ordered Lord Percy [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1037.44s)]
*  to march from Boston with a relief column. The column reached Smith and Pickaren's men on the [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1042.88s)]
*  eastern outskirts of Lexington, but minute men continued to pour in as word spread quickly [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1047.92s)]
*  throughout the area. Among these minute and militia companies were many African Americans, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1053.68s)]
*  both free and slave, who took up arms and fought alongside with their white neighbors. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1060.4s)]
*  The British conducted a running fight until they could get under the cover of British guns and ships [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1066.4s)]
*  anchored to the waterways surrounding Boston. By 8 p.m., it was clear that the day had been a [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1077.04s)]
*  disaster for the British. They lost 73 killed and many more wounded compared to the Patriots' loss of 49. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1082.72s)]
*  Concord poet Ralph Waldo Emerson, dubbed from the embattled farmers, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1089.68s)]
*  they were not American citizens yet. That would have to wait until 1776 [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1094.96s)]
*  and the Declaration of Independence, our Declaration of Independence from Britain. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1100.4s)]
*  Then Americans became American citizens. On April 19, 1775, they were simply loyal British subjects [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1105.28s)]
*  who believed that they were standing up to defend and fight for their rights. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1112.64s)]
*  In doing so, they changed the world forever. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1116.16s)]
*  Think about that. Lexington and Concord. I'll be right back. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1123.92s)]

*  That's not going to last very long. Now that said, I talked about Lexington and Concord. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1313.6799999999998s)]
*  There are other battles, of course, throughout the Revolutionary War. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1319.1999999999998s)]
*  Really big battles, important battles leading up to July 4, 1776. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1324.4799999999998s)]
*  And the Declaration of Independence. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1331.6000000000001s)]
*  So in other words, the war had begun. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1336.24s)]
*  And the declaration was a declaration by the people's representatives to the world. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1339.76s)]
*  Of what was taking place and why it was taking place. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1345.8400000000001s)]
*  That's where we get our declaration of war from. This was a declaration of war, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1349.68s)]
*  but the war had already begun. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1353.6000000000001s)]
*  And just fascinating things. I've talked about Dr. Joseph Warren and his role. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1355.1999999999998s)]
*  He was in his mid-30s. He was one of the great doctors, one of the leading doctors [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1361.76s)]
*  in Boston, the Boston area. And he had a tremendous reputation. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1368.7199999999998s)]
*  But he was also one of the leading revolutionaries. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1375.76s)]
*  Dr. Warren was much better known than George Washington at the time, because nobody knew [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1379.44s)]
*  who George Washington was. He was in Virginia. Again, we're talking about 1775. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1383.8400000000001s)]
*  And Warren was one of the leaders, along with Sam Adams and Paul Revere and some of the others on [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1391.68s)]
*  this secret group that they had organized. And he was one of the leaders of the Revolutionary [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1398.96s)]
*  Group that they had organized to basically push out the British. He was behind a number of the acts [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1407.52s)]
*  that led up to these early battles around Boston and then later New York. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1415.9199999999998s)]
*  And Joseph Warren was a remarkable man. Again, not only an exceptional doctor, but [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1423.84s)]
*  incredibly brave. And at the Battle of Bunker Hill, as he was [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1434.08s)]
*  one of those actually leading the militia and those who were armed against the British, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1442.56s)]
*  the Battle of Bunker Hill, the Americans took the high ground. And Breed's Hill is another aspect [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1451.36s)]
*  of it that people talk about. But let's stick with Bunker Hill, Battle of Bunker Hill. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1462.4s)]
*  I had a document in which Warren, as well as the Colonel and one other who were leading the [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1468.88s)]
*  American forces, such as they were, were begging the New York legislature for gunpowder. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1478.0s)]
*  The New York legislature didn't have enough gunpowder for New York. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1486.24s)]
*  Nonetheless, they knew that the British forces were coming. Those big British ships were parked, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1492.4s)]
*  docked, and they could see those ships from where they were based. They dug in [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1498.24s)]
*  and the British ran up the hill. They were pushed back by the Americans. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1507.8400000000001s)]
*  Weren't even called Americans back then. They were pushed back by the militia and so forth. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1514.4s)]
*  And they suffered fairly significant casualties. They made another run up the hill. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1518.16s)]
*  They made some penetration but were pushed back. They again suffered casualties. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1526.8000000000002s)]
*  And then the colonists ran out of gunpowder, Mr. Producer. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1534.3200000000002s)]
*  So the British charged again. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1540.96s)]
*  Many of the colonists, they fought, some of them hand-to-hand with swords and knives, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1542.64s)]
*  some of them still had pistols and so forth, but they eventually retreated. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1547.92s)]
*  Joseph Warren refused to retreat. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1554.0s)]
*  And he led what small numbers of men who stayed. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1560.16s)]
*  They continued to fight and they were killed. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1564.3200000000002s)]
*  In the case of Warren, they were looking for Warren. He had a bounty on his head. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1568.64s)]
*  And there he was with a sword. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1578.16s)]
*  And one of the, uh, the men who were there, they were called the British, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1584.0800000000002s)]
*  the British soldiers, and they were armed with a sword. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1588.48s)]
*  And one of the, uh, one of the British commanders took his pistol and shot him between the eyes. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1595.44s)]
*  Then they urinated on him. Then they butchered his body. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1605.3600000000001s)]
*  Later on, Paul Revere, who's a blacksmith, among other things, a great blacksmith, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1610.72s)]
*  I actually have a few of his pieces that he made in his day. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1616.88s)]
*  Well, he had also, he had also made some, some teeth for Joseph Warren, and [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1622.16s)]
*  that's how they identified his body, such as it was. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1630.88s)]
*  These were great men whose names are not known. It just frustrates the hell out of me. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1634.0800000000002s)]
*  It frustrates the hell out of me. The amount of money we pour into public education, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1642.24s)]
*  education generally, and how much is unknown, how little is known [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1646.0s)]

*  And because we won't be here on July 4th, I thought we'd play a little bit of music, [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1674.16s)]

*  In honor of those in 1775 and 1776 and the long revolutionary war that went on for almost eight [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=1683.04s)]

*  I encourage you to do that. I'm having a difficult time explaining communism, socialism and fascism [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2110.16s)]
*  without giving a time consuming history lesson. And recall you printed a explanation, a humorous [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2116.88s)]

*  have two cows, give one cow to your neighbor. Communism. You have two cows, give both cows to [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2141.68s)]
*  the government. They may give you some milk. Fascism. You have two cows, you can give all [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2146.96s)]
*  the milk to the government and the government sells it. Marxism. You have two cows, the government [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2153.04s)]
*  shoots you and takes both cows. Anarchism. You have two cows, keep both cows, shoot the government [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2158.4s)]
*  agent and steal another cow. Capitalism. You have two cows, sell one and buy a bull. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2165.28s)]

*  Reaganfoundation.org. You know, you've heard me talk about this book on power. You've heard me go [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2274.88s)]
*  through different aspects of it. I've explained that I've categorized power in different ways, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2287.28s)]
*  negative power, positive power, soft negative power, things of that sort, without overwhelming [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2296.96s)]
*  on the air. It's just easier to read it for yourselves. But I do want to touch on this issue [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2302.8s)]
*  of positive power because I've spent a lot of time on negative power. What exactly is positive power? [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2308.48s)]
*  Now you may have an inkling. Let's just take a little bit of time getting into this because [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2316.7200000000003s)]
*  what typically happens is I talk about this pre-order period and then the book comes out [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2322.72s)]
*  and we talk about it post-release for a period of time. And then the discussions that you and I have [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2328.0s)]
*  on the air, the Reagan Library, the different signings, but especially on the air, [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2335.68s)]
*  they seep into the consciousness of those who talk about these things. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2339.52s)]
*  Oppressor, oppressed. You never heard that discussed. Maybe you heard it in a classroom or [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2343.92s)]
*  something, but you never heard it discussed on cable TV or talk radio until we did that [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2349.2799999999997s)]
*  in American Marxism. You now hear this guy running for mayor in New York, people calling him a [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2355.4399999999996s)]
*  Marxist or a communist. That would never have happened prior to American Marxism. They kept [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2364.24s)]
*  calling them progressives or radicals or leftists or socialists. And you may recall here and on TV, [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2369.68s)]
*  I kept correcting them. Call them what they are. Call them what they are. You've heard the word [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2375.52s)]
*  status. The word status was really kind of an Aristotelian word, but I reintroduced it to [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2382.88s)]
*  modern-day America through liberty and tyranny. So status, oppressor, oppressed, Marxist. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2388.24s)]
*  You're going to learn other phrases that are in this book that will eventually take hold like [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2396.72s)]
*  positive power and negative power. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2401.3599999999997s)]
*  Authoritarian democracy. Wow. Authoritarian democracy. That is precisely what's being [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2405.9199999999996s)]
*  promoted in New York right now by this candidate. But let's look at positive power, chapter three, [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2412.96s)]
*  just for a second, because I know this is, I love this format more than any other. I really do. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2418.0s)]
*  And this is why. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2424.96s)]
*  Positive power starts from an altogether different premise than negative power. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2425.92s)]
*  God is the sovereign, and through God his children, that is the individual and the people, [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2431.76s)]
*  are sovereign. Thus power, properly understood and exercised in the context of government, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2438.0800000000004s)]
*  is about the well-being of the people. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2446.5600000000004s)]
*  And so forth. The people are the sovereign, not the governing authority, and importantly, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2449.28s)]
*  the belief in God-given eternal truths, natural law, unalienable rights, all phrases in your [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2453.04s)]
*  Declaration of Independence. That's the basis of a moral and virtuous society that transcends [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2458.4s)]
*  any of the other things that we have to do. And so, the people are the sovereign, not the [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2464.0s)]
*  governing authority, and the people are the sovereign, not the governing authority, and [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2469.12s)]
*  that's the basis of a moral and virtuous society that transcends any ruling class. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2474.48s)]
*  Now this first paragraph in chapter three really is the foundational paragraph for our [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2480.7200000000003s)]
*  whole American system. Society, culture. One's approach to life and role in society [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2488.48s)]
*  and more involves practices, decisions, values, and beliefs that together form one's life philosophy, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2496.8s)]
*  which results from learned, cognitive, reactionary, experiential, or even instinctive [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2503.04s)]
*  thought processes, and significantly, significantly, faith. Faith is a vital, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2508.88s)]
*  bear with me, my eyesight's not perfect, faith is a vital, if not the imperative influence in the [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2518.56s)]
*  life of the individual, a nation, and even in countries that are said to be secular, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2525.04s)]
*  and that formally or institutionally disclaim and seek to invalidate faith, [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2530.16s)]
*  including by indoctrination and force. And of course, faith as preached and practiced by [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2534.56s)]
*  certain religions or religious leaders, now and in the past, has been used by despots and despotic [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2539.84s)]
*  regimes, as other autocrats use power, power to brutalize, destroy, and kill. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2545.84s)]
*  You may ask, how can faith be both pivotal to positive power, yet a potential tool for [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2553.52s)]
*  a negative power? And so I point out, thus further inquiry is crucial. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2558.08s)]
*  Let us begin with the American Declaration of Independence. Now you can see why I decided to [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2563.44s)]
*  focus on this today, because tomorrow is the birthday of the Declaration of Independence. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2567.6s)]
*  It appeals to the laws of nature and of nature's God, and states, we hold these truths to be [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2574.0s)]
*  self-evident, that all men are created equal, they are endowed by their creator with certain [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2579.04s)]
*  unalienable rights, and among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2583.12s)]
*  The founders were men of science, reason, and experience, but they were also men of faith, [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2590.16s)]
*  who worshiped God. Even among the deists, namely Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2595.12s)]
*  they knew and professed the importance of faith in society and the establishment [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2601.3599999999997s)]
*  of the American Republic. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2605.44s)]
*  Reason cannot by itself, as I cite in Liberty and Tyranny, explain why there is reason. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2610.88s)]
*  Science cannot by itself explain why there is science. Man's discovery and application of [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2617.68s)]
*  science are products of reason. Reason and science can explain the existence of matter. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2623.04s)]
*  They cannot explain why there is matter. They can explain the existence of the universe, [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2627.92s)]
*  but they cannot explain why there is a universe. They can explain the existence of nature and [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2632.56s)]
*  the laws of physics, but they cannot explain why there is nature and the laws of physics. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2637.12s)]
*  They can explain the existence of life, but they cannot explain why there is life. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2642.64s)]
*  They can explain the existence of consciousness, but they cannot explain why there is consciousness. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2648.56s)]
*  Back to my book on power, the founders did not believe they [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2658.0s)]
*  They owe their origin to men and through men, but to a transcendent providence, that is, [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2661.28s)]
*  to a higher source than man. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2667.0800000000004s)]
*  God! [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2669.1600000000003s)]
*  Faith was fundamental to America's founding. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2670.1600000000003s)]
*  Indeed, Christianity was and is our nation's dominant religion. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2672.1600000000003s)]
*  Moreover, without Judaism there would be no Christianity. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2675.4s)]
*  So together, Judeo-Christian values and beliefs redounded throughout our society from the [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2678.6000000000004s)]
*  earliest days of the colonists and still do today. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2683.82s)]
*  One layperson put it this way, Judaism and Christianity have significantly influenced [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2688.92s)]
*  Western civilization. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2693.56s)]
*  The teachings have shaped ethical frameworks, legal systems and cultural norms. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2695.8s)]
*  The values derived by both faiths are evident in literature, art, philosophy throughout [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2700.6800000000003s)]
*  history. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2705.64s)]
*  Concepts like human rights and social justice and the dignity of life are rooted in those [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2706.64s)]
*  teachings. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2711.6s)]
*  Both religions advocate for compassion and moral integrity, impacting societal values. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2712.6s)]
*  Their contributions extend beyond religious fears, informing the development of Western [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2717.88s)]
*  thought and culture. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2722.96s)]
*  As America became a nation of United States, it was never intended to be nor would it ever [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2728.2200000000003s)]
*  become a fundamentalist religious state or theocracy, as one sees through the Muslim [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2734.92s)]
*  world and elsewhere. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2740.32s)]
*  It was never to be a repressive religious state that smothers alternative religious [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2741.32s)]
*  beliefs or a state that punished or silenced nonbelievers, atheists, agnostics. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2746.04s)]
*  On the contrary, early on, religious tests and requirements that existed in some of the [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2752.0s)]
*  colonies would quickly disappear. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2756.7999999999997s)]
*  Among other reasons, Judaism and Christianity do not seek to compel, let alone demand, doctrinal [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2761.24s)]
*  purity. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2766.36s)]
*  The United States is among the most religiously tolerant nations on earth. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2767.36s)]
*  In fact, it matters not at all what one does or does not believe to enjoy the freedoms [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2771.68s)]
*  and securities that American society offers and which are explicitly protected by our [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2776.9199999999996s)]
*  Constitution. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2783.68s)]
*  The first sentence of the First Amendment declares, [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2785.3199999999997s)]
*  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2788.24s)]
*  thereof. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2794.08s)]
*  The reason is the distinction recognized in American society between the relationship [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2795.16s)]
*  of faith and the individual, faith and the community, faith in the actual operation of [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2799.64s)]
*  government. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2805.0s)]
*  In short, faith, properly understood, creates a spiritual, moral, and psychological foundation [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2806.0s)]
*  which affects how the individual lives his life. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2811.4s)]
*  In America, it is typically a moderating force in one's life, checking the excesses of the [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2814.6s)]
*  darker side of humanity, which in turn contributes to the civility of society. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2819.6s)]
*  Even those who reject faith are not utterly devoid of its implications. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2828.1s)]
*  For example, one has regular interactions with others whose faith affects or sways the [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2833.46s)]
*  non-believer's behavior even without formally recognizing or accepting the faith itself. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2839.14s)]
*  Moreover, society is imbued with the influence of faith. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2845.1s)]
*  It is impossible to escape it. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2848.74s)]
*  Therefore, even for those who do not consciously or formally embrace a faith, the teaching [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2850.7s)]
*  and practicing of faith create the moral and value-based belief system of so many others [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2855.8599999999997s)]
*  in society. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2861.56s)]
*  This is an organic process, not theocratic or otherwise coercive. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2863.0s)]
*  You see what I'm saying there, Mr. Producer? [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2867.7s)]
*  In other words, it rubs off on a person. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2869.8999999999996s)]
*  You don't have to believe in anything. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2873.48s)]
*  But our society was founded on beliefs. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2876.2999999999997s)]
*  It's possible, for example, to have a biblical, a liturgical worldview or a more formal or [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2880.72s)]
*  orthodox faith, faith belief that is, perspective, and serve in the government without the desire, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2887.3399999999997s)]
*  purpose or conviction to impose that faith on others by governmental coercion. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2893.04s)]
*  That is negative power. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2897.12s)]
*  This is well understood in America, and there's a reason for it. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2898.8799999999997s)]
*  For example, as previously noted, Christianity is the majority faith in America, but it is [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2902.2s)]
*  not the country's official or formal religion. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2906.7599999999998s)]
*  In fact, Christianity does not preach political control over societies or administrative control [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2909.7s)]
*  over governments, unlike Islam, which does. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2915.14s)]
*  Thus, in America, the individual's pursuit of knowledge and science not only coexists [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2918.4199999999996s)]
*  with faith, but springs from the influences of faith and are part of man's internal makeup. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2923.06s)]
*  Therefore, positive power originates not from mankind's hand or mind, although certainly [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2930.06s)]
*  its practical and earthly application does, but its origin is transcendent and inherent. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2935.64s)]
*  When we speak of universal or eternal truths, like the golden rule, do unto others as you [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2941.64s)]
*  would have them do unto you, the Ten Commandments, thou shall not kill, etc. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2946.3399999999997s)]
*  Good and evil. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2952.6s)]
*  These are fundamentally moral precepts understood and ingrained in the human conscience and [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2954.5s)]
*  openly expressed in free and democratic societies. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2959.66s)]
*  They are known to be true throughout the world, including among those who are oppressed [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2963.0s)]
*  by tyrannical governments and regimes, by the less educated or uneducated, by people [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2966.74s)]
*  of all faiths or no faith. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2973.52s)]
*  This is not to say all individuals, cultures, or regimes adhere to these eternal truths. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2975.94s)]
*  Some are evil, power-hungry, irrational. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2980.78s)]
*  Man's existence is strewn with horrific examples of his cruelty, from ancient history to modern [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2984.28s)]
*  times. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2989.36s)]
*  And of course, man's imperfection is both well-known and well-established. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2990.92s)]
*  But knowing what is right from wrong is distinct from doing what is right rather than wrong. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=2994.92s)]
*  And I go on. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3003.6800000000003s)]
*  Is this an at least interesting, Mr. Producer? [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3005.3s)]
*  He wants me to keep going, but I can't. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3009.94s)]
*  So I delve into this even much more deeply. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3014.0s)]
*  Positive power. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3016.6200000000003s)]
*  This is the American psyche. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3017.6200000000003s)]
*  This is the American experiment. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3019.5s)]
*  This is America. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3021.48s)]
*  This is who we are. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3022.48s)]
*  And I delve into it in ways that I don't believe anybody ever has. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3023.96s)]
*  And same with negative power. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3027.7s)]
*  This is who they are. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3029.44s)]
*  Not you and me. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3032.64s)]
*  They. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3033.64s)]
*  Over there. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3034.64s)]
*  This is who they are. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3035.64s)]
*  And so there's a whole construct that I'm trying to unravel and explain. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3036.68s)]
*  And I take this whole term, power, which is a force. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3041.62s)]
*  Power is a force. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3048.62s)]
*  And I break it down in multiple ways. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3050.68s)]
*  Because I got to thinking, especially when I was injured and I was stuck in bed for two [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3053.68s)]
*  and a half months, you know, my mind starts rolling and so forth. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3057.08s)]
*  And I'm thinking, OK, liberty, tyranny, good, evil. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3061.12s)]
*  Rights, denial of rights. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3068.12s)]
*  We've talked about that. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3073.72s)]
*  And it's crucially important that we've talked about that. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3075.5s)]
*  And we always should. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3079.26s)]
*  And we talk about power at a surface level in a superficial way. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3082.46s)]
*  Well, we got that. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3086.1s)]
*  No. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3087.1s)]
*  The key is power. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3088.1s)]
*  That's the key. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3089.7400000000002s)]
*  That's the key to the Declaration of Independence. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3091.38s)]
*  When you read it, it talks about liberty, unalienable rights. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3093.34s)]
*  But it's power. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3096.32s)]
*  That's why they're rising up. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3097.32s)]
*  That's why they're declaring independence. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3098.38s)]
*  Power. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3100.5s)]
*  Power. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3101.5s)]
*  That's what they were debating. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3102.5s)]
*  Maybe not using the word power, but power at the Constitutional Convention. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3103.52s)]
*  When we look at the Islamists, whether they're in the Middle East or in our own country, [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3108.56s)]
*  whether they're running for mayor of New York, it's about power. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3112.92s)]
*  That's what affects your liberty. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3117.16s)]
*  That's what affects your rights. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3118.62s)]
*  Even though your liberty and rights are God given at the earthly level, decisions are [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3122.92s)]
*  made about how or whether they're exercised. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3130.24s)]
*  You have these rights as a child of God. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3135.14s)]
*  That's what the framers and the founders believed in their right. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3139.1s)]
*  That's the whole basis for our free society. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3142.5s)]
*  A fusion. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3145.8999999999996s)]
*  A fusion of faith, properly understood, and the Enlightenment. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3148.24s)]
*  And the Enlightenment. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3154.8599999999997s)]
*  If it were there, the Marxists and the Islamists, that's not what it's about. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3156.62s)]
*  It's about coercion. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3162.04s)]
*  And in the case of the Islamists, it's about the fundamentalism of their faith and coercion. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3163.04s)]
*  That's their fusion. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3168.4s)]
*  And so I try to take the complex, run it through my mind, and bring it out in a way that's [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3173.3199999999997s)]
*  understandable. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3180.92s)]
*  Otherwise, why even write the damn book, right? [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3181.92s)]
*  On Power. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3184.92s)]
*  When I'm dead and gone, I think this will be the book, if there's anything, that will [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3187.02s)]
*  be the legacy for what I do. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3194.1s)]
*  Luckily, my wife can't hear me right now. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3198.3s)]
*  She hates it when I talk this way. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3201.08s)]
*  She says, what are you talking about? [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3202.42s)]
*  Stop it. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3204.06s)]
*  This will be the book, On Power. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3208.5s)]
*  I've written many. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3209.86s)]
*  It's my 11th. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3211.02s)]
*  Mark, why do you write books? [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3213.02s)]
*  Because I want to. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3215.96s)]
*  Because I think they're important. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3216.96s)]
*  Because they provide a different platform for educating people. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3221.18s)]
*  I'll tell you something else. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3224.56s)]
*  It's kind of a secret, but not between us. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3227.56s)]
*  The book industry right now is very flat. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3229.96s)]
*  It's very flat. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3232.68s)]
*  I worry about the book industry. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3236.56s)]
*  I don't want it to be destroyed. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3238.16s)]
*  I don't want it to go away. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3239.48s)]
*  Because when it's all said and done, what I said here last Wednesday won't be remembered. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3243.88s)]
*  But what I wrote last year might be remembered. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3248.36s)]
*  You get the point, Mr. Producer? [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3252.2s)]
*  People need to see things, read things. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3256.16s)]
*  That's how you remember things. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3259.0s)]
*  So I encourage you to grab this book. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3262.2s)]
*  I think you're going to really, really learn a lot, get a lot out of it. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3266.04s)]
*  The value proposition is really great. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3269.68s)]
*  I mean, 24 bucks or less. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3272.0s)]

*  I hope you're enjoying this when I go through some of the passages in this book. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3356.08s)]
*  I do spend a lot of time, not in overabundance, but a lot of time in the Declaration because [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3360.84s)]
*  it is so foundational and so important to understand our society. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3367.6s)]
*  And I'm a little remiss in what I said earlier. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3374.92s)]
*  There is one part I want to talk about because the Declaration is what we're celebrating, [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3378.2s)]
*  our Declaration of Independence, our Declaration of Freedom tomorrow. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3383.2s)]
*  And there was another piece I meant to address. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3390.1s)]
*  But only have 30 seconds, so we will when we come back and then we'll get on with some [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3394.0s)]
*  other things. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3397.16s)]
*  But I think today is a special day. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3398.16s)]
*  And the lead up to July 4th, Independence Day. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3402.12s)]
*  So honestly, I don't want to waste it with little bits of news here and there that are [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3407.32s)]
*  floating around and somebody else decided that it was important to put on a website. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3410.6000000000004s)]

*  And so I was saying, I'd be remiss, I back on chapter three on power, but in this case [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3511.86s)]
*  it's positive power. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3518.7000000000003s)]
*  And I take a look at Marxism, the overlay of Marxism with so-called modern day progressivism [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3521.86s)]
*  or what I call and coined American Marxism, and keep thinking of this guy in New York [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3526.34s)]
*  as an example, is unmistakable. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3530.26s)]
*  Woodrow Wilson and his peers essentially plagiarized and customized large swaths of Marxist ideology [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3533.6600000000003s)]
*  and turned it into their own. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3538.78s)]
*  Now why is Wilson important? [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3540.26s)]
*  We've had this discussion. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3541.82s)]
*  He was one of the intellectual leaders of the so-called progressive movement about 50 [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3542.94s)]
*  years after Marx died, actually less than that, 35 or so years after Marx died, the [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3548.1400000000003s)]
*  end of the 1800s, into the 1900s. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3553.38s)]
*  He was the president of Princeton. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3556.5s)]
*  He'd been a professor and he became president of the United States in a three-way race. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3557.9s)]
*  That's how he slipped in and that's why I worry about New York. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3562.1000000000004s)]
*  And he was the one that first advanced the administrative state and all these other things [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3566.5s)]
*  which later on Franklin Roosevelt would seize on and really turn our economic system and [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3570.46s)]
*  constitution inside out. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3577.5800000000004s)]
*  So Wilson's a critical character in all this. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3580.2400000000002s)]
*  And what I'm pointing out is he wasn't particularly unique. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3583.02s)]
*  He basically plagiarized from Marx and changed a few things around. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3586.54s)]
*  Again, he insisted that Wilson, well let me put it this way, Wilson's break from the [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3592.6200000000003s)]
*  Declaration of Independence, he hated the Declaration and the Constitution. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3600.2999999999997s)]
*  And America's founding principles appears everywhere in his writings and speeches. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3603.8599999999997s)]
*  Again, he insisted that concepts like eternal truths, natural law, unalienable rights, all [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3607.4199999999996s)]
*  of which are in the Declaration, and they focus on the individual and free will rather [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3613.02s)]
*  than the state, were quaint relics applicable only to the time in which they were asserted. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3617.7s)]
*  They are neither relevant nor binding on the present or future, which are and will be in [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3623.8999999999996s)]
*  constant state of movement, manipulated and managed by masterminds. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3628.82s)]
*  Now understand, these are the Jamie Raskins, the Hakeem Jeffries, the Bernie Sanders, this [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3632.38s)]
*  guy running for mayor. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3637.38s)]
*  This is where their mind is. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3638.6400000000003s)]
*  This is where their mind is. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3642.1000000000004s)]
*  They feel absolutely no allegiance to the Declaration or the Constitution, whether they [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3643.1000000000004s)]
*  wave them around or not. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3646.98s)]
*  But I'm explaining why. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3649.1400000000003s)]
*  One need not be theoretical about the disastrous human consequences resulting from the abandonment [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3652.78s)]
*  of positive power. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3658.94s)]
*  What's positive power? [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3660.0600000000004s)]
*  I've described it earlier. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3661.3s)]
*  The sovereign God, we, the people, His children, we are the sovereigns of government, not the [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3664.9s)]
*  government, and so forth. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3671.9s)]
*  Nothing focuses the mind better, as I write, than the myriad real life examples over the [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3675.28s)]
*  last centuries so recurrently of human genocide, mass incarceration, the obliteration of civil [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3679.96s)]
*  liberties, widespread poverty, etc., rooted in the negative power of Marxist ideology, [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3685.34s)]
*  specifically in autocratic regimes generally. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3690.86s)]
*  This is why I've been saying to you, the problem when some guy says free buses and free public [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3694.06s)]
*  transportation and homes and food and all that, there's no context ever provided and [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3700.54s)]
*  they're not going to because the candidates that run against them, the media that cover [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3706.9s)]
*  it, they don't know how to do it. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3710.1000000000004s)]
*  It's sad. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3714.02s)]
*  It's sad. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3715.02s)]
*  You have to surrender your liberty. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3716.66s)]
*  You have to surrender, surrender your God-given unalienable rights to an autocrat. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3718.82s)]
*  Is it worth a free loaf of bread? [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3727.2599999999998s)]
*  Although its Western progeny is of a different degree and manner, it is nonetheless a poison [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3731.06s)]
*  that finds opportunity in the fissures and rifts of any democracy, eating away at its [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3735.82s)]
*  bedrock and framework. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3740.7599999999998s)]
*  This is the nature of the so-called progressive movement. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3743.84s)]
*  In Marxism, unlike for example Islam, there is no fusion of faith with coercion in that [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3746.92s)]
*  there is no faith or higher order with which to fuse. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3752.44s)]
*  Instead, Marxism replaces faith with a cult-like man-made order where there's no higher order [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3755.76s)]
*  than man or more precisely certain men. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3761.48s)]
*  Indeed, even reason is whatever man says it is or more specifically whatever the ruling [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3765.04s)]
*  class says it is. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3770.38s)]
*  Hence both faith and reason are repudiated. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3772.0s)]
*  There can be no conflict of ideas or interests, no compromises settling. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3776.0s)]
*  Conformity and uniformity of belief and behavior are essential to Marxism and Islamists as [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3780.64s)]
*  well as other forms of autocratic enforcement. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3786.72s)]
*  Point of fact, like Islamism, coercion is central to Marxism, as is the destruction [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3790.0s)]
*  and necessarily the advocates, tools and institutions of positive power, like the Declaration of [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3796.44s)]
*  Independence. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3803.44s)]
*  The result is the collusion of Marxists and Islamists on American college campuses demanding [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3805.44s)]
*  the eradication of Israel, America and the West. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3811.4s)]
*  The alliance is built by communist China with Islamist regimes such as Iran. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3815.36s)]
*  On the other hand, positive power nurtures that which Marxism, Islamism and like entities [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3820.96s)]
*  seek to eradicate, that is, the human spirit, virtue, self-consciousness, individual sovereignty [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3825.44s)]
*  and free will, unalienable rights, the competition of ideas, speech and debate, self-reliance [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3831.36s)]
*  and other attributes of human interaction and in a character that contribute to a moral, [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3836.92s)]
*  vibrant and healthy civil society. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3842.56s)]
*  In America today, like much of the West, most public debate about politics circles [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3846.22s)]
*  around who exercises power, almost to the exclusion of the meaning, purpose and nature [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3850.9399999999996s)]
*  of power, which are central to understanding positive power. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3856.7s)]
*  Although the who part of power is an essential area of inquiry and discussion, as I explained [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3862.18s)]
*  earlier in the book, it's not enough. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3867.8599999999997s)]
*  The former without more is to debate the issue of power on the terms of negative power, [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3872.7s)]
*  that is the abandonment of the quintessence of positive power and the civil society for [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3876.8999999999996s)]
*  a secular view of power unmoored from the principles that informed America's founders. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3884.02s)]
*  And I go on. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3889.7s)]
*  It's easier to read than it is for me to read it to you. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3891.22s)]
*  It's funny how the brain works. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3894.9399999999996s)]
*  I tell you, my mind goes into a thousand different places. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3896.62s)]
*  It's funny how the brain works. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3899.94s)]
*  The visual has a more lasting impact than what you hear. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3903.3s)]
*  Unless of course it's traumatic, but I'm not talking about that. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3910.7400000000002s)]
*  So you can sit there and listen to a lecture and it goes on and on. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3914.1s)]
*  It's kind of you're getting tired in one ear, one out the other. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3917.9s)]
*  There's a lot of people. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3920.3s)]
*  But if you read it, or you picture it, or you imagine it, you remember it. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3923.02s)]
*  There are experts who talk about memory, how to remember things, Mr. Producer, and the [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3930.66s)]
*  best way to remember things, very complicated things. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3934.66s)]
*  And most of them say the same thing, which is you've got to create illustrations or [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3938.62s)]
*  images in your mind. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3942.7s)]
*  Images are remembered. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3944.3799999999997s)]
*  The written word, when you read it, is remembered more than when somebody reads it to you. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3946.7799999999997s)]
*  That's the way it is. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3952.22s)]
*  And that's again why I love books. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3954.5s)]
*  That's why I love books. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3956.3799999999997s)]
*  Maybe I'm out of step, who knows? [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3961.8199999999997s)]
*  Could be. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3963.8999999999996s)]
*  But I hope you'll grab your copy of On Power. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3967.5s)]
*  I've spent a lot of time this evening going through different aspects of it. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3969.3399999999997s)]
*  I haven't even touched the surface, but you get a good flavor of this. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3972.7s)]
*  And I think you'll find it very intriguing. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3977.5s)]
*  This isn't paint by the numbers books. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3980.1s)]
*  Some publishers, that's what they pretty much want. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3982.58s)]
*  They want to put a famous name on it, catch it, sell it. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3984.74s)]
*  Then the next year, name, sell it. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3987.86s)]
*  Next year, ghostwriter, names. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3990.54s)]
*  I don't play those games. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3992.58s)]
*  This is not an assembly line. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3995.22s)]
*  I write when I want to write about what I want to write. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3996.46s)]
*  And I try and integrate like this book into the books that I've written previously. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=3999.62s)]
*  I'm not going to go into the details of the book. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4007.1s)]
*  I'm going to go into the details of the book. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4009.1s)]
*  I'm going to go into the details of the book. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4011.1s)]
*  I'm going to go into the details of the book. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4013.1s)]
*  I'm going to go into the details of the book. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4015.1s)]
*  I'm going to go into the details of the book. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4017.1s)]
*  I'm going to go into the details of the book. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4019.1s)]
*  I'm going to go into the details of the book. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4021.1s)]
*  I'm going to go into the details of the book. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4023.1s)]
*  I'm going to go into the details of the book. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4025.1s)]
*  I'm going to go into the details of the book. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4027.1s)]
*  I'm going to go into the details of the book. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4029.1s)]
*  I'm going to go into the details of the book. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4031.1s)]
*  I'm going to go into the details of the book. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4033.1s)]
*  I'm on the wrong side of this thing. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4035.1s)]
*  I'm on the wrong side of this thing. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4037.1s)]
*  I'm on the wrong side of this thing. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4039.1s)]
*  I'm on the wrong side of this thing. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4041.1s)]
*  And of course I supported it. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4043.1s)]
*  My approach with On Power is to emphasize, to focus more on the issue of power. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4045.1s)]
*  Not to the exclusion of liberty and rights or humanity, but to explain them. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4052.1s)]
*  And I think one of the chapters you're going to find extraordinarily interesting. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4059.1s)]
*  In my opinion, is the chapter on liberty. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4064.1s)]
*  I've written chapters on liberty before, but you know what I did on this chapter? [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4067.1s)]
*  I went to some of the greatest minds who discuss liberty. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4072.1s)]
*  Aristotle. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4080.1s)]
*  No greater mind than that. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4081.1s)]
*  I can't name them all, but some you've never heard of before. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4083.1s)]
*  Isaiah Berlin. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4089.1s)]
*  Brilliant man. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4091.1s)]
*  Fascinated by him. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4092.1s)]
*  Others. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4097.1s)]
*  John Stuart Mill wrote a whole book called On Liberty. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4098.1s)]
*  I tap into the founders and the framers who spent a lot of time talking about or writing about. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4103.1s)]
*  You know what I found out? [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4108.1s)]
*  And you're going to find out when you read the chapter. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4110.1s)]
*  Not one of them clearly defines liberty. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4113.1s)]
*  Pretty fascinating, don't you think? [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4118.1s)]
*  I don't think anybody else has come to that conclusion. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4120.1s)]
*  And I explain it. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4122.1s)]
*  It's not a criticism. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4123.1s)]
*  It's not a criticism. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4126.1s)]
*  Liberty is one of those words that's very difficult to define, and mostly defined by what it's not. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4127.1s)]
*  By what it's not. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4132.1s)]
*  Or in the context of something else. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4133.1s)]
*  That's my conclusion. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4135.1s)]
*  We kind of know what liberty is, don't we? [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4137.1s)]
*  We certainly know when it's under attack or when we don't have it. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4139.1s)]
*  I think you'll find this quite amazing, this chapter. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4145.1s)]
*  Very, very interesting. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4148.1s)]
*  I'll be right back. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4149.1s)]
*  Mud Club In. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4150.1s)]

*  When you delve into the things that we've been talking about tonight and then you come to clips with Hakeem Jeffries, I mean it's a real 50 steps down. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4228.1s)]
*  Isn't it, Mr. Professor? [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4237.1s)]
*  I mean, these guys screaming at the top of their lungs sound like a bunch of morons because they are. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4238.1s)]
*  Jamie Raskin. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4243.1s)]
*  I'll give you an example. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4245.1s)]
*  Here's Jamie Raskin. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4247.1s)]
*  Jamie Raskin has been pretending to be a constitutional expert for much of his adult life. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4248.1s)]
*  He was a so-called professor. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4254.1s)]
*  He's a disgrace. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4256.1s)]
*  And he won't come on this program because he knows I'll expose him. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4257.1s)]
*  That's why none of these people will come on the program. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4260.1s)]
*  Not one of them. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4262.1s)]
*  Bernie Sanders, AOC, Tlaib, none of them. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4264.1s)]
*  Not one of them. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4267.1s)]
*  But here he is yesterday on MSNBC. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4270.1s)]
*  Cut nine, go. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4273.1s)]
*  If the president is lecturing the Republicans that they should never touch Medicaid or Medicare or Social Security, he clearly does not know what's in his own bill. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4275.1s)]
*  And I didn't lob that at him as an accusation, but simply as a statement because he would. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4285.1s)]
*  Okay, dummy, dummy. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4290.1s)]
*  He doesn't touch Medicare and he doesn't touch Social Security except to give tax relief to Social Security recipients. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4292.1s)]
*  As for Medicaid, yes, he touches it. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4299.1s)]
*  He doesn't touch it for people who lawfully have a right to it, does he? [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4302.1s)]
*  Illegal aliens don't have a lawful right to be here, let alone to be using Medicaid and draining it out of its resources. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4306.1s)]
*  Moreover, able-bodied young men in their 30s and 20s, as well as young women who are mentally and physically able to work 20 hours a week and refuse, are not the people that Medicaid and insurance program for the poor and the needy were intended to help. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4312.1s)]
*  And they are draining resources out of Medicaid also. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4328.1s)]
*  So what the Republicans and Donald Trump are doing, they're saving Medicaid by throwing off the reprobates, the people on the dole, the illegal aliens and so forth. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4332.1s)]
*  I don't know how much more clearly to spell it out, but the clown's on MSNBC, so he will never be challenged. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4340.1s)]
*  He's there because he's a propagandist, because he's a Stalinist. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4346.1s)]
*  Do you understand? [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4350.1s)]
*  Take another shot at this. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4352.1s)]
*  Representative Robert Garcia, Democrat California, Mr. Producer, let's take a listen to him. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4354.1s)]
*  Go. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4359.1s)]
*  Is there anything in here that you see as potentially good, even as you warn of all of the bad pieces? [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4360.1s)]
*  No, because at the end of the day, even the things where there could be some agreement, for example, on taxing of tips, which there's been some bipartisan support, this it's not set up to be permanent. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4366.1s)]
*  It goes away. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4377.1s)]
*  It's complex for people to be able to report it. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4378.1s)]
*  OK, let me explain democracy, how that works. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4380.1s)]
*  We have elections every two years, one third of the Senate, all of the House. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4383.1s)]
*  Nothing can be permanent because each Congress has the power to undo what a prior Congress did. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4386.1s)]
*  Moron. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4392.1s)]
*  Now, if he's talking about the fact that they're in there temporarily, they're not in there forever, why does that matter since every Congress can do whatever it wants? [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4394.1s)]
*  And I suspect the reason they did that is in order to get it closer to a number that they wanted. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4401.1s)]
*  But that's not really an important matter, is it, America? [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4406.1s)]
*  No. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4410.1s)]
*  He calls this the largest transfer of wealth from the middle class to the ultra-rich. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4411.1s)]
*  So there he is with his Marxist pablum, absolute pablum, but that's not the case. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4416.1s)]
*  It's not the case. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4423.1s)]
*  Fifty percent of the people in this country don't pay taxes, income taxes. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4424.1s)]
*  They'll pay Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, but they don't pay income taxes. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4428.1s)]
*  So how what is he talking about? [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4433.1s)]
*  That's number one. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4435.1s)]
*  Number two, there's not a damn thing in that bill that transfers money from the middle class to the rich. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4436.1s)]
*  Where? [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4443.1s)]
*  What? Where are the specifics? [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4444.1s)]
*  Why don't they ever demand specifics? [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4445.1s)]
*  We'll be back. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4447.1s)]
*  He's here. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4453.1s)]
*  He's here. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4454.1s)]
*  Now, broadcasting from the underground command post, deep in the bowels of a hidden bunker, [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4456.1s)]
*  somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building, we once again make contact with our leader, [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4462.1s)]
*  Mark Levenne. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4469.1s)]
*  Any folks in their cars tonight traveling to whatever the destination is? [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4475.1s)]
*  I hope you're well. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4480.1s)]
*  I hope you're enjoying the program. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4482.1s)]
*  You know, I like to go, my wife and I like to go for like at the end of the summer. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4486.1s)]
*  I think three, four or five nights. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4492.1s)]
*  Ocean City, New Jersey. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4498.1s)]
*  Ventnor, Margate, New Jersey. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4502.1s)]
*  Now, when we were kids, our parents had a condominium, nothing elaborate in the least, in Atlantic City. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4506.1s)]
*  It was literally on the border with Ventnor. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4516.1s)]
*  And fantastic memories. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4522.1s)]
*  I mean, every day we'd run out to the beach, go in the ocean, and the shore, the beach in New Jersey is fantastic. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4524.1s)]
*  The sand is very soft and it's a big beach. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4535.1s)]
*  And we just would, we'd spend half the day there, if not more. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4539.1s)]
*  There was a pool that we used, but not as often. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4545.1s)]
*  A fantastic boardwalk. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4549.1s)]
*  This was in the hay day. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4553.1s)]
*  Well, Atlantic City's gone through many hay days, but this is about, well, several decades back. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4555.1s)]
*  The casinos were voted in, I think in the 70s, and they were pouring a ton of money in, and the boardwalk was all built up. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4563.1s)]
*  And you had all the big casinos from Las Vegas there and others as well. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4570.1s)]
*  And I'd sneak in there and play some blackjack, Mr. Producer. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4575.1s)]
*  Usually did pretty well. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4581.1s)]
*  I'm not that excited about it anymore, but I used to like it. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4583.1s)]
*  And then there was a million dollar pier and steel pier. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4587.1s)]
*  And we'd go on those piers and the rides were fantastic. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4591.1s)]
*  Well, those days, many of those days, they're gone. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4594.1s)]
*  It's too bad. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4598.1s)]
*  We have a great radio station there in Atlantic City, too. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4599.1s)]
*  I'm very proud of them. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4602.1s)]
*  They do a great job. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4603.1s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4605.1s)]
*  I'm very proud to be on that station because I spent a lot of time at Atlantic City. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4606.1s)]
*  We all did. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4612.1s)]
*  All the boys did. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4613.1s)]
*  And others, and other family members as well. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4614.1s)]
*  Great memories. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4617.1s)]
*  So when we can, I'd like to, you know, in fact, when the kids were a lot younger, we would, we'd drive on Route 40. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4618.1s)]
*  For those of you on the East Coast, New Jersey area, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and so forth. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4626.1s)]
*  We go 40 East. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4631.1s)]
*  I love that drive. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4633.1s)]
*  It used to be all farmland and with a few little towns here and there. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4634.1s)]
*  Of course, more and more is built up. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4640.1s)]
*  But there's still a lot of farmland and they have a rodeo over there. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4642.1s)]
*  Pretty big. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4645.1s)]
*  And what I particularly liked is you could stop at these vegetable and fruit stands because the Jersey tomatoes are unbelievable. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4646.1s)]
*  Same with the corn and same with the peaches. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4654.1s)]
*  But the tomatoes are like unbelievable. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4656.1s)]
*  People just eat them. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4658.1s)]
*  And we do always take a bunch of those home, too. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4661.1s)]
*  So it's very good memories. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4663.1s)]
*  I'm just sitting here thinking about the good memories. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4664.1s)]
*  I'm just sitting here thinking about the good memories. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4666.1s)]
*  If I were free this weekend, that's where we would be heading. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4668.1s)]
*  Probably over there. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4671.1s)]
*  Just because it's a lot of fun. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4672.1s)]
*  Yep. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4674.1s)]
*  They have a lot of nice diners. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4675.1s)]
*  I like diners. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4677.1s)]
*  I like diners. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4678.1s)]
*  You're in the diners. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4679.1s)]
*  I can be driving in the middle of nowhere. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4680.1s)]
*  If there's a diner, I'll pull in. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4683.1s)]
*  I'll sit at the people look at me like, doesn't he look familiar? [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4685.1s)]
*  I'm like, I'm not sure. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4688.1s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4690.1s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4691.1s)]

*  I'm not sure. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4693.1s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4694.1s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4695.1s)]
*  Do I look familiar? [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4696.1s)]
*  Are you who I think you are? [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4700.1s)]
*  How would you answer that, Mr. Producer? [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4704.1s)]
*  Yes. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4706.1s)]
*  You'd say you're Sean Hannity? [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4707.1s)]
*  I said, I think I am. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4711.1s)]
*  Anyway, that's... [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4713.1s)]
*  I just want to mention that because... [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4715.1s)]
*  Well... [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4717.1s)]
*  I just got something from the Social Security Administration. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4719.1s)]
*  Weirdest thing. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4722.1s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4723.1s)]
*  I'm not on Social Security. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4724.1s)]
*  Just so you know. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4726.1s)]
*  You know what else is weird while I'm talking to you folks? [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4728.1s)]
*  We're a family here. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4730.1s)]
*  People are not calling me old man, Mr. Producer. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4733.1s)]
*  Old man. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4736.1s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4737.1s)]
*  I'm not that old. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4738.1s)]
*  I mean, I know I'm not 32 years old or 28 years old or something. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4740.1s)]
*  Old man. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4744.1s)]
*  Wow. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4745.1s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4746.1s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4748.1s)]
*  Now, those are usually people that hate me. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4749.1s)]
*  I want to read something to you, particularly you seniors on Social Security. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4751.1s)]
*  This is put out by the Social Security Administration. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4757.1s)]
*  The Social Security Administration is celebrating the passage of the one big beautiful bill. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4760.1s)]
*  A landmark piece of legislation that delivers long awaited tax relief to millions of older Americans. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4765.1s)]
*  Here's what it does. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4771.1s)]
*  Ready? [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4772.1s)]
*  The bill ensures that nearly 90% of Social Security beneficiaries will no longer pay federal income taxes on social security. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4773.1s)]
*  And their benefits providing must be for billionaires, providing meaningful and immediate relief to seniors who spent a lifetime contributing to our nation's economy. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4781.1s)]
*  Quote, this is a historic step forward for America's senior said Social Security Commissioner Frank. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4791.1s)]
*  Whatever. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4798.1s)]
*  For nearly 90 years, Social Security has been a cornerstone of economic security for older Americans, he says. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4799.1s)]
*  And by significantly reducing the tax burdens on benefits, this legislation reaffirms President Trump's promise to protect Social Security and helps ensure that seniors can better enjoy the retirement they've earned. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4805.1s)]
*  The new law includes a provision that eliminates federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for most beneficiaries, providing relief to individuals and couples. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4819.1s)]
*  By the way, if you're a billionaire on Social Security, you don't get any relief. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4828.1s)]
*  Additionally, provides an enhanced deduction for taxpayers age 65 and older, ensuring that retirees can keep more of what they've earned. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4831.1s)]
*  Well, that doesn't sound like a tax cut for billionaires to me, Mr. Producer, does it to you? [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4843.1s)]
*  Now, they said tens of thousands of people are going to be killed. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4848.1s)]
*  They're going to die. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4852.1s)]
*  As a result of this bill, tens of thousands of people. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4854.1s)]
*  And you know what's going to happen, America? [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4858.1s)]
*  Come tomorrow. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4861.1s)]
*  Nobody's going to remember they made that bald face disgusting lie. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4862.1s)]
*  Millions of children will no longer have food. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4868.1s)]
*  Now, you know, that's not going to happen. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4873.1s)]
*  That's a lie, too. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4874.1s)]
*  Nobody will hold them to account. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4875.1s)]
*  None of these truly stupid people who we call so-called journalists on these newsrooms, truly stupid people, except for a couple exceptions, not many. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4876.1s)]
*  Are going to ever follow up with the Chris Murphy's of the world or the Hakeem Jeffries or the Jamie Raskins? [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4887.1s)]
*  It's a you know, seven weeks ago, you said this, didn't you? [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4893.1s)]
*  They won't do it. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4898.1s)]
*  They won't do it and they ought to do it. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4901.1s)]
*  All these people don't count. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4904.1s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4905.1s)]
*  We only attack Trump, Republicans and conservatives. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4906.1s)]
*  That's it. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4908.1s)]
*  That's it. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4910.1s)]
*  That's it. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4911.1s)]
*  Now, we're not going to we're not going to hold anybody to account that should be held to account, right? [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4913.1s)]
*  That's right. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4919.1s)]
*  We're not going to do it. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4920.1s)]
*  All right. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4921.1s)]
*  Let's see here. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4922.1s)]
*  Why the one Republican who voted against advancing the reconciliation bill looks really dumb right now. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4924.1s)]
*  Well, there's Massey and he's a. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4930.1s)]
*  See, Republican always a libertarian by Matt Vespa over at the town hall. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4935.1s)]
*  What's Matt have to say? [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4941.1s)]
*  Representative Brian Fitzpatrick, Republican, Pennsylvania. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4942.1s)]
*  You know, there used to be old jokes about Fitzpatrick, Mr. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4948.1s)]
*  But I won't do that here. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4951.1s)]
*  Representative Brian Fitzpatrick. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4954.1s)]
*  Now he represents like the Bucks County area. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4956.1s)]
*  I know these areas well. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4958.1s)]
*  It's sort of a liberal Republican area. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4959.1s)]
*  Marginal and can lean Democrat, lean Republican. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4961.1s)]
*  I think I heard it went for Biden or went for Kamala Harris or whatever. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4964.1s)]
*  But if it did, it wasn't by much. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4970.1s)]
*  He's the party goober. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4973.1s)]
*  Right now, he was part of a five o block that was against advancing the reconciliation packets that cuts taxes, kicks illegals off Medicaid, secures our border and, by the way, gives Social Security recipients a chance to get their money back. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4976.1s)]
*  It's a big break. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4989.1s)]
*  He's willing to set fire to all that. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4990.1s)]
*  All of President Trump and the GOP's top domestic action items over Ukraine war funding. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4992.1s)]
*  I'm not kidding, he says. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4997.1s)]
*  Actually, it was more than that, Matt. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=4999.1s)]
*  He went along with the lie that Medicaid was being cut. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5003.1s)]
*  That is, the people who Medicaid is intended to cover. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5006.1s)]
*  He went along with that, too. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5009.1s)]
*  As well as other things, according to the speaker. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5012.1s)]
*  So it wasn't just Ukraine, but there were other things. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5014.1s)]
*  But this guy, I mean, he really looks stupid now, doesn't he? [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5017.1s)]
*  And the Democrats are going to use Republican talking points against him in that particular district. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5024.1s)]
*  They're going to say, well, you voted for tax increases across the board. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5030.1s)]
*  You didn't vote to give tax relief to senior citizens, the people who get tips like waiters and waitresses. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5035.1s)]
*  You didn't you didn't vote to give relief to people who are earning overtime or working very hard. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5040.1s)]
*  All that stuff. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5045.1s)]
*  All that stuff the Republicans are going to use against Democrats and should. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5048.1s)]
*  Will now be used against Fitzpatrick. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5052.1s)]
*  Against Fitzpatrick. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5056.1s)]
*  The Victoria Sparks, Republican of Indiana. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5058.1s)]
*  I don't mean to be offensive. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5061.1s)]
*  She sounds like a lunatic to me. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5063.1s)]
*  She's sort of in the Marjorie Trader Green category. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5066.1s)]
*  Do you know what I mean, Mr. Producer? [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5070.1s)]
*  In that category. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5072.1s)]
*  But I've always said, you know. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5075.1s)]
*  I better not say what I've always said. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5079.1s)]
*  That won't go down right. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5081.1s)]
*  And so you have some of these people and. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5083.1s)]
*  But at least Matt Gates wasn't there. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5087.1s)]
*  You know, Gates Gates made a personal vendetta going after Kevin McCarthy. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5089.1s)]
*  Because Kevin McCarthy wouldn't shut down an ethics investigation and Kevin McCarthy didn't have the power to shut down an ethics investigation. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5094.1s)]
*  And now we know why, since that information has been released, which is why I call him No Pants Gates. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5102.1s)]
*  What a disgusting sleazeball. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5108.1s)]
*  Folks, look, politics aside. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5109.1s)]
*  Politics aside, what a disgusting sleazeball. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5114.1s)]
*  It's like Fatboy. What's his name? [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5119.1s)]
*  Manon. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5121.1s)]
*  What a. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5122.1s)]
*  Disgusting sleazeball. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5124.1s)]
*  Ripping off patriots who are donating money to a charity. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5125.1s)]
*  We says they're going to build a wall. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5129.1s)]
*  He just pleaded guilty to fraud in February and people don't even know that. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5131.1s)]
*  There's Bannon and the media love it. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5138.1s)]
*  They promote the hell out of these guys. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5140.1s)]
*  All right. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5142.1s)]
*  I'm not going to bring the show down. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5143.1s)]
*  I'm going to bring this show down. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5145.1s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5147.1s)]
*  Mudd. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5148.1s)]
*  Love. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5149.1s)]
*  In. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5150.1s)]
*  Oh, I feel bad now. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5159.1s)]
*  I want to apologize to Representative Sparks. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5165.1s)]
*  Nobody's as dumb as the other one. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5168.1s)]
*  I can't remember her name again. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5170.1s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5172.1s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5175.1s)]
*  I said nobody is dumb as the other one. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5176.1s)]
*  Sparks is. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5179.1s)]
*  So I'm apologizing to Sparks. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5182.1s)]
*  Because I put her in the same category as. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5184.1s)]
*  Green and really nobody else is in that category. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5187.1s)]
*  All right. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5190.1s)]
*  Let's let's keep our chins up here. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5191.1s)]
*  Let's let's keep it up. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5193.1s)]
*  I've got two very interesting here. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5195.1s)]
*  National View online FBI shutdown probe into alleged Chinese 2020 election interference to protect Ray documents show. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5197.1s)]
*  And then a CIA one. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5205.1s)]
*  Now this is big stuff. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5207.1s)]
*  James Lynch, identity. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5210.1s)]
*  James Lynch at NRO. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5212.1s)]
*  The FBI shut down an investigation into an alleged Chinese Communist Party plot to interfere with the 2020 election because the scheme would have contradicted then FBI Director Christopher Ray's congressional testimony newly released documents show. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5215.1s)]
*  Chuck Grassley re released internal FBI documents showing how the FBI suppressed intelligence about a suspected Communist Chinese Party attempt to create fake driver's licenses and manufacture mail and votes for Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5229.1s)]
*  You hear this folks? [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5246.1s)]
*  This is real. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5247.1s)]
*  This isn't fake. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5248.1s)]
*  The FBI suppressed an intelligence report from the Albany, New York field office produced in the summer 2020 based on information from a confidential human source alleging the Chinese government was producing tens of thousands. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5250.1s)]
*  What's with these ads for God's sakes? [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5263.1s)]
*  Got it. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5267.1s)]
*  Tens of thousands of drivers licenses for the scheme. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5268.1s)]
*  But the document was buried and its allegations were never investigated because Ray's September 2020 congressional testimony claiming there were no there was no historical evidence of nationwide mail and voter fraud campaigns. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5271.1s)]
*  How do you like that America? [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5287.1s)]
*  So at least here's evidence. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5289.1s)]
*  Yeah, we'll go to Donald Trump live right now. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5291.1s)]
*  Go ahead. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5293.1s)]
*  18 months ago, the people of Iowa braved subzero temperatures. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5295.1s)]
*  You remember that night? [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5300.1s)]
*  Oh, that was cold. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5301.1s)]
*  It was cold, but we were warm inside because we won by a landslide to turn out the first in the nation caucuses and you delivered 98 out of 99 counties. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5303.1s)]
*  What the hell county didn't what's the name of that? [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5315.1s)]
*  Let's get them out of here. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5319.1s)]
*  98 out of 99. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5321.1s)]
*  That's not bad, Susie, I guess. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5324.1s)]
*  Right? [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5326.1s)]
*  We'll take that. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5327.1s)]
*  But for president of the United States, Donald J. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5328.1s)]
*  Trump, thank you very much. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5331.1s)]
*  Everybody. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5332.1s)]
*  Then in November, we won Iowa by a landslide, 13 points. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5336.1s)]
*  And it was the single largest presidential victory in your state's history. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5342.1s)]
*  That's not bad. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5348.1s)]
*  And now we're back where it all started to celebrate five months of incredible success for our nation and wish the Iowans and all Americans a very happy Fourth of July. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5351.1s)]
*  It's an honor to be with you. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5362.1s)]
*  You know, a lot of people wanted us when you're president, they want you. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5368.1s)]
*  And if you're not president, they don't want you so much. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5371.1s)]
*  But they really wanted us. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5373.1s)]
*  And I said, Nope, I'm going to Iowa because I promised I would go to Iowa. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5375.1s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5378.1s)]
*  I said, No way. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5380.1s)]
*  There could be no better birthday present for America than the phenomenal victory we achieved just hours ago when Congress passed the one big, beautiful bill to make America great again. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5382.1s)]
*  And in the last election, the people gave us a historic mandate to cut taxes, raise take home pay, bring back jobs, stop the invasion, that horrible invasion. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5394.1s)]
*  Who would do that? [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5409.1s)]
*  Who would do that? [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5411.1s)]
*  That horrible? [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5412.1s)]
*  Who would do that to us? [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5413.1s)]
*  Who would do that to us? [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5414.1s)]
*  Who would do that to us? [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5416.1s)]
*  Deport the illegals and slash hundreds of billions of dollars of waste and fraud. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5419.1s)]
*  And that's what we're doing with this bill. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5424.1s)]
*  Every major promise I made to the people of Iowa in 2024 became a promise kept. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5427.1s)]
*  You know, we actually they had a report today on some crazy fake station, but it wasn't fake in this regard. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5432.1s)]
*  They said, You know, this guy actually did more than he promised. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5439.1s)]
*  I did. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5443.1s)]
*  And I have another hat back there. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5446.1s)]
*  It says Donald Trump was right about everything. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5451.1s)]
*  And I said, I said, No, no, that sounds a little too conceited, but it happens to be true. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5454.1s)]
*  I must say this bill includes the largest tax cut in American history. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5461.1s)]
*  The largest spending cut in American history. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5467.1s)]
*  The largest border security investment in American history, although I must tell you, [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5473.1s)]
*  if you saw last month, they had zero people coming through our borders. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5478.1s)]
*  I'm not sure that's even possible. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5484.1s)]
*  You know, I'll take it. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5488.1s)]
*  But somebody must think the other character had hundreds of thousands of people every time. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5489.1s)]
*  Sometimes in a day, they'd have over 100,000. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5495.1s)]
*  We had zero. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5497.1s)]
*  I don't know for the month. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5498.1s)]
*  So it must be a little wrong. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5499.1s)]
*  Maybe they had two or three or something, but I'll take the zero. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5501.1s)]
*  And the group that makes up those stats, you know, they're radical left Democrats. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5505.1s)]
*  So it's probably true. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5509.1s)]
*  We did a great job in the border. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5510.1s)]
*  The largest welfare reforms and military upgrades in modern times. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5512.1s)]
*  That's what we're doing. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5516.1s)]
*  We rebuilt our military in 2016. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5517.1s)]
*  In their first term, we rebuilt it. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5519.1s)]
*  They gave some of it away to Afghanistan on the most embarrassing day in the history of our country. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5523.1s)]
*  Do you remember that? [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5529.1s)]
*  We remember that. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5531.1s)]
*  We don't have days like that. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5532.1s)]
*  We have days like we just had in Iran. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5533.1s)]
*  That's the kind of days we have. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5535.1s)]
*  Complete obliteration. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5537.1s)]
*  It turned out that was complete obliteration. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5541.1s)]
*  Think of these guys flying way up in the air in a dark night, no moon, no nothing. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5544.1s)]
*  And they hit every single target. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5548.1s)]
*  It's a science of one hand. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5551.1s)]
*  Unfortunately, we have to take a short break. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5552.1s)]
*  When we come back, if the president's still speaking, we will go to the president [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5554.1s)]
*  because this is fascinating to me. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5558.1s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5559.1s)]
*  Nobody says it better than Mark Levin. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5563.1s)]
*  I'll go with what Mark Levin said because nobody could say it better. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5567.1s)]
*  Call in now at 877-381-3811. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5570.1s)]

*  Grab your copy of On Power. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5611.1s)]
*  We spent a lot of time on it this show. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5613.1s)]
*  Not enough to go through all the book, just little pieces of it. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5615.1s)]
*  I hope you're intrigued by it. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5618.1s)]
*  It's On Power. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5620.1s)]
*  It's a very, very good value for the price. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5621.1s)]
*  I mean, it's a very low-priced book. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5624.1s)]
*  On Power. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5627.1s)]
*  And we'll be getting back to the President in a moment. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5628.1s)]
*  Let's go back to the President. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5631.1s)]
*  We should have had it. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5633.1s)]
*  It was all set up to go. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5635.1s)]
*  And then Biden canceled the order when he came in. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5636.1s)]
*  But he canceled a lot of orders because he didn't know what the hell he was doing. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5639.1s)]
*  There's a case that would have never happened. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5643.1s)]
*  Bells would have gone off. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5646.1s)]

*  Very simply, the one big beautiful bill would deliver the strongest border on Earth, [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5652.1s)]
*  the strongest economy on Earth, the strongest military on Earth, [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5656.1s)]

*  in the history of the presidency. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5677.1s)]

*  No, I said, really? [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5687.1s)]
*  I said, better than Washington? [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5689.1s)]
*  They said, yes, sir. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5692.1s)]
*  I said, better than honest Abe Lincoln? [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5694.1s)]
*  They said, yes, sir. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5696.1s)]
*  I said, I like this guy that said that. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5698.1s)]
*  That's a smart guy. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5700.1s)]
*  He's up for a big promotion right now. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5702.1s)]
*  But just a few months ago, our country was cold as ice. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5704.1s)]
*  We were laughed at all over the world. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5708.1s)]
*  We were laughed at. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5710.1s)]
*  Think of it, a year ago, we were laughed at. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5711.1s)]
*  We were a bunch of clowns. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5713.1s)]
*  They were laughing at our president. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5715.1s)]
*  They were laughing at everything having to do with our country. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5717.1s)]
*  I was in Saudi Arabia. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5720.1s)]
*  I was in Qatar. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5722.1s)]
*  I was in UAE. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5723.1s)]
*  Great leaders, strong, powerful, very rich leaders, too, by the way. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5724.1s)]
*  But great leaders, very smart people. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5729.1s)]
*  And they said to me, the king of Saudi Arabia, but the three said the same thing, essentially. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5731.1s)]
*  They said, you know, a year ago, we thought your country was finished. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5736.1s)]
*  We thought it was dead. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5740.1s)]
*  Dead. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5741.1s)]
*  Horrible word. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5742.1s)]
*  Dead. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5743.1s)]
*  And they were right. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5744.1s)]
*  The country was close to death. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5745.1s)]
*  And he said, and you know what? [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5747.1s)]
*  You've been in there. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5749.1s)]
*  At that time, it was four and a half months. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5750.1s)]
*  It was a couple of months ago. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5752.1s)]
*  He said, right now, you're in the hottest country anywhere in the world. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5753.1s)]
*  There's no country in the world. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5760.1s)]
*  You talk about all over the world. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5761.1s)]
*  You got the hottest, smartest, sharpest country. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5763.1s)]
*  And by the way, look at our stock market. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5766.1s)]
*  We're taking in hundreds of billions of dollars on tariffs with no inflation. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5768.1s)]
*  And today we just set another record, the highest stock market in history. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5774.1s)]
*  No inflation. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5778.1s)]
*  And one of the great economists from the Wharton School of Finance, where I happened to go, he apologized. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5781.1s)]
*  He says, you know, I think Trump outsmarted us all. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5787.1s)]
*  And yesterday was the poll. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5790.1s)]
*  And out of 77 economists, I came in second. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5792.1s)]
*  I want to find the guy that came in first. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5798.1s)]
*  Somebody came in first. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5801.1s)]
*  Can you believe it? [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5802.1s)]
*  But we said what was going to happen, and it's happening. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5803.1s)]
*  And I'll tell you what, we had the greatest economy in the history of my first term. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5806.1s)]
*  This is going to blow it away. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5810.1s)]
*  You watch. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5811.1s)]
*  This is going to blow it away. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5812.1s)]
*  For the first time in years, this Fourth of July, the economy is roaring. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5814.1s)]
*  Incomes are soaring. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5819.1s)]
*  Wages are up. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5820.1s)]
*  Prices are down. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5821.1s)]
*  Gasoline. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5823.1s)]
*  You see what's going on with gasoline? [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5824.1s)]
*  It's way down. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5826.1s)]
*  See what's going on with eggs. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5827.1s)]
*  Eggs are way down. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5829.1s)]
*  Eggs. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5830.1s)]
*  Remember I came in my first week? [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5831.1s)]
*  The fake news. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5833.1s)]
*  Those guys right there. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5834.1s)]
*  Look at all of them. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5835.1s)]
*  Wow. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5836.1s)]
*  Wow. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5837.1s)]
*  Wow. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5838.1s)]
*  No, a lot of fake. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5839.1s)]
*  No, but we like them. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5842.1s)]
*  It just shows you. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5843.1s)]
*  When you can get every story, 100 percent of the stories, no matter what you do that's [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5844.1s)]
*  good, they make it as bad as possible. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5848.1s)]
*  And then you win in a landslide. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5851.1s)]
*  There's something, there's something wrong. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5852.1s)]
*  But the fake news hit me with eggs. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5855.1s)]
*  Remember the first week? [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5856.1s)]
*  Four days. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5858.1s)]
*  Eggs are through the roof. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5859.1s)]
*  I said, I just got here. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5860.1s)]
*  What's going on with eggs? [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5861.1s)]
*  Tell me. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5862.1s)]
*  I didn't hear about it. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5863.1s)]
*  They're up five times higher than they should be. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5864.1s)]
*  They were going through the roof, but they were blaming me. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5867.1s)]
*  I said, I just got here. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5870.1s)]
*  And within two months, our great secretary of agriculture, who I think is with us tonight, [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5872.1s)]
*  Brooke, where is Brooke? [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5878.1s)]
*  Oh, look at you. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5879.1s)]
*  Look, she is here. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5880.1s)]
*  She flew all the way from, she comes from Texas, but I think she likes Iowa maybe even [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5882.1s)]
*  better. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5887.1s)]
*  Look at her. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5888.1s)]
*  You did a good job with groceries and with eggs. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5889.1s)]
*  And we'll tell you, it's true. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5891.1s)]
*  They said, we have them this time. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5893.1s)]
*  Finally, it took an egg to get me, but that didn't happen either. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5895.1s)]
*  Now they're down to a normal price and people are ordering like crazy. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5898.1s)]
*  But inflation is dead. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5902.1s)]
*  401Ks and retirement accounts just hit an all time record high. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5904.1s)]
*  Did I hear what I think I heard? [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5913.1s)]
*  But we've achieved the lowest level of illegal border crossings in U.S. history. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5918.1s)]
*  Zero illegal. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5922.1s)]
*  Think of it. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5923.1s)]
*  Yes, it's the Mark Levin show. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5924.1s)]
*  We're enjoying the present. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5925.1s)]
*  Go ahead. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5926.1s)]
*  And as I said, I'll say it again. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5927.1s)]
*  I love it because I have never seen any country suffer. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5928.1s)]
*  No country has ever. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5931.1s)]
*  There's never, don't worry. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5932.1s)]
*  It's only fireworks. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5933.1s)]
*  I hope. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5934.1s)]
*  Famous last words. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5935.1s)]
*  My famous last words. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5936.1s)]
*  Trump said, don't worry. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5938.1s)]
*  It's only fireworks. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5939.1s)]
*  Jeez. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5941.1s)]
*  You always have to think positive. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5942.1s)]
*  I didn't like that sound either. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5945.1s)]
*  But last month, American born workers gained eight hundred and thirty thousand new jobs. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5948.1s)]
*  A record that's American. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5955.1s)]
*  Well, the illegal aliens lost three hundred and forty thousand. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5960.1s)]
*  And we don't want bad for them. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5964.1s)]
*  But look, we have a country to run and we want to have them come in and we want to have them help our farmers. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5966.1s)]
*  You know, you probably saw I got myself into a little trouble because I said, I don't want to take people away from the farmers. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5971.1s)]
*  And we're going to do something. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5976.1s)]
*  I think that's going to be good because we want all the criminals out. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5977.1s)]
*  Everybody agrees that we're finding the criminals, the murderers, the drug deals. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5981.1s)]
*  We're getting them the hell out of here. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5985.1s)]
*  But the farmers, some of the farmers, many of you sitting right here, I have four friends right in the fifth row. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5986.1s)]
*  But some of the farmers, you know, they've had people working for them for years and we're going to do something. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5992.1s)]
*  We're working with Christie and we're going to do something that we're going to sort of put the farmers in charge. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=5998.1s)]
*  And if somebody of a part, if a farmer has been with one of these people that work so hard, they bend over all day. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6005.1s)]
*  We don't have too many people can do that, but they work very hard and they know very well. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6013.1s)]
*  And some of the farmers are literally, you know, they cry when they see this happen. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6018.1s)]
*  If a farmer is willing to vouch for these people in some way, Christie, I think we're going to have to just say that's going to be good. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6023.1s)]
*  You know, we're going to be we're going to be good with it because we don't want to do it. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6029.1s)]
*  We want to do it where we take all of the workers off the farms. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6033.1s)]
*  We want the farms to do great like they're doing right now. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6037.1s)]
*  So Christie Norma has done a fantastic job and Tom Holman and we're working on legislation right now. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6040.1s)]
*  Suzy, right? We're working on legislation right now where farmers look, they know better. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6049.1s)]
*  They work with them for years. You had cases that were not here, but just even over the years where people have worked for a farm on a farm for 14, 15 years. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6055.1s)]
*  And they get thrown out pretty viciously and we can't do it. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6062.1s)]
*  We got to work with the farmers and and people that have hotels and leisure properties to we're going to work with them. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6066.1s)]
*  And we're going to work very strong and smart and we're going to put you in charge. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6072.1s)]
*  We're going to make you responsible. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6076.1s)]
*  And I think that that's going to make a lot of people happy now. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6078.1s)]
*  Serious radical, right? [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6081.1s)]
*  People who I also happen to like a lot, they may not be quite as happy, but they'll understand what they do. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6082.1s)]
*  You think so? Madam Secretary, look at you with a white hat on. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6089.1s)]
*  Do you think they'll understand that you're the one that brought this whole situation up? [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6093.1s)]
*  Brooke Rollins brought it up and she said, so we have a little problem. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6097.1s)]
*  The farmers are losing a lot of people and we figured it out and we have some great stuff being written and let the farmers be responsible. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6101.1s)]
*  And then if the farmers don't do a good job, we'll throw them the hell out of the country. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6109.1s)]
*  We'll let the guys we'll let the illegal stay and we'll throw the farmer the hell out. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6113.1s)]
*  OK, get get ready. Farmer. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6117.1s)]
*  I'm in a good mood. But violent. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6119.1s)]
*  Now, OK, so the fake news will write that Donald Trump will throw farmers out of our country. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6121.1s)]
*  They will write it because whenever I'm sarcastic, you know, when you you can't be sarcastic as a politician. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6130.1s)]
*  Well, if you're me, you can't be of yourself. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6136.1s)]
*  So I want to say I was only kidding. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6139.1s)]
*  No, no, the fake news were right. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6142.1s)]
*  And Donald Trump wants all farmers thrown the hell out of our country. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6144.1s)]
*  The audience booed the hell out of him. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6148.1s)]
*  There was no boo. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6150.1s)]
*  Now, the fake news, that's why nobody watches them anymore. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6152.1s)]
*  Violent crime is plummeting and we're on track to reach the lowest murder rate ever recorded by the year. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6155.1s)]
*  I have to admit, folks, I don't want to go away. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6161.1s)]
*  But I'm going to have to. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6163.1s)]
*  We take a break now, Mr. Producer. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6165.1s)]
*  That's knowing that we have a lot of people in the country that we didn't have in the country four or five years ago. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6168.1s)]
*  I mean, we have a lot of people that they allowed into the country that are serious criminals. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6174.1s)]
*  A lot of them are on their way out. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6178.1s)]
*  However, Iran's nuclear enrichment has been obliterated. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6180.1s)]
*  Remember when CNN said it wasn't obliterated. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6184.1s)]
*  It was maybe damaged or damaged badly, but obliterated is too strong a word. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6188.1s)]
*  No, it was obliterated. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6193.1s)]
*  That's now been proven. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6195.1s)]
*  The Atomic Energy Commission's everything that's been obliterated. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6196.1s)]
*  And they were trying to demean me by saying that. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6201.1s)]
*  But they were really demeaning those great pilots and people and mechanics that got those planes over there and were able to shoot from high up in the air going very, very fast with potentially a lot of things being shot at them and hit every single one. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6204.1s)]
*  Every single. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6221.1s)]
*  They were trying to demean me, but to me they were demeaning them and they got out of the plane and they said, What the hell we we hit every single target. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6222.1s)]
*  They know better than anybody. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6231.1s)]
*  But now that's been proven to CNN fake news and scammers that work for them, scam writers that work for them. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6233.1s)]
*  But we understand it and we fight it back. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6239.1s)]
*  And a lot of people said, Sure, don't don't criticize it because they're beneath you. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6242.1s)]
*  No, they're not beneath me. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6246.1s)]
*  Nobody's been. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6247.1s)]
*  You got to put it. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6248.1s)]
*  Otherwise, people don't understand. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6249.1s)]
*  If you don't say something about it, you got to say it. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6250.1s)]
*  These people did one of the greatest military hits and maneuvers in the history of our country. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6253.1s)]
*  And I want them to be appreciated for. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6260.1s)]
*  So they're coming. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6265.1s)]
*  They're coming to the White House tomorrow night. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6266.1s)]
*  And I'm signing the bill with the Speaker of the House. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6269.1s)]
*  And by the way, Mike Johnson did a great job. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6272.1s)]
*  John Thune did a great job. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6276.1s)]
*  I want to say a big thank you to everybody. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6278.1s)]
*  This was this whole two weeks has been incredible, hasn't it? [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6281.1s)]
*  You know, when you think of all of the victories, we stopped five nations from going to war and somebody else will get the Nobel Peace Prize for their writing about Donald Trump. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6284.1s)]
*  A professor at some school that you've never heard of has received a Nobel Prize for his writing about Donald Trump and what Donald Trump did. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6295.1s)]
*  I say, what about me? [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6304.1s)]
*  I don't get it. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6305.1s)]
*  We stopped. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6306.1s)]
*  We stopped India and Pakistan. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6307.1s)]
*  We stopped Kosovo and Serbia. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6310.1s)]
*  They've been fighting for a long time. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6313.1s)]
*  And a lot of it was trade. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6315.1s)]
*  I said, you're not going to trade with us if you're going to go to war. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6316.1s)]
*  And India, Pakistan was big, very big for a different reason. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6319.1s)]
*  I mean, they have little things called nuclear weapons. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6323.1s)]
*  You would have had pretty soon a nuclear war. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6325.1s)]
*  We stopped that in Africa. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6328.1s)]
*  You look at what was going on in the Congo with Rwanda. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6331.1s)]
*  That war was going on for 30 years, 30 years, and we stopped it and it was vicious. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6335.1s)]
*  Six million people killed and it was a bad one. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6342.1s)]
*  It was killed and killed badly. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6347.1s)]
*  Machetes, you know what a machete is? [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6350.1s)]
*  You don't want to know. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6352.1s)]
*  And we just did a really great job. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6354.1s)]
*  And then, of course, you cap it off with the hit, the perfect hit in Iran where they were talking awfully badly. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6356.1s)]
*  You know, death to America, death to Israel. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6362.1s)]
*  They were talking awfully badly and they're not talking badly anymore, to be honest with you. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6364.1s)]
*  And we might even meet with them and see if they want to meet. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6369.1s)]
*  They want to meet and we'll see if we can do something. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6372.1s)]
*  But they want to meet. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6375.1s)]
*  I think they want to be very badly. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6376.1s)]
*  But our allies have agreed to pay over a trillion dollars a year for our defense. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6378.1s)]
*  You saw what happened in NATO. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6384.1s)]
*  We're going to take a little break now. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6385.1s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6387.1s)]
*  All right. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6394.1s)]
*  We're winding up our week because I won't be here tomorrow. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6395.1s)]
*  I hear it's July 4th. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6399.1s)]
*  We love our July 4th Independence Day around here. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6401.1s)]
*  We spent a lot of time on radio and TV talking about these things. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6403.1s)]
*  And I want the veterans and our active duty military, all of our volunteers to know how much we regard them and respect them here. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6408.1s)]
*  We don't even need July 4th or any other day to remind us we do it every day because we believe in it. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6418.1s)]
*  I want to thank you all in the audience too for being so loyal and so wonderful and so interested in so much. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6424.1s)]
*  Some people just hang it up. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6434.1s)]
*  You're not that. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6436.1s)]
*  And it is a great honor. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6438.1s)]
*  And I want to thank you for your loyalty. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6439.1s)]
*  I'm very grateful for your support. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6441.1s)]
*  I know it and I appreciate it. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6443.1s)]
*  Classy people, smart people, respectful people, people who love their country, people who work hard or in retirement or trying to enjoy themselves after working all their lives. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6446.1s)]
*  That's you. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6457.1s)]
*  And it is a great honor. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miw7cHjdxLE&t=6459.1s)]
