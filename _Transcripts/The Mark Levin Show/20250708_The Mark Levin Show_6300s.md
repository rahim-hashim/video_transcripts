Video Description: On Tuesday’s Mark Levin Show, the Texas flood has caused immense heartbreak, with over 100 dead and more than 160 missing. Among the tragic stories are two young sisters, aged 13 and 11, found drowned but holding hands. Mother Nature can be a monster. Also, President Trump has had enough of Putin. Putin is a genocidal maniac responsible for slaughtering Ukrainian civilians, but there are some in Fake MAGA who root for Russia. Trump has stated bluntly that he won’t tolerate Putin’s actions any longer. Later, there’s been a lot of buzz about Jeffrey Epstein and an alleged "list" of people tied to his crimes, but it’s all speculation. The FBI has investigated, but no major new revelations have been confirmed. Social media keeps the topic alive with conspiracy theories. In addition, the Supreme Court, in an 8-1 decision, upheld Trump’s plan to reduce the federal workforce, overturning a Ninth Circuit ruling. The order affirmed the president’s authority to manage the executive branch without congressional approval, citing separation of powers.  Afterward, the welfare state's growth, seen as new constitutional rights, obscures increasing control and regulation, failing to deliver promised equity. This strengthens the ruling class, diminishes individual and societal rights, and erodes compromise, unlike the Founders’ positive power approach, which supports liberty and peaceful resolution.

# Politics Amidst Tragedy: Heroes and Hypocrisy in Texas
**The Mark Levin Show:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q)
*  The radical left's agendas are attacking your American values, but conservatives like you haven't forgotten what this country was built on. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=0.0s)]
*  My friends, the Heritage Foundation exists to make sure your voice is heard and to represent your values in the swamp and quagmire of D.C. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=7.0s)]
*  The Heritage Foundation stands for your values and will not give up the fight because they know you never will. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=15.0s)]
*  Paid for by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=22.0s)]
*  He's here. He's here. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=24.0s)]
*  Now, broadcasting from the underground command post, deep in the bowels of a hidden bunker, somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building, we once again make contact with our leader, Mark LeVein. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=27.0s)]
*  Hello America, Mark LeVein here, our number 877-381-3811. 877-381-3811. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=114.0s)]
*  You know, the stories you hear about this Texas flood, they're just heartbreaking. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=129.0s)]
*  The 13 and 11 year old sisters, did you hear Mr. Producer? They found them holding hands. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=137.0s)]
*  They were dead. They had drowned, but they were holding each other's hands. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=145.0s)]
*  That's just, uh, that's enough to make the toughest man cry, I think. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=151.0s)]
*  Over a hundred dead now. Some 40 or more missing. Still looking, actually more than that, 160 and some missing. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=159.0s)]
*  All the politicians in the media, they have all the answers. What about sirens? What about this? What about that? I don't know. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=169.0s)]
*  These natural disasters, it's hard to prepare for them, it's hard to know what to do. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=181.0s)]
*  Even in the best of circumstances and the sense of preparation. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=187.0s)]
*  Maybe there are ways to ameliorate situations, but there's no way to end this. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=195.0s)]
*  The earth is the earth, and the earth can be a very angry place. It absolutely can. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=204.0s)]
*  All these little kids, and don't get me wrong, these adults too, and these counselors who are quite young. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=213.0s)]
*  It's just so sad. So terrible. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=221.0s)]
*  And all the people who are helping, all the great heroes down there, you've got people pouring out of communities [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=228.0s)]
*  throughout the state of Texas, throughout the country, heading down there, doing everything they can, what they feel they can do. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=237.0s)]
*  And then you look again at the individuals in and around Washington, D.C., and I don't mean the citizenry, I mean the power. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=248.0s)]
*  Those in power. Some of them are breaking their ass to get as many resources down there as they can. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=257.0s)]
*  Others are just looking for opportunities to exploit. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=263.0s)]
*  It always amazes me when the left, the media, when they talk about the failures of government, yet they want more and more of it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=267.0s)]
*  They talk about the failures of government, yet they want more and more of it. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=277.0s)]
*  And when you had Doge that showed all this bloat and all this waste and fraud, including in FEMA, they had no problem with it. None. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=284.0s)]
*  As if making these agencies bigger will fix something. It won't. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=293.0s)]
*  They started with a National Weather Service. I noticed today we're not talking about the National Weather Service, are we, Mr. Producer? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=299.0s)]
*  Because people lied about it. They said it was understaffed, and it turned out the head of the union and others pointed out that actually they [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=305.0s)]
*  were not understaffed, that they had more staff than usual. They were paying overtime for people to come in. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=313.0s)]
*  And I'm watching these press conferences with these searches. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=323.0s)]
*  And what you think about what they're facing, not only facing danger, certainly were early on, but they are the ones who are finding these bodies. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=330.0s)]
*  Imagine the impact, the psychological and emotional impact that has on a person. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=340.0s)]
*  Especially if it's a little kid. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=347.0s)]
*  Just imagine the impact. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=351.0s)]
*  Finding a couple of kids together, lifeless. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=356.0s)]
*  It's got to be unbelievable. It's got to be horrific. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=362.0s)]
*  So I want to point that out. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=369.0s)]
*  There's something we can do to help them. In the aftermath, these families and these communities, there's nothing we can do [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=374.0s)]
*  to stop something that already occurred. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=381.0s)]
*  Better minds than mine will figure out if there are ways to ameliorate situations like this, but there's certainly no way to stop them. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=385.0s)]
*  It's unfortunate, but it's true. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=393.0s)]
*  That's the nature of Mother Nature. I hate that phrase because it makes it sound like nature is so loving. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=396.0s)]
*  We hear about polar bears and all the rest, but nature can be a real monster. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=401.0s)]
*  A real monster. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=407.0s)]
*  Looks like President Trump's had about enough of Vladimir Putin, who's slaughtering Ukrainian civilians left and right now. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=413.0s)]
*  I don't understand, even if you disagree with our posture there, I don't understand that. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=425.0s)]
*  But even if you do, I don't understand this visceral hate for Zelensky. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=433.0s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=440.0s)]
*  He's fighting like hell for his country. He wants as much weaponry as he can possibly get, wherever he can get it, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=443.0s)]
*  whether it's the United States or Europe or anybody else for that matter. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=449.0s)]
*  Isn't that what he's supposed to do? Isn't that what we want our president to do? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=452.0s)]
*  It's a very small country of 40-some million people, up against Russia, 160 million people, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=457.0s)]
*  heavily outarmed, heavily outmanned, and they've put up a hell of a fight. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=464.0s)]
*  We used to root for an underdog, particularly when the underdog was democratic as opposed to communist. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=472.0s)]
*  But we have some individuals now in our country who root for the communists, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=478.0s)]
*  in this case the old KGB mass-murdering genocidal maniac, against Ukraine. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=483.0s)]
*  And most of these same people root for Iran against Israel. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=491.0s)]
*  Think about it. Think about how perverse this is. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=496.0s)]
*  I support Israel and I support Ukraine, and I'll support Taiwan if Taiwan gets attacked. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=502.0s)]
*  I think that's the position of red-blooded Americans, whatever we call ourselves otherwise, that's what we are, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=509.0s)]
*  red-blooded Americans. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=515.0s)]
*  And you watch. You watch as these fake maggot types, more like maggot types, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=518.0s)]
*  some of whom are America haters dressed up as America lovers, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=526.0s)]
*  some of whom are Jew haters who give their platforms to anti-Semites, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=532.0s)]
*  some of whom are much more sympathetic to the Third Reich and they trash Churchill. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=538.0s)]
*  These are sick people. These are truly sick people. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=542.0s)]
*  President Trump had a remarkable cabinet meeting today. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=547.0s)]
*  I watched almost all of it, including talking about how he's redesigned some of the rooms, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=551.0s)]
*  some of the portraits he's brought in, some of the antiquities and so forth. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=559.0s)]
*  He loves this stuff because, look, he was a builder. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=563.0s)]
*  When you look at Mar-a-Lago, that is a magnificent structure with magnificent interior and so forth. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=566.0s)]
*  He's got great taste, great taste. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=572.0s)]
*  And with everything he's doing, he's doing that too. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=577.0s)]
*  It's incredible. He's an incredible person. He just is. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=580.0s)]
*  Now, we're going to get to this in a minute, but there's a lot of hyperreaction on the Internet, of course. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=583.0s)]
*  That's where most of the hyperreaction goes on, not on talk radio, not on the internet. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=593.0s)]
*  And people, many of whom you know, trashing the President of the United States over the issue of amnesty, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=599.0s)]
*  amnesty for farm workers. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=608.0s)]
*  And both he and his Secretary of Agriculture said, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=612.0s)]
*  we're not going to give amnesty to farm workers. You're going to hear that in a moment too. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=617.0s)]
*  So there's no amnesty for farm workers. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=621.0s)]
*  I told you what I think about this Epstein thing yesterday. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=623.0s)]
*  You've got people with platforms. They have to have hits. They have to have subscribers. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=626.0s)]
*  They have to constantly be hyper emotional. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=635.0s)]
*  And you see that in the news. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=642.0s)]
*  They have to constantly be hyper emotional. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=645.0s)]
*  And you see this as they try and draw attention to themselves. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=652.0s)]
*  It's the same for some of the media that reports on what they say and do, like MediaEye or The Drudge Report or others. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=657.0s)]
*  They've got to create an audience. They've got to create a viewership, if you will. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=664.0s)]
*  And this is how they do it. They're all national inquiring worse, worse. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=673.0s)]
*  There's nothing intelligent that has ever said on The Drudge Report or MediaEye or places like that. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=682.0s)]
*  Nothing. There's nothing intelligent said on some of these podcasts. Nothing. Zero. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=687.0s)]
*  There's conspiracy theories, there's collusion arguments, there's this, that. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=694.0s)]
*  One of the morons today said in the Epstein matter, he believes that the US intelligence and the Israeli intelligence have covered up the Epstein matter, Mr. Producer. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=699.0s)]
*  Now, why would the US intelligence and Israeli intelligence cover up the Epstein matter? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=710.0s)]
*  Can you think of anything, Rich? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=717.0s)]
*  I can't. That's a conspiracy theory without a conspiracy. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=720.0s)]
*  It's bizarre. So Ratcliffe over at the CIA and the Mossad that's busy fighting a war, they're very worried about the Epstein matter blowing up, so they're covering it up. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=726.0s)]
*  No, they're not. How stupid is that? But that's thrown out there to get eyes, to get ears. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=735.0s)]
*  That didn't make any sense. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=743.0s)]
*  Then I'm supposed to believe, as I said last night, that there's this huge conspiracy, including a conspiracy with many of our friends, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=746.0s)]
*  who we trusted before they went in the administration, but now we're not supposed to trust them. Cash Patel, who's a great patriot. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=753.0s)]
*  Dan Bongino, a great patriot, a man who's put his life on the line as a cop in the Secret Service, who's been in this business right here. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=761.0s)]
*  I love the guy, he's a dear friend. I haven't discussed Epstein with him. Why would I? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=771.0s)]
*  We're supposed to believe he and Patel and Pam Bondi, who was one of the great litigators in 2020, trying to defend the president in the election, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=777.0s)]
*  that all three of them and scores of others have thrown in the conspire to hide whatever it is that's in the Epstein material that's supposedly out there. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=788.0s)]
*  You want to go there? Go there. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=799.0s)]
*  When I go down my street here and talk to people, when I go to the diners that I like to go to, the supermarkets I like to go to, and people come up to me, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=805.0s)]
*  if I bring up Epstein, nine out of ten won't even know what the hell I'm talking about, Rich. They just won't know. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=813.0s)]
*  They want to know about war and peace. They want to know about prices. They want to know about the border and immigration. They want to know about real big stuff. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=820.0s)]
*  Now, if there's some Epstein list of people who were molesting underage girls, why would they hide it? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=828.0s)]
*  So we're to believe that the Biden administration hid it, and the Trump administration hid it. Now, why would the Biden administration hide it? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=841.0s)]
*  Then you have these sleazeballs that say, well, maybe Trump is on the list. Well, why wouldn't the Biden administration release that? Because he's not on any list. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=853.0s)]
*  And so this is the world of the Internet. This is the world of these buffoons who try and exploit you, who try to expose these things. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=861.0s)]
*  Some of you, if you're disappointed, I'm sorry you're disappointed. I don't know what to do for you. I can sit here and rail on and on about it. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=871.0s)]
*  I can go on and on and speculate. Maybe the Mossad was involved and Ratcliffe and the CIA was involved and Patel and Bongino and Bondi. They all got together to cover it up. Why? Why? Why? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=881.0s)]
*  Or maybe the guy killed himself. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=900.0s)]
*  Isn't that possible? [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=906.0s)]
*  Now, in this little cabal, this is a big issue. This is the issue of the day. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=909.0s)]
*  This is it, baby. But in the rest of the country, it's not. Now, we should have learned from this a week, 10 days ago, two weeks ago, when many of the same cabalists, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=920.0s)]
*  when the same hemorrhagics, aka human hemorrhoids, when the same people were going on and on about how the American people and the supporters of Trump don't want Israel taking on the Iranian regime and certainly don't want the United States bombing those [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=932.0s)]
*  nuclear sites. But they were only off by 94% when 94% of Republican MAGA supported it. 90% at first and then 94% after it was successful. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=953.0s)]
*  So, I mean, this is the reality. This is the reality. I'll be right back. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=969.0s)]
*  Folks, the American flag is under attack. We saw it mocked and burned in LA during protests. And when people attack the American flag, aren't they attacking everything it stands for? The sacrifice of our troops, the values of our founding, the promise of liberty and justice for all. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=983.0s)]
*  Thankfully, patriots like you haven't forgotten what the flag stands for. You're the reason the Heritage Foundation created Flags of Our Fathers, the meaning and history of the U.S. flag. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=997.0s)]
*  This is a resource for patriots like you to remind and refresh ourselves of the American flag's history and deep importance to our nation. Claim your free copy today at heritage.org slash levin. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1007.0s)]
*  That's heritage.org slash L E V I N. If we lose the meaning of our flag, we risk losing our nation. That's why it's imperative that patriots just like you take advantage of the Heritage Foundation's new resource, Flags of Our Fathers. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1018.0s)]
*  Let's do our part in this fight by going to heritage.org slash levin right now. Heritage.org slash L E V I N. Paid for by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1032.0s)]
*  Just being real, just being real, some present at the cabinet meeting today about Putin and Russia. Cut one, Mr. Producer, go. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1042.0s)]
*  Just returning back to Russia, if there's anything that you would signal about your displeasure with them? [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1058.0s)]
*  Well, I'm just, look, I'm very unhappy with them. There's no reason for this. It's turned out to be tougher, but it's only tougher. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1065.0s)]
*  And I will say the Ukrainians were brave, but we gave them the best equipment ever made. We gave them the anti-tank busters that knocked out tanks. I mean, you just aim them in the direction of the tank and the tank is gone. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1075.0s)]
*  We gave them missiles, the latest and the greatest. They were able to shoot down a lot of things that would have normally wiped out, you know, probably would have been a very quick war. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1091.0s)]
*  It would have been a war that lasted three, four days, but they had the benefit of unbelievable equipment. And Europe gave them to them. We gave them far more because Biden shouldn't have done that. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1103.0s)]
*  He should have equalized. We should have given them the same or we should have given actually less than Europe. It affects Europe much more than us. But we're in there for over $300 million. Europe's in there for over $100 million. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1113.0s)]
*  But still, Europe gave a lot. And I will say this, the Ukrainians, whether you think it's unfair that we gave all that money or not, they were very brave because somebody had to operate that stuff. And a lot of people I know wouldn't be operating it. They wouldn't have the courage to do it. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1125.0s)]
*  So there you go. There's more about this. And we'll discuss it. We'll be right back. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1141.0s)]
*  Folks, we've seen in our streets over the past several months, the burning of the American flag. Even worse, we saw the Mexican flag and the Palestinian flag wave defiantly during L.A.'s violent riots. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1151.0s)]
*  There's something seriously wrong with that picture. The American flag is under attack across the country and with it the American promise of liberty. But while the left attacks our flag and everything else we hold dear, bold conservatives like you across the country refuse to let the flag fall. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1161.0s)]
*  That's why the Heritage Foundation created Flags of Our Fathers, a critical resource for patriots who want to remind ourselves of the American flag's history. Flags of Our Fathers contains the untold history of the flag's creation and the meaning of the stars and stripes. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1177.0s)]
*  Let's take a stand for the American flag today by going to heritage.org slash Levin, heritage.org slash L-E-V-I-N and claiming your free copy of Flags of Our Fathers. That's heritage.org slash L-E-V-I-N paid for by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1191.0s)]
*  There they go again. The radical left wing media is colluding with a handful of boneheads who claim to represent MAGA. Now let's do this again. There's 77 million people who voted for President Trump. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1207.0s)]
*  We all feel like we're MAGA, don't we? Make America great again? So these people who embrace Iran, these people who would have left Iran with nuclear weapons, these people who coddle up to Putin and have no problem with them firing missiles into Kiev and these other places, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1230.0s)]
*  I mean, folks, do they represent you? But the media want them to represent you and they want to use them to try and create a pseudo rift because it's not real between us and the United States. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1245.0s)]
*  I think we think the president's doing an unbelievable job, a fantastic job in foreign policy and domestic policy. On everything he'd say he'd address, in flagellation, in the United States, he's doing an incredible job. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1260.0s)]
*  He's doing all the things he said he would do. He's doing all the things he said he would do. He's doing all the things he said he would do. He's doing all the things he said he would do. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1275.0s)]
*  He's doing all the things he said he would do. He's doing all the things he said he would do. He's doing all the things he said he would do. He's doing all the things he said he would do. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1290.0s)]
*  So he's not out of step. He's keeping his promises. He's delivering on his promises. Honestly, like no president I've ever seen in my lifetime, probably you too, right? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1305.0s)]
*  And so we have these people who live and make a fortune off of how many people they can get angry, excite, fear monger, scare monger, and draw attention to themselves. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1316.0s)]
*  And so the left-wing media and their entrails, these websites, are more than happy to accommodate because that's how these guys make their money. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1329.0s)]
*  And they want you to believe that the president is defying MAGA. The president is MAGA. You're MAGA. These people have never stood for election. They don't represent anybody but their own big mouths. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1338.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1353.0s)]
*  The president, let me repeat, the president is not an isolationist. He never has been. The president is not an appeaser. He's never been an appeaser. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1358.0s)]
*  The president is not a pacifist. He's never been a pacifist. Conversely, the president is not an interventionist. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1368.0s)]
*  The president is not an interventionist. As McCain was at one point and Rubio, as a matter of fact, was at one point and some of the others were. He's never been there either. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1376.0s)]
*  He brings common sense, that is prudence, to his decisions. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1390.0s)]
*  He's never hidden this. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1396.0s)]
*  He's never denied it. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1399.0s)]
*  NATO is stronger. Not because of the Bushes, not because of Obama, not because of Biden, not because of Trump. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1401.0s)]
*  Trump threatening to withdraw from NATO. Now they're all kicking in 5% except for Spain and he'll deal with Spain. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1410.0s)]
*  So NATO is stronger and will be stronger than it's ever been. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1418.0s)]
*  Because NATO is important. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1425.0s)]
*  Again, despite what these boneheads have said. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1428.0s)]
*  These people are so crazy ass, that of course they come full circle with Bernie Sanders and AOC and Tlaib and Omar. That's not you. That's not me. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1435.0s)]
*  We don't want the Iranians to have nuclear weapons. The president followed through and eliminated it. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1451.0s)]
*  Perfect. No World War III, no regional wars. As a matter of fact, peace is breaking out now. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1456.0s)]
*  Peace is breaking out. The United States and Israel are now the center of power in that region of the world. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1461.0s)]
*  And these countries want peace. They want an alliance with us and the state of Israel. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1470.0s)]
*  Not all of them, but some of them you can never do it with. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1475.0s)]
*  It wouldn't have been possible but for Netanyahu and Donald Trump. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1480.0s)]
*  Trump was attacked. Netanyahu is constantly attacked. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1484.0s)]
*  We look at Europe. NATO is stronger than ever. Stronger than ever. Why? Because Donald Trump threatened a withdrawal. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1489.0s)]
*  And he forced them to kick in 5% of their GDP. That's a lot of money. That's a trillion dollars. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1496.0s)]
*  And that's a good thing. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1505.0s)]
*  He put a lot of pressure on Putin, a lot of pressure on Zelensky. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1510.0s)]
*  Zelensky's come around, apparently. He wants a deal, apparently. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1514.0s)]
*  They made their natural resources, very important to us, now available to us, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1523.0s)]
*  which we can mine and use, these rare earth minerals, so we don't have to rely on communist China or Central Africa and so forth. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1528.0s)]
*  These are all good things. And now he's saying, you know what, I'm going to give some [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1537.0s)]
*  patriot missiles, defensive missiles to Ukraine. Obviously, Europe can give them some offensive weaponry. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1545.0s)]
*  He can also give them some offensive weaponry, too, so they can sustain themselves and survive. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1552.0s)]
*  Now, what's interesting about this, Mr. Producer, in many ways, have these not been my positions from day one? [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1560.0s)]
*  Not because I'm Nostradamus. Not because I'm prescient. Because I use common sense, experience. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1570.0s)]
*  Each situation has to be dealt with differently. Each one. It's not about a new foreign policy or an old foreign policy. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1580.0s)]
*  It's about a rational foreign policy. One which puts America first. What is in our best interest? [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1589.0s)]
*  To see Iran with nukes and intercontinental ballistic missiles? [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1596.0s)]
*  To see Taiwan gobbled up by communist China, which also wants chunks out of Japan and the Philippines and Australia? [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1600.0s)]
*  That's okay. Of course, it's not okay. It's crazy. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1608.0s)]
*  Russia wants to cut through Ukraine. And what's to the west of Ukraine? Anybody know? [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1612.0s)]
*  It's a country, you may have heard of it. It's called Poland. Poland knows it. Poland's thrown as many weapons as it can possibly husband into Ukraine. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1617.0s)]
*  Are they stupid? No, they're right there. They know what the hell's going on. So do the Baltic states. So does Romania. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1627.0s)]
*  They all know. Because they've read what Putin has said. No phony interviews. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1635.0s)]
*  Now, ladies and gentlemen, we're not warmongers. We're not neocons. We're red-blooded Americans. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1644.0s)]
*  We're not imperialists. We're not colonialists. You know, it's amazing to me how these morons sound as much like this idiot running for mayor of New York as not. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1654.0s)]
*  It's amazing how the Marxist Islamists have come full around to the isolationist fascists. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1666.0s)]
*  Because more and more, they sound like fascists to me. I'm just saying they sound more and more like fascists to me. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1672.0s)]
*  They're dabbling in Holocaust denial and bringing one individual after another, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1681.0s)]
*  platforming individuals who are absolute flat-out Jew haters for no damn reason, rewriting World War II and the history of the Third Reich and Churchill. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1688.0s)]
*  I mean, how much more of this crap do you want to put up with? It's so insane. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1698.0s)]
*  And of course, the Drudge reports, the media, of course they all give this attention, push it because it's a big deal. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1704.0s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1714.0s)]
*  Plus, they can say this is MAGA. It's not MAGA. That's crazy. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1719.0s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1725.0s)]
*  If I'm the last man standing here, maybe I am in this genre with these platforms. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1730.0s)]
*  Is willing to call them as I see them. Is willing to call out the grifters. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1739.0s)]
*  Willing to call out the lunatics. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1745.0s)]
*  Whether they be the Marxist Islamists or the isolationists, then so be it. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1750.0s)]
*  Then so be it. I can live with myself. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1758.0s)]
*  If this is the last broadcast I ever give, that's okay, so be it. I can live with myself. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1765.0s)]
*  President Trump, more on this Putin stuff. Cut to go. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1774.0s)]
*  But that was a war that should have never happened and a lot of people are dying and it should end. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1783.0s)]
*  And I don't know, we get a lot of bullsh** thrown at us by Putin for you want to know the truth. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1790.0s)]
*  It's very nice all the time, but it turns out to be meaningless. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1797.0s)]
*  Do you want to say something? [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1802.0s)]
*  Do you want to say something? [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1803.0s)]
*  Do you want to say something? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1804.0s)]
*  Do you want to say something? [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1805.0s)]
*  Do you want to say something? [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1806.0s)]
*  I'm looking at it, yeah. I'm looking. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1807.0s)]
*  The Senate is passing and passed a very tough sanction. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1808.0s)]
*  But yeah, I'm looking at it. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1812.0s)]
*  Can you sign that? [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1813.0s)]
*  It's an optional bill. It's totally at my option. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1814.0s)]
*  I'm looking at it very strongly. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1817.0s)]
*  What he's trying to say there is he wants to leverage it and put pressure on Putin. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1823.0s)]
*  It's rational, logical. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1827.0s)]
*  And so this story, the historical story of the press that hates your guts, that defended Biden, that defended Hunter Biden, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1829.0s)]
*  the 51 phony security individuals and on and on and on, they keep promoting, promoting, promoting the fake MAGA, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1835.0s)]
*  promoting the isolation, as he keep promoting these people who sound more and more like socialists to me, by the way. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1844.0s)]
*  They keep promoting them and giving them headlines and talking about them and how they've turned on Trump. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1852.0s)]
*  I haven't turned on Trump of you, Mr. Producer. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1857.0s)]
*  I want you folks to think about the tens of millions of you out there. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1860.0s)]
*  Have you turned on Trump? [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1864.0s)]
*  Who do they think they represent? [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1865.0s)]
*  These media outlets, who do they think they're talking to? [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1867.0s)]
*  A few jerks with a platform? [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1872.0s)]
*  The hell do they think they're talking for and to? [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1876.0s)]
*  I couldn't be more happy with this man and the things he's doing for this country. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1882.0s)]
*  But look how they stab him in the back. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1889.0s)]
*  Look how they turn on him. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1891.0s)]
*  And they want you to think he's abandoned MAGA. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1894.0s)]
*  He's abandoned MAGA. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1897.0s)]
*  How can you abandon MAGA when you invented it? [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1898.0s)]
*  How can you abandon MAGA when you are MAGA? [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1905.0s)]
*  He hasn't abandoned anything. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1911.0s)]
*  When circumstances change, he analyzes it and he makes decisions. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1915.0s)]
*  He's a very smart man. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1919.0s)]
*  You do that in your own life and he does it in his. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1921.0s)]
*  His decisions are based on strongly held beliefs and values and principles. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1924.0s)]
*  But when circumstances evolve, he doesn't abandon those beliefs, values and principles. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1929.0s)]
*  He has to adjust the manifestation of them, the implementation of them, the approach that he takes. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1934.0s)]
*  And that's what makes him brilliant. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1940.0s)]
*  These other guys, they bang their heads into the wall. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1942.0s)]
*  They bang their heads into the wall. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1945.0s)]
*  So far they claim that the fake MAGA isolationists, that we should have stood with Iran, that we should stand with Putin. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1949.0s)]
*  Is that what you think America? [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1959.0s)]
*  Is this Epstein matter the biggest matter with you and your family, you and your business, you and your job, paying your bills, keeping your neighborhoods? [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1962.0s)]
*  I'm just curious to know because it is with some of these people. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1971.0s)]
*  Is that your number one issue? [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1974.0s)]
*  You actually think one of the greatest conservatives I've ever known, my buddy Dan Bongino and his boss Cash Patel and his boss, Pam Bondi, are in a conspiracy to cover for Epstein? [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1978.0s)]
*  Is that what you think? [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1994.0s)]
*  That's what they say. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1996.0s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=1998.0s)]
*  Dan hasn't changed. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2002.0s)]
*  Cash hasn't changed. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2004.0s)]
*  Payment hasn't changed. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2005.0s)]
*  But if they don't take these positions and do it in a hysterical way, if they don't claim to represent millions and millions of people, which they don't, then they won't exist for all intents and purposes. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2008.0s)]
*  They've created their own reality. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2027.0s)]
*  They've created their own platforms. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2029.0s)]
*  They've created their own world. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2030.0s)]
*  And that's where they live. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2032.0s)]
*  And they insist that you that you join them. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2033.0s)]
*  The only way they come into your house is if you let them into your house. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2038.0s)]
*  They're not on TV or radio, right, Mr. Producer? [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2042.0s)]
*  So in order to for you to let them into your house, you have to pay them directly. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2046.0s)]
*  Some of them indirectly. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2054.0s)]
*  It's not like just turning on the radio or turning on TV. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2057.0s)]
*  They've got to grab your attention and they don't need a vast audience. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2061.0s)]
*  They just need a niche. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2067.0s)]
*  And that. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2069.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2070.0s)]
*  Oops. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2071.0s)]
*  They're all crap. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2072.0s)]
*  The guy was explaining to me yesterday how this is all BS. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2074.0s)]
*  Probably is. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2078.0s)]
*  Although the ratings in TV and radio. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2083.0s)]
*  Some of it's BS, but most of it's not. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2085.0s)]
*  I'll be right. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2092.0s)]
*  Oh, I can't go yet. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2093.0s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2094.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, I got to go. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2095.0s)]
*  I'll be right back. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2096.0s)]
*  Mark. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2097.0s)]
*  Love in. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2098.0s)]
*  Folks, the American flag is under attack. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2104.0s)]
*  We saw it mocked and burned in L.A. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2106.0s)]
*  during protests. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2108.0s)]

*  Thankfully, patriots like you haven't forgotten what the flag stands for. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2121.0s)]
*  You're the reason the Heritage Foundation created Flags of Our Fathers, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2125.0s)]

*  President Trump, one more. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2169.0s)]
*  About Putin and Ukraine today. Cut, three, go. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2174.0s)]
*  President, you guys sent more weapons to Ukraine, as you said last night. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2177.0s)]
*  Last week the Pentagon paused some shipments of weapons to Ukraine. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2180.0s)]
*  Did you approve of that pause? [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2184.0s)]
*  We want to put defensive weapons because Putin is not treating human beings right. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2186.0s)]
*  He's killing too many people. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2192.0s)]
*  So we're sending some defensive weapons to Ukraine and I've approved that. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2194.0s)]
*  So who ordered the pause last week? [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2199.0s)]
*  I don't know. What did you tell me? [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2201.0s)]
*  This is a very important question. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2203.0s)]
*  Somebody at the Pentagon, they've been saying Elbridge Jerry, Elbridge Colby, whose grandfather, by the way, was Colby at the CIA. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2207.0s)]
*  He was actually a pretty good man. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2217.0s)]
*  That it was he. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2219.0s)]
*  I think Congress really does need to get to the bottom of this because the president didn't order it. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2221.0s)]
*  I doubt Hegseth ordered it. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2225.0s)]
*  Somebody ordered the withholding of weapons from Ukraine last week, said we were running out of weapons, which we weren't. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2226.0s)]
*  He's talking about patron missile systems and so forth, among other things, weapons to stop tanks in order to help protect those people over there. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2233.0s)]

*  We've once again made contact with our leader, Mark Levin. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2276.0s)]
*  Hello America, Mark Levin here, our number 877-381-3811, 877-381-3811. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2281.0s)]
*  Well, several people have now been arrested. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2295.0s)]
*  Have now been arrested for setting up ICE agents and trying to kill one of them. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2301.0s)]
*  Here is Fox 4. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2312.0s)]
*  A Vorado ICE facility attack, 11 charged in ambush on ICE officers, officials say. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2316.0s)]
*  This is Dallas-Fort Worth. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2323.0s)]
*  Officials say 10 to 12 individuals in military-style clothing have fired fireworks to lure officers out while a gunman in the woods shot an Alvarado police officer in the neck. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2327.0s)]
*  He's expected to survive. I don't know how, but 10 suspects, mostly from North Texas, are charged with attempted murder of a federal officer with one facing obstruction of justice. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2337.0s)]
*  This was an organized attack. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2350.0s)]
*  Now we're seeing a lot of violence from the left, whether it's two people working at the Israeli embassy shot in the back, whether it is the CEO of UnitedHealthcare shot in the back, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2357.0s)]
*  whether it is this assault on ICE officers, whether it's members of Congress assaulting ICE officers. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2375.0s)]
*  The things that they're saying are horrendous. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2383.0s)]
*  They're being encouraged to be violent, in my view, by these Democrats, who then claim that, of course they're not. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2387.0s)]
*  And then they keep pointing to January 6th. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2396.0s)]
*  I'll say what I've said a thousand times. The only person who died on January 6th was an unarmed protester who was shot in cold blood through a door. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2399.0s)]
*  I don't know how many more times I have to explain that. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2412.0s)]
*  The Democrats like to count heart attacks and this, that, and the other. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2416.0s)]
*  I mean, is that what we normally do under circumstances? [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2420.0s)]
*  How many people had heart attacks in LA the other day? [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2423.0s)]
*  Here's the acting U.S. attorney, Larson. North Texas at a press conference today. Cut 7, Mr. Producer. Go. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2431.0s)]
*  We're here to tell you that late at night on July 4th, Friday night at approximately 1037 p.m. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2438.0s)]
*  At the Prairie Land ICE Detention Center in Alvarado, Texas, 10 to 12 individuals dressed in black military style clothing began shooting fireworks and engaging in acts of vandalism at the facility. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2447.0s)]
*  And this was part of an organized attack. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2463.0s)]
*  Today, my office has charged 10 individuals with three counts of attempted murder of a federal officer. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2467.0s)]
*  Each of the 10 are also charged with three counts of discharging a firearm in relation to a crime of violence. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2474.0s)]
*  Each of these defendants faces a mandatory prison term of 10 years and up to life in prison. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2481.0s)]
*  An additional co-conspirator was charged with obstruction of justice and conspiracy for attempting to conceal and destroy evidence in relation to the attack. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2488.0s)]
*  And he faces up to 10 years in prison. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2499.0s)]
*  Let's discuss the incident. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2502.0s)]
*  It was a planned ambush with the intent to kill ICE corrections officers. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2504.0s)]
*  Make no mistake. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2511.0s)]
*  This was not a so-called peaceful protest. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2512.0s)]
*  It was indeed an ambush. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2516.0s)]
*  Most of these protests are not peaceful. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2521.0s)]
*  So now ICE is the enemy, the Border Patrol is the enemy, local police departments are the enemy. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2523.0s)]
*  And the Democrat Party is, in fact, not just fanning the flames. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2529.0s)]
*  The Democrat Party, in many ways, is the collective arsonist. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2536.0s)]
*  When you listen to what these people say, they haven't come out and said, cut out the violence. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2542.0s)]
*  They haven't come out and said, cool down the rhetoric. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2548.0s)]
*  They haven't cooled down the rhetoric. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2551.0s)]
*  They haven't done a damn thing. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2553.0s)]
*  They haven't done a damn thing. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2555.0s)]
*  The Democrat Party is a violent party. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2559.0s)]
*  It's always been a violent party, even since before the Civil War, but the Civil War was the pinnacle. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2561.0s)]
*  The Democrat Party was a violent party during the Civil Rights Movement. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2566.0s)]
*  And the Democrat Party is a violent party right now. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2571.0s)]
*  Right now. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2575.0s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2577.0s)]
*  Sanctuary cities. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2579.0s)]
*  I've told you that sanctuary cities, sanctuary states, these are confederates. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2581.0s)]
*  It's the old confederacy. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2585.0s)]
*  They do not comply with the federal constitution, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2589.0s)]
*  where immigration is a plenary power under the federal government. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2594.0s)]
*  Under the federal government. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2600.0s)]
*  They say, we're not going to comply with ICE requests. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2603.0s)]
*  We're not going to comply with the federal government. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2606.0s)]
*  That's why the president says, well, we're cutting off your funding. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2608.0s)]
*  And yet we have these Democrat, radical, left-wing, rogue lawyers dressed up as judges [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2610.0s)]
*  who are in these positions for the purpose of thwarting the Constitution and the President of the United States. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2616.0s)]
*  Who are giving them safe harbor. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2624.0s)]
*  Or trying to. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2626.0s)]
*  Or trying to. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2629.0s)]
*  To advance the radical agenda. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2631.0s)]
*  So they're like judges from the Confederate period. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2633.0s)]
*  That are ruling in favor of the confederacy. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2636.0s)]
*  So the issue isn't slavery right now. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2639.0s)]
*  The issue right now is the radical revolution against the United States of America. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2641.0s)]
*  You see, let me put it in an easier way, a clearer way. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2647.0s)]
*  Whether it was the Civil War or whether it is what they're doing now, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2651.0s)]
*  the Democrat Party doesn't have to be a political party. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2655.0s)]
*  Whether it was the Civil War or whether it is what they're doing now, [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2658.0s)]
*  the Democrat Party does not believe in Americanism. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2661.0s)]
*  That's the bottom line. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2664.0s)]
*  Slavery is not Americanism. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2666.0s)]
*  Destroying the Union is not Americanism. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2668.0s)]
*  Destroying our civil society, which is now the aim of the Democrat Party, that's not Americanism. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2672.0s)]
*  It's the anti-American Party and the activists are un-American. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2678.0s)]
*  That's why I wrote the book, The Democrat Party Hates America. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2682.0s)]
*  And they are joined by the isolationists and the other munchkins, [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2686.0s)]
*  the other mental midgets, [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2690.0s)]
*  and so much of what they're doing to this country, which is why I'll call them all out. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2693.0s)]
*  I don't give a damn. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2696.0s)]
*  People need to know the truth. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2699.0s)]
*  They need to know the truth. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2702.0s)]
*  Here's Swalwell. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2705.0s)]
*  Swalwell. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2708.0s)]
*  A complete lowlife. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2710.0s)]
*  Actually, in every respect, [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2713.0s)]
*  ICE deportations are terrorizing Americans. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2716.0s)]
*  Are you terrorized America? [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2719.0s)]
*  You feel terrorized America? I'm just curious. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2721.0s)]
*  By ICE deportations, what would they have us do? [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2724.0s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you what they would have us do. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2727.0s)]
*  Violate our immigration laws because that's what they're calling for. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2729.0s)]
*  Turn them inside out. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2734.0s)]
*  And all the people who are here illegally, [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2737.0s)]
*  whether they are horrendous criminals or not, [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2740.0s)]
*  get amnesty so they can win the House with apportionment [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2743.0s)]
*  and so they can win the presidency with votes. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2748.0s)]
*  That's it. Power hungry. That's all. That's it. Bottom line. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2751.0s)]
*  Here's Swalwell. Cut ten. Go. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2756.0s)]
*  No, it's terrorizing Americans, our friends and neighbors, otherwise known. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2758.0s)]
*  I don't know about your friends and neighbors, but mine don't feel terrorized. Are yours, Mr. Producer? [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2762.0s)]
*  Not in the least. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2767.0s)]
*  Not in the least. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2770.0s)]
*  I heard somebody say, they're going into our churches and our schools. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2773.0s)]
*  They're going into restaurants. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2776.0s)]
*  Where the hell else are you going to find people, Mr. Producer? [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2778.0s)]
*  I've made this point before. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2781.0s)]
*  Where are you going to find them? [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2783.0s)]
*  In churches, in schools, in restaurants, in clothing stores? [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2784.0s)]
*  I mean, they're coming everywhere. Exactly. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2788.0s)]
*  People are free to leave on their own and then they get in line. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2793.0s)]
*  I think there's a ten-year waiting period if you've come in illegally. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2797.0s)]
*  But if you're deported, in most cases, you're banned for life. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2800.0s)]
*  Now, it's too bad Swalwell never raised a finger in concern of the girls and the women [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2807.0s)]
*  sold into sex slavery as a result of his party's open border policies. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2814.0s)]
*  It's too bad he never left a finger of concern in any way [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2818.0s)]
*  for the 325,000 unaccompanied minors who were sold into God knows what and who are missing. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2823.0s)]
*  They didn't care about any of them. None of them. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2829.0s)]
*  But when you're deporting criminals and other people who are here illegally, [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2832.0s)]
*  whether they be criminals or not, that's the penalty. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2836.0s)]
*  You're deported. You're here illegally. You get to leave. That's it. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2840.0s)]
*  That's it. Why is this so horrible? [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2845.0s)]
*  And they use this rhetoric that they're terrorizing our neighbors and friends, terrorizing them. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2849.0s)]
*  They're like the Gestapo. Isn't that what Walt said? The idiot from Minnesota, something like that? [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2859.0s)]
*  It's incredible. Go ahead. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2866.0s)]
*  No, it's terrorizing Americans, our friends and neighbors, otherwise known as immigrants, many of them. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2869.0s)]
*  But these are folks who, you know, they go to our churches, they work at our grocery stores, [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2876.0s)]
*  they work on construction sites, they work in China. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2881.0s)]
*  I don't know why this is supposed to be pulling at one's heart because, yes, they do all these things in our country. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2884.0s)]
*  They're located in all these places. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2891.0s)]
*  Where else would they be located if they're not located in these places? Seriously, I mean, there's 21 million at least. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2895.0s)]
*  Wait a minute. They're in our schools, our churches, our grocery stores. They're over here. They're in the restaurants. Yes, of course. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2902.0s)]
*  Crazy. Go ahead. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2912.0s)]
*  Work in many jobs that would not be filled had they not done it. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2914.0s)]
*  How many more times are we going to hear this? [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2919.0s)]
*  And we Americans are lazy, stupid. We don't want to work. What would we do without the huddled masses? [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2923.0s)]
*  Yearning to be on welfare who come into our country. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2930.0s)]
*  I'm so sick of this lie, this so propaganda. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2935.0s)]
*  People want to come into this country and then come in legally. You're welcome. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2940.0s)]
*  Show allegiance to the country. Don't sneak in here. Don't come on student visas. Overstay your visas. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2943.0s)]
*  Join in the River to the Sea crowd, the Burning of the American Flag crowd. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2949.0s)]
*  We're not stupid, you moron. We know what the hell's going on. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2953.0s)]
*  We see it with our own two eyes. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2956.0s)]
*  You jerk. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2958.0s)]
*  I'll be right back. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2962.0s)]
*  If you're with one of the big three wireless carriers, you're really overpaying for your service, period. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2971.0s)]
*  You're paying for thousands of retail stores you never go into. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2976.0s)]
*  You're paying for unnecessary perks you never use. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2979.0s)]
*  You're paying a massive premium for what you think is superior 5G service. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2982.0s)]
*  Guess what? PureTalk uses the same 5G network on the same 5G towers. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2987.0s)]
*  The only difference, they don't charge you for any of the garbage. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2992.0s)]
*  Instead, PureTalk gives you unlimited talk, text, plenty of data for just 25 bucks a month. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=2995.0s)]
*  Folks, that's less than half the price of the big guys during a time when saving a buck really matters. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3001.0s)]
*  I am a PureTalk customer I have been for years. I made the switch. It's easy. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3007.0s)]

*  We have a Supreme Court decision today, even though the justices are at least said to be on vacation. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3037.0s)]
*  From the Associated Depressed, the Supreme Court today cleared the way for President Trump's plans to downsize the federal workforce. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3044.0s)]
*  Despite warnings that critical government services will be lost and hundreds of thousands of federal employees will be out of their jobs. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3054.0s)]
*  It's a long run on sentence, but it's not a matter of the court. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3061.0s)]
*  It's a long run on sentence because they don't really know proper English over the Associated Depressed. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3065.0s)]
*  But that aside, is that the story? [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3071.0s)]
*  The story is once again the Supreme Court stepped in to reverse one of these lower courts that was upheld, I think, by the panel in the Ninth Circuit for violating its constitutional role. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3077.0s)]
*  The decision was 8 to 1. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3090.0s)]
*  Now Justice Jackson, I think, needs to be medicated or something. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3092.0s)]
*  Maybe she just needs help because she was another 14, 15 page absolutely unhinged opinion and she was on her own in this one. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3098.0s)]
*  Way over her head, that's part of the problem. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3106.0s)]
*  The President of the United States wants a reduction in force. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3112.0s)]
*  Presidents do this all the time. They don't need Congress's affirmative okay. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3118.0s)]
*  Because Congress, there's separation of powers. They have control over the spending, the spending clauses we call it. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3125.0s)]
*  But the President manages the executive branch, not Congress. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3133.0s)]
*  And if he's combining agencies and he wants a reduction in force, he can do it. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3139.0s)]
*  How do I know that? Because in the Reagan administration we did that and our agency had a reduction in force ready for this Mr. Producer of 88%. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3143.0s)]
*  88%. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3152.0s)]
*  We didn't go to Congress and get permission. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3155.0s)]
*  So the Supreme Court 8 to 1 said, no the President, he can downside the federal workforce. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3160.0s)]
*  It's an unsigned order. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3166.0s)]
*  They weren't dealing with any specific cuts per se. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3168.0s)]
*  But so what? He can give a directive to agencies to undertake job reductions and that's what he did. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3172.0s)]
*  Now if he can't do that, then what the hell can he do as the President of the United States running the executive branch? [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3179.0s)]
*  Congress isn't a superior branch. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3185.0s)]
*  Just because they have control over the power of the purse doesn't mean these kind of ministerial or if you will administrative decisions [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3188.0s)]
*  are to be made by 535 members of Congress. Of course not. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3194.0s)]
*  No way. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3200.0s)]
*  And so Katanji Brown Jackson, the only dissent, and she accuses her colleagues, all eight of them, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3203.0s)]
*  of a demonstrated enthusiasm for green lighting this President's legally dubious actions in an emergency posture. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3212.0s)]
*  Quote unquote, she writes political comments after political comments after political comments. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3219.0s)]
*  And Sotomayor was out there too. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3224.0s)]
*  Not in this decision, but in no decision. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3226.0s)]
*  Just flapping her lips about how this court basically represents Donald Trump. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3229.0s)]
*  When this court, at least for now to its credit, is trying to stop these rogue district courts. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3236.0s)]
*  Now the AP goes on to tell you what might happen with these reductions in for who cares. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3243.0s)]
*  The issue here is who gets to make the decision. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3248.0s)]
*  And the Ninth Circuit panel was a two to one, by the way. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3251.0s)]
*  A two to one. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3256.0s)]
*  That was reversed. Eight to one. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3258.0s)]
*  Now by my calculations, that means two of the three stooges joined with the Constitution with well. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3261.0s)]
*  Three Constitutionalists. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3267.0s)]
*  One fairly good and then two of the Gadfla's. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3270.0s)]
*  But nonetheless, eight to one. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3275.0s)]
*  Among the agencies affected writes AP, Ag, Energy, Labor, they're all affected. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3278.0s)]
*  You just said he put out an executive order to the entire federal government. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3283.0s)]
*  But they just want you to know. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3287.0s)]
*  They just want you to know that it's out there. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3291.0s)]
*  So the President wins this one. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3293.0s)]
*  The American people win this one. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3295.0s)]
*  Separation of powers wins this one. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3297.0s)]
*  I told you about that judge in Boston, pointed by Obama, whose name is very complicated. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3302.0s)]
*  And she's a radical kook. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3309.0s)]
*  A radical lawyer in black robe. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3313.0s)]
*  Where she said that the president is a radical. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3316.0s)]
*  A radical lawyer in black robe. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3319.0s)]
*  Where she said that the funding of Planned Parenthood to defund it violates free speech and due process. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3322.0s)]
*  So what she's saying is, Congress can't defund Planned Parenthood. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3329.0s)]
*  Because it's not fair and it violates the Constitution. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3337.0s)]
*  This is so stupid, it's beyond belief. It really is. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3340.0s)]
*  So stupid. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3344.0s)]
*  That Planned Parenthood has a right to your tax dollars even if Congress says no? [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3347.0s)]
*  This is not only a violation of separation of powers. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3352.0s)]
*  Where does this judge created by Congress, who has jurisdiction created by Congress, [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3355.0s)]
*  come off telling Congress they can't do what Congress has every right to do? [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3359.0s)]
*  Which is to defund an organization, a private, non-profit organization. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3363.0s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3368.0s)]
*  You think they'd say that's okay if it were the National Rifle Association? [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3369.0s)]
*  Or a pro-life organization? [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3373.0s)]
*  Would it even enter anybody's mind? Would it? No. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3375.0s)]
*  Planned Parenthood is like their... [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3379.0s)]
*  It's their baby. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3382.0s)]
*  Actually, it's not their baby since they abort them. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3383.0s)]
*  But you get my point. Founded by eugenicist Margaret Sanger. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3386.0s)]
*  Margaret Sanger was a big hit. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3391.0s)]
*  In New Jersey and other places on the Ku Klux Klan speaking circuit. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3394.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's who she was. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3400.0s)]
*  Margaret Sanger. Eugenics. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3402.0s)]
*  Eugenics. Who said? [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3405.0s)]
*  The promoters of eugenics said it was for... [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3408.0s)]
*  The mentally ill, although they called them something else. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3412.0s)]
*  People who are physically disformed. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3415.0s)]
*  And the N-word. That's what they said. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3419.0s)]
*  The N-word. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3422.0s)]
*  In order to purify the population. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3423.0s)]
*  Hitler thought it was great, by the way. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3425.0s)]
*  If you're with one of the big three wireless carriers, [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3428.0s)]
*  you're really overpaying for your service, period. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3431.0s)]
*  You're paying for thousands of retail stores you never go into. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3433.0s)]
*  You're paying for unnecessary perks you never use. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3436.0s)]
*  You're paying a massive premium for what you think is superior 5G service. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3439.0s)]
*  Guess what? PureTalk uses the same 5G network on the same 5G towers. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3444.0s)]
*  The only difference? They don't charge you for any of the garbage. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3450.0s)]
*  Instead, PureTalk gives you unlimited talk, text, plenty of data for just 25 bucks a month. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3453.0s)]
*  Folks, that's less than half the price of the big guys during a time when saving a buck really matters. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3459.0s)]
*  I am a PureTalk customer I have been for years. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3464.0s)]
*  I made the switch. It's easy. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3467.0s)]
*  You can even keep your phone and your number. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3469.0s)]

*  Let me give you an example of what I mean, what I was talking about earlier with these sites and these crazy asses who claim to be MAGA. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3507.0s)]
*  And they're not. They're just crazy asses who claim to be MAGA. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3515.0s)]
*  I've told you about this site Mediokorite. It's founded by Dan Abrams. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3522.0s)]
*  It's loaded with leftists. It's got a few throw-ins there, but mostly leftists. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3528.0s)]
*  And Dan Abrams, I don't know if he's still an ABC News legal analyst. I don't know. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3535.0s)]
*  He's still the Jerry Springer of cable. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3542.0s)]
*  But his so-called media empire is built on this kind of insanity, inanity. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3545.0s)]
*  So let's read some titles. Elon Musk's Grok gets extremely anti-Semitic after latest update. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3552.0s)]
*  Really? If you go on MediaEight's comments section, whenever I'm mentioned, you ought to see the anti-Semitism there. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3558.0s)]
*  And Dan Abrams doesn't do a damn thing about it. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3566.0s)]
*  This was written by Ahmad Austin Jr. You would think Ahmad Austin Jr. might check the comments section every now and then, but I guess not. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3569.0s)]
*  Next title. You know about this? Trump whispers to Hegsett during reporters' question. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3577.0s)]
*  Megyn Kelly hits Trump for fuming over Epstein questioning cabinet meeting. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3583.0s)]
*  I don't know what that all means. Trump's stunts would not answer on who paused U.S. weapons shipments to Ukraine. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3591.0s)]
*  Trump's Epstein betrayal won't cost him anything. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3598.0s)]

*  This is his site. Elon Musk warns Trump about stonewalling on Epstein files and firing new posts. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3618.0s)]
*  Well, who cares? Why is that news? Because they want it to be. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3625.0s)]

*  Now look, I think Bannon's a fat pig, but honestly, I don't think he's in the Epstein files. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3659.0s)]
*  Do you, Mr. Professor? I doubt it. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3664.0s)]
*  Ay, ay, ay. I doubt it very much. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3669.0s)]
*  I mean, he has his standards, you know. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3674.0s)]
*  I mean, he did plead a fraud, but he does have his standards. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3678.0s)]
*  Trump ominously threatens the corrupt media. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3682.0s)]
*  Changes are going to be made. Trump, you see how Trump, Trump, Trump, they can't help it. This is Dan Abrams. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3686.0s)]

*  Here's this guy breaking his ass and everybody's trying to save lives and find bodies. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3704.0s)]
*  And this is the headline that Tommy Christopher has over at MediaEye. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3709.0s)]
*  I hear AOC is going to beat him. Trump taunts Chuck Schumer. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3714.0s)]
*  It's not Chuck Schumer, it's Chuck Schumer the Palestinian. Let's get that straight. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3718.0s)]
*  And it goes on. This is, oh, there's more. Hold on. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3722.0s)]
*  Most popular. Alex Jones breaks down in tears while condemning Trump over Epstein's cover up. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3726.0s)]
*  You see, folks, my point is that Abrams and MediaOakery and the Drudge Report [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3732.0s)]
*  and the New York Times and the Washington Post and CNN and they need the knuckleheads. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3738.0s)]
*  They need the morons. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3744.0s)]
*  And they use them as the face and voice of MAGA. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3749.0s)]
*  They're not. They're not the face and voice of MAGA. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3757.0s)]
*  And then, of course, they try and smear Donald Trump every step of the way while they defended Biden every step of the way. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3763.0s)]
*  Right? [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3769.0s)]
*  So this is just basically a Democrat front organization, Mediocre Right. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3774.0s)]
*  And everybody who writes for it is a fraud and a phony as far as I'm concerned. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3778.0s)]
*  And there's nothing particularly useful, profound, intelligent in any of this. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3784.0s)]
*  They just take other people's words, they twist them and put a hot headline on there [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3790.0s)]
*  because they're paid by the hip. They're paid by the eyes. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3795.0s)]
*  And that's the new media, I'm afraid to tell you. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3799.0s)]
*  That's what it's become, unfortunately, in the eyes of many. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3803.0s)]
*  That's why so many of you listen to radio and watch Fox. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3810.0s)]
*  I'm quite honest about that. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3816.0s)]
*  Now what about illegal aliens getting amnesty if they work on farms? [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3820.0s)]
*  Is that what the president proposed? People got all worked up about it. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3825.0s)]
*  I don't blame them. But that's not what the president is proposing. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3829.0s)]
*  Facts matter. OK? [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3834.0s)]
*  Cut 12 at today's cabinet meeting. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3837.0s)]
*  It'll be President Trump and then Secretary of Agriculture, Brooke Rollins. Go. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3841.0s)]
*  There's no amnesty. What we're doing is we're getting rid of criminals. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3846.0s)]
*  But we are doing a work program. Do you want to explain that, please? [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3850.0s)]
*  Yeah, this morning we talked about, of course, this was a top of mind question. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3853.0s)]
*  This morning we talked about protecting the farmers and the farmland. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3857.0s)]
*  But obviously this president's vision of no amnesty, mass deportation continues, [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3860.0s)]
*  but in a strategic way and then ensuring that our farmers have the labor that they need. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3865.0s)]
*  Secretary Chavez-Durimer has been a leader on this. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3871.0s)]
*  Obviously this comes out of the Labor Department. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3873.0s)]
*  But moving toward automation, ensuring that our farmers have that workforce [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3875.0s)]
*  and moving toward an American workforce. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3879.0s)]
*  So all of the above. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3881.0s)]
*  We've got to give the farmers the people they need, but we're not talking amnesty. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3883.0s)]
*  There's no amnesty. Of course, his concern is we need to get workers in these farms [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3890.0s)]
*  that we're going to go hungry. It's that simple. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3894.0s)]
*  Talk about a supply chain. Supply chain won't matter if you don't have a supply. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3896.0s)]
*  Here's my question to you. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3900.0s)]
*  Mr. Perdue, would you ever think that Donald Trump would support amnesty like this? [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3904.0s)]
*  It doesn't even cross my mind. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3909.0s)]
*  So people take his words from the other night and they twist them. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3911.0s)]
*  And then they beat their chest. They get more eyes, right? [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3915.0s)]
*  They get more clicks. They get more hits. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3919.0s)]
*  And create this phony issue. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3922.0s)]
*  This phony issue. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3925.0s)]
*  And they say, I hear this from so-and-so and I've heard this from so-and-so. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3928.0s)]
*  And they regurgitate it. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3932.0s)]
*  And they never walk these things back. They never apologized to it. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3935.0s)]
*  You know what? I apologize. I was wrong. No, they don't. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3939.0s)]
*  They don't. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3944.0s)]
*  Well, now you heard it for the president. You heard it from Brooke Rollins. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3948.0s)]
*  I don't know Brooke Rollins, but you heard it. And here's more. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3951.0s)]
*  Cut 13. Go. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3954.0s)]
*  There will be no amnesty. The mass deportations continue, but in a strategic way. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3956.0s)]
*  And we move the workforce towards automation and 100% American participation, [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3960.0s)]
*  which again with 34 million people, able-bodied adults on Medicaid, [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3965.0s)]
*  we should be able to do that fairly quickly. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3969.0s)]
*  That's what you're trying to explain. They want to... [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3971.0s)]
*  They're reformers, America. That's why you like them. That's why you want them. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3974.0s)]
*  And they're trying to figure out how to get people who are not working on Medicaid, [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3977.0s)]
*  who are able-bodied, enabled mind, to do this work. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3982.0s)]
*  And so they're trying to develop a program. I'm just reading between the lines here. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3987.0s)]
*  Cut 14. Go. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3992.0s)]
*  But very quickly and perhaps the most important, the first of the seven, [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3994.0s)]
*  is securing and protecting American farmland ownership, [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=3998.0s)]
*  actively engaging at every level of government to take swift legislative and executive action... [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4002.0s)]
*  And here's where she's talking about keeping farmland in America under American ownership, [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4007.0s)]
*  away from the communist Chinese and other such governments. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4012.0s)]
*  That's a good thing, right? Go ahead. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4016.0s)]
*  The purchase of American farmland by Chinese nationals and other foreign adversaries, [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4020.0s)]
*  standing on the shoulders of great governors, three of whom are standing behind me, [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4026.0s)]
*  who have already been leading the way on this issue, [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4030.0s)]
*  and at the federal government level working to do everything within our ability, [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4033.0s)]
*  including presidential authorities, to claw back what has already been purchased by China [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4039.0s)]
*  and other foreign adversaries. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4045.0s)]
*  Additionally, working with the Treasury of the, Secretary of the Treasury, [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4047.0s)]
*  along with our Defense Department on memorandums, [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4051.0s)]
*  to ensure that moving forward there is a much more intentional look at who is buying what in this country [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4054.0s)]
*  and from where they are in the world. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4061.0s)]
*  Okay, that's a good move, right? I think so. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4065.0s)]
*  You're going to find some hosts on radio and TV who are trying to walk the fine line on this issue, [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4070.0s)]
*  on the Epstein issue and so forth, because they don't have gonads. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4077.0s)]
*  They don't have a spine. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4080.0s)]
*  This is where we are right now. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4084.0s)]
*  Here's what the President said about Epstein when this matter came up. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4089.0s)]
*  Here he is talking about war of peace with Russia and Ukraine. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4094.0s)]
*  He's talking about what he's trying to do with Hamas and how they're trying to free the hostages. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4100.0s)]
*  Here he's talking about the border and the Communist Chinese buying up land. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4104.0s)]
*  And then there's this, 15. Go ahead. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4109.0s)]
*  Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein? [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4112.0s)]
*  This guy's been talked about for years. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4114.0s)]
*  You're asking, we have Texas, we have this, we have all of the things. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4117.0s)]
*  And are people still talking about this guy, this creep? [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4122.0s)]
*  That is unbelievable. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4126.0s)]
*  Do you want to waste the time and do you feel like answering? [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4129.0s)]
*  I don't mind answering. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4132.0s)]
*  I mean, I can't believe you're asking a question on Epstein at a time like this, [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4133.0s)]
*  where we're having some of the greatest success and also tragedy with what happened in Texas. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4137.0s)]
*  It just seems like a desecration. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4143.0s)]
*  I agree with him 100%. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4146.0s)]
*  I'm not an outlier, neither are you. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4149.0s)]
*  You're all listening and you're shaking your head. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4151.0s)]
*  Yes. If I go down again the street right now and I asked them what the priorities in this country are, [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4153.0s)]
*  they're going to agree with us. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4157.0s)]
*  We agree with the President on this. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4159.0s)]
*  And we don't buy into the conspiracy theories that three conservatives, [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4162.0s)]
*  one of whom is a dear friend, Bonjira, they all got together and decided they're going to cover up for Epstein. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4165.0s)]
*  There's no rationality to that. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4171.0s)]
*  And that's why you get Chatsworth Cotarrelson saying he believes that the American intelligence [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4173.0s)]
*  and the Israeli intelligence are somehow behind this. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4179.0s)]
*  These are loony tunes, okay? [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4184.0s)]
*  Loony tunes. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4187.0s)]
*  I'll be right back. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4189.0s)]
*  Mud Club in. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4190.0s)]
*  If you're with one of the big three wireless carriers, you're really overpaying for your service, period. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4198.0s)]

*  You're paying for unnecessary perks you never use. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4206.0s)]
*  You're paying a massive premium for what you think is superior 5G service. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4209.0s)]
*  Guess what? [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4214.0s)]
*  Pure Talk uses the same 5G network on the same 5G towers. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4215.0s)]

*  I am a Pure Talk customer. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4234.0s)]

*  To switch to Pure Talk, wireless by Americans for Americans. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4260.0s)]
*  You know, you have this stuff going on in Texas, which is horrendous. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4268.0s)]
*  The president's right. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4271.0s)]
*  You have the Democrats stoking violence against ICE. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4274.0s)]
*  On the other side of the ledger, you have all these great things being done. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4280.0s)]
*  And the Lilliputians want to focus on Epstein. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4286.0s)]
*  I just, it's just, they have their own business agenda, their own grifter agenda. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4289.0s)]
*  Then they act like they're angry, they're upset. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4298.0s)]
*  And so then they come up with these conspiracy theories. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4300.0s)]
*  Listen to this. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4306.0s)]
*  Fox. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4307.0s)]
*  FBI launches criminal investigations of John Brennan and James Comey, DOJ sources. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4308.0s)]
*  Former CIA Director John Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey are under criminal investigation [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4313.0s)]
*  for potential wrongdoing related to the Trump-Russia probe, including allegedly making false statements to Congress [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4319.0s)]
*  Justice Department sources told Fox News Digital. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4325.0s)]
*  Now this wouldn't be happening if Trump didn't win. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4328.0s)]
*  It wouldn't be happening if Pam Bondi wasn't head of the Department of Justice [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4331.0s)]
*  or Cash Patel and Bongino weren't head of the FBI. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4334.0s)]
*  None of this. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4337.0s)]
*  CIA Director John Ratcliffe referred evidence of wrongdoing by Brennan to FBI Director Cash Patel for potential prosecution. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4338.0s)]
*  DOJ sources tell Fox News Digital. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4347.0s)]
*  Sources said that the referral was received and told Fox News Digital a criminal investigation into Brennan was open and is underway. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4351.0s)]
*  DOJ sources declined to provide further details. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4358.0s)]
*  It's unclear at this point. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4361.0s)]
*  The investigation spans beyond his alleged false statements to Congress. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4363.0s)]
*  As for Comey, DOJ sources told Fox News Digital an investigation into the former directors underway. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4366.0s)]
*  They couldn't share details of course. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4372.0s)]
*  Wow, another conspiracy, huh? [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4376.0s)]
*  I shall return. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4378.0s)]
*  Hello America, Mark Levin here. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4409.0s)]
*  Our number 877-381-3811. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4411.0s)]
*  877-381-3811. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4415.0s)]
*  I hope you're well, folks. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4422.0s)]
*  I want to make you aware. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4424.0s)]
*  Let's see here. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4426.0s)]
*  The Reagan Library is sold out. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4428.0s)]
*  It's been sold out for several days now. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4430.0s)]
*  I told people it would happen. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4432.0s)]
*  I wish they had a thousand more seats, but they don't. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4434.0s)]
*  But we have two other great book signings. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4437.0s)]
*  So it's a total of three. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4440.0s)]
*  The other two are wide open. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4442.0s)]
*  They're never sold out because you get in line and so forth. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4444.0s)]
*  So I wanted to mention these to you. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4447.0s)]
*  August 2nd, Saturday at 1 p.m. at Book Ends. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4451.0s)]
*  This is kind of traditional for us. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4455.0s)]
*  And that's Ridgewood Avenue in Ridgewood, New Jersey. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4457.0s)]
*  And there is a link there on all my social sites if you want to check it out and get more details. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4461.0s)]
*  But it's a beautiful bookstore, an independent bookstore. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4466.0s)]
*  It's a mom-pa store. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4469.0s)]
*  Ridgewood, New Jersey is a beautiful town. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4471.0s)]
*  I like it very much. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4474.0s)]
*  And its Book Ends is the name of the store. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4475.0s)]
*  We like to give them business where we can. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4479.0s)]
*  That's 1 p.m. on Saturday, August 2nd. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4481.0s)]
*  Then the following week, Saturday, August 9th at 10 a.m., [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4486.0s)]
*  Barnes & Noble, the Spectrum at Reston Town Center in Reston, Virginia. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4490.0s)]
*  That's my old haunt there. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4496.0s)]
*  I used to go to that Barnes & Noble and then they shut it down for a period of years. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4499.0s)]
*  And now they've reopened it. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4503.0s)]
*  Barnes & Noble has expanded. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4504.0s)]
*  And they're doing a great job. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4506.0s)]
*  So that's Saturday, August 9th, 10 a.m., Barnes & Noble, [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4508.0s)]
*  Spectrum at Reston Town Center. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4513.0s)]
*  Again, you can go on my social sites and there's a link. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4515.0s)]
*  If there's more information you like. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4518.0s)]
*  So mark the dates and times down if you can on your calendar. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4520.0s)]
*  I can't wait to see you. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4522.0s)]
*  So we've got that one in Virginia, one in New Jersey. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4525.0s)]
*  And of course, we're going to be doing the Reagan Library in California. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4528.0s)]
*  That will be all the signings that I'm able to do. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4531.0s)]
*  We have a major launch that's going to take place all throughout Talk Radio, [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4535.0s)]
*  throughout other media. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4540.0s)]
*  And some of our favorite shows on Fox. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4542.0s)]
*  And here, of course, this is Ground Zero. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4545.0s)]
*  So one more time and we'll repeat them over the course of the next few weeks. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4550.0s)]
*  Saturday, August 2nd, 1 p.m., bookends in Ridgewood, New Jersey. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4553.0s)]
*  And the next weekend, Saturday, August 9th, 10 a.m. at Barnes & Noble, [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4558.0s)]
*  Reston Town Center in Reston, Virginia. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4563.0s)]
*  We usually do Tyson's Corner, but I thought we'd start things up a little bit. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4566.0s)]
*  And go to Reston. They have a very easy parking area, [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4569.0s)]
*  access to restaurants and all the rest of it. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4573.0s)]
*  Reston Town Center is actually quite nice. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4575.0s)]
*  Quite nice. And I think you'll like it a lot. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4578.0s)]
*  Chuck Schumer, is there any, is there a bigger low-life? [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4584.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, there is actually. There are other low-lives. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4586.0s)]
*  The Democrat Party have so many of them, it's hard to differentiate one from the other. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4589.0s)]
*  But I like the fact that Donald Trump calls him a Palestinian. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4595.0s)]
*  Now, why does he call him a Palestinian? [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4599.0s)]
*  He calls him a Palestinian because here's a guy who pretends to support Israel. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4601.0s)]
*  He's either Jewish or half Jewish and has spent his entire career [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4607.0s)]
*  undermining the state of Israel if there is a prime minister who he doesn't like. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4610.0s)]
*  So that's pretty creepy, isn't it? [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4617.0s)]
*  And he has to sort of saddle up with AOC and Haryl. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4621.0s)]
*  And he has not condemned the candidate in New York City, this guy Zoran Mandani, [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4627.0s)]
*  if that is his name, he's a complete fraud, phony, fake. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4635.0s)]
*  A complete fraud, phony, fake. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4639.0s)]
*  And the more that comes out about him, the worse he is. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4643.0s)]
*  The worse he is. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4647.0s)]
*  Let's see here. I have a story on this guy. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4650.0s)]
*  I don't know that I can find it in time. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4654.0s)]
*  Let's see here. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4656.0s)]
*  Oh, cut 17, go. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4662.0s)]
*  I got a Palestinian senator. His name is Schumer. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4664.0s)]
*  He's a great Palestinian. No, he's a Palestinian. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4668.0s)]
*  He's become a Palestinian. He's abandoned the Jews. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4671.0s)]
*  But I saw him say, it's Trump's fault. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4674.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's right. It's Trump's fault. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4678.0s)]
*  He was actually, do you ever see John Lovitz, the liar? [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4681.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4684.0s)]
*  Where he goes, yeah, yeah, I went to Harvard. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4685.0s)]
*  That's the ticket. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4687.0s)]
*  This was Schumer. He goes, yeah, yeah, it's Trump's fault. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4688.0s)]
*  That's right. It's Trump's fault. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4693.0s)]
*  I actually saw that stupid guy try and blame it on me. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4695.0s)]
*  And I said, man, that's a tough one to take. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4698.0s)]
*  But his career is limited because I hear AOC is going to beat him. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4702.0s)]
*  And she's no bargain either, by the way. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4705.0s)]
*  The New York Post has done a great job on the Zoran Mamdani. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4707.0s)]
*  It's a great newspaper, it really is. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4714.0s)]
*  Zoran Mamdani may be a lightweight, they write, in his own right, [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4717.0s)]
*  but as mayor he'd bring an entire extremist movement along with him [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4720.0s)]
*  to city hall with dire consequences for the city. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4723.0s)]
*  Mamdani can hem and haul all he likes, [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4728.0s)]
*  but he's the face of a truly radical movement, [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4730.0s)]
*  the Democratic Socialists of America, [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4732.0s)]
*  which boasts of being truly anti-capitalist [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4734.0s)]
*  and indeed looking to seize the means of production, [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4737.0s)]
*  which is Marxist, as anyone could ask. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4739.0s)]
*  Zoran himself just a few years ago lectured about how socialists needed [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4744.0s)]
*  to be honest about their goals, that he's changed his tune merely means [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4748.0s)]
*  he's now more interested in winning elections. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4752.0s)]
*  After all, this is a guy who said that identifying himself as an African-American [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4755.0s)]
*  just because he was born in Uganda would be fundamentally misleading, [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4759.0s)]
*  but he did just that when applying to Colombia. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4763.0s)]
*  As mayor, he would at the very least bring a host of fellow DSA believers, [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4766.0s)]
*  aka Marxist Islamists, to the highest reaches of city government. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4771.0s)]
*  And the DSA is a lot harder left than the Working Families Party, [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4776.0s)]
*  you believe that? [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4781.0s)]
*  Which has always been mainly a vehicle for unions [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4783.0s)]
*  and other so-called progressive interests to boost their influence. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4786.0s)]
*  The DSA's constitution, that is this Marxist Islamist group, [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4790.0s)]
*  is frank about the party's belief. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4793.0s)]
*  It says, quote, [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4795.0s)]
*  We reject an economic order based on private profit. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4796.0s)]
*  It seeks a social order based on popular control of resources [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4799.0s)]
*  and production and economic planning. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4802.0s)]
*  As Santiago Vidal Calvo notes for The Post, [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4806.0s)]
*  these ideas have wrought disaster wherever tried, [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4809.0s)]
*  impoverishing society as a whole, even as the socialist elite prospers. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4812.0s)]
*  Already, ex-Representative Jamal Bowman, remember him, [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4817.0s)]
*  is rumored as Mondami's pick for school's chancellor. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4820.0s)]
*  As a so-called educator, [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4824.0s)]
*  Bowman stood foursquare against standards in rigor and for DEI nonsense. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4826.0s)]
*  Imagine cop-hating Queen City Councilwoman Tiffany Caban [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4830.0s)]
*  and early Mondami supporter replacing Jessica Tisch as police commissioner, [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4835.0s)]
*  or other lefty radicals running the Department of Finance and Economic Development. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4839.0s)]
*  That group has been leveraging its way to power ever since its first marquee triumph, [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4844.0s)]
*  AOC's ouster of Queen's boss Joe Crowley, [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4848.0s)]
*  then the number four House Democrat in the 2019 primary. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4852.0s)]
*  Not exploiting the city's ridiculous public campaign finance system, [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4856.0s)]
*  and now the rank choice primary voting. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4860.0s)]
*  This rank choice is always used by people who can't win any other way, [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4863.0s)]
*  so they do it for this Democrat, they set it up and then this Democrat wins, [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4868.0s)]
*  and Lisa Murkowski did it in Alaska, and they have it now in California. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4872.0s)]
*  Beware, even if the voters fend off this takeover attempt, [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4876.0s)]
*  that party will keep on pushing. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4882.0s)]
*  Everyone else in politics, local politics, needs to get serious, [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4884.0s)]
*  not just about beating Mondami now, [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4887.0s)]
*  but treating all democratic socialists as completely toxic. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4890.0s)]
*  So the guy puts on his application that he's both Asian and black. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4893.0s)]
*  He's a liar. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4896.0s)]
*  But that's okay. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4899.0s)]
*  The guy is privileged, he comes from a fairly well-to-do family [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4902.0s)]
*  that came into the United States to escape repression elsewhere. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4906.0s)]
*  Now think about that. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4911.0s)]
*  All these punks, they're all sort of born with a platinum spoon, [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4915.0s)]
*  in their mouth, and they learn the propaganda. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4920.0s)]
*  I want to read something to you, if I may. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4925.0s)]
*  I think I may, since it's my show anyway. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4928.0s)]
*  There should be an explicit understanding of what it means [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4933.0s)]
*  and where it is headed when people talk about this kind of a welfare state. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4938.0s)]
*  To say, as an example, that the last time the people were in the United States, [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4942.0s)]
*  to say, as an example, that the last century saw this huge movement [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4947.0s)]
*  toward a massive welfare state, including entitlements and such, [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4952.0s)]
*  and that the American people have accepted it, [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4956.0s)]
*  and that these are the new rights that are now implicit in the Constitution, [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4959.0s)]
*  leaves a great deal unsaid and obscured about the future of governmental power. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4963.0s)]
*  It enables the advocates of economic and social rights [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4969.0s)]
*  to create virtually any kind of painting they wish, [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4972.0s)]
*  impressionist, post-impressionist, but mostly abstract. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4975.0s)]
*  When it is said that there need not be a socialist revolution [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4979.0s)]
*  associated with social and economic rights, [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4982.0s)]
*  well, that's a half-truth. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4986.0s)]
*  The government need not actually own the means of production, [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4989.0s)]
*  but it must regulate them. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4993.0s)]
*  Now this guy's talking about owning them. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4995.0s)]
*  And as the regulations prove insufficient, [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=4998.0s)]
*  as they cannot achieve the kind of economic and social equality, [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5000.0s)]
*  now termed equity, promised or expected, [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5003.0s)]
*  which are extravagant and impossible, [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5006.0s)]
*  the answer will not be to abandon this negative power for positive power [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5009.0s)]
*  associated with individual and societal rights and liberty, [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5013.0s)]
*  but to tighten the reins of control and centralization. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5016.0s)]
*  In fact, the target of beneficiaries and the true believers [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5020.0s)]
*  will become agitated and dissatisfied [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5024.0s)]
*  and demand more from the new ruling class [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5027.0s)]
*  when their hopes and expectations are unmet. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5030.0s)]
*  In short, government grows stronger and bigger, [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5033.0s)]
*  not less so at the expense of the individual and society. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5036.0s)]
*  Pages 1, 32, and 33 of On Power. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5039.0s)]
*  On Power. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5044.0s)]
*  When looking further into the struggle over rights, [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5047.0s)]
*  and most crucially, which rights approach will prevail, [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5050.0s)]
*  negative or positive, and you'll understand that when you read the book, [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5054.0s)]
*  we see there's a constant struggle to be the ruling class, [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5057.0s)]
*  a constant struggle within the ruling class, [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5061.0s)]
*  and a constant struggle between the people in the ruling class. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5064.0s)]
*  Again, it is a positive power in the rights approach of the founders [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5068.0s)]
*  that provides civil lanes for compromise, tolerance, [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5072.0s)]
*  moderation, and peaceful resolution, both in society and government. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5075.0s)]
*  Negative power, that would be the power of this Mamdani. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5079.0s)]
*  And the economic and social rights approach [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5083.0s)]
*  provide no such lanes, and in fact weaken those that exist. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5086.0s)]
*  To say that the people are satisfied and supportive [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5090.0s)]
*  of the mass of welfare state, a welfare state that is not static [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5093.0s)]
*  and in fact history shows always growing and consuming, [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5097.0s)]
*  is to say nothing about the accompanying centralization [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5101.0s)]
*  and coerciveness of government. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5105.0s)]
*  The role of the people continuously diminishes, [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5108.0s)]
*  including their ability to defend their individual and societal rights, [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5111.0s)]
*  to the extent such lanes do exist, [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5114.0s)]
*  it's just because what remains of rights from the founding period. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5117.0s)]
*  Again, just a taste. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5124.0s)]
*  I call this authoritarian democracy. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5127.0s)]
*  And in the case of this guy, Mamdani, it's even less democracy, [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5130.0s)]
*  but it's authoritarian democracy. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5134.0s)]
*  You vote, but you lose your rights. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5137.0s)]
*  You vote, but you lose your freedom. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5140.0s)]
*  And the vote becomes less and less meaningful, [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5143.0s)]
*  because the government becomes a permanent institution, [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5146.0s)]
*  and it just keeps growing and devouring and devouring and growing. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5149.0s)]
*  That's what this jerk, this Marxist Islamist pathological liar is offering. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5152.0s)]
*  I'll be right back. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5162.0s)]
*  I have a big interview I'm taping tomorrow, ladies and gentlemen, [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5173.0s)]
*  for Life, Liberty and Love in Saturday. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5182.0s)]
*  So I was thinking to myself, Mr. Producer, who should I interview? [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5186.0s)]
*  I was thinking, should I try Khomeini? [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5193.0s)]
*  You think he'd go for it? [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5195.0s)]
*  No? [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5198.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't know, Khomeini. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5201.0s)]
*  It was a constitutional right, our belief in free speech. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5204.0s)]
*  I mean, we went to war with Iran. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5209.0s)]
*  I might as well try and interview Khomeini, don't you think? [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5211.0s)]
*  I think so. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5214.0s)]
*  Sure. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5216.0s)]
*  I got to thinking, how about Maduro and Venezuela, [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5218.0s)]
*  as the Stalinist Bernie Sanders? [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5223.0s)]
*  I have so many questions. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5227.0s)]
*  What's the population of Venezuela? [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5229.0s)]
*  Can you look that up, Mr. Producer? [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5231.0s)]
*  I don't know it off the top of my head, and that's very, very significant. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5233.0s)]
*  So I was thinking, yeah, maybe I'll interview the president for Life of Venezuela. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5237.0s)]
*  28 million? [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5244.0s)]
*  OK, I'll be ready for that question then. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5246.0s)]
*  I thought, no, it's kind of insignificant. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5250.0s)]
*  It's kind of an insignificant figure. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5254.0s)]
*  Then I thought to myself, let me interview the inbred who runs Qatar. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5258.0s)]
*  But then I thought, well, wait a minute, that's been done, hasn't it? [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5263.0s)]
*  Oh yes, it has been done. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5266.0s)]
*  Very tough questions about how they are secreting themselves and their ideology [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5269.0s)]
*  with their billions of dollars into our country. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5274.0s)]
*  That's never been asked. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5277.0s)]
*  But then they've done that. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5280.0s)]
*  That's been done. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5282.0s)]
*  I thought, Putin, but if I go to Russia, I don't think I'll ever return. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5284.0s)]
*  Then I was thinking, what about Xi? [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5288.0s)]
*  Xi? [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5291.0s)]
*  I don't think he'd let me out of there either, but that would be a good one, don't you think? [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5295.0s)]
*  Now, I wouldn't ask him tough questions because, as we know, he wouldn't answer them anyway. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5299.0s)]
*  But I should ask them because of the American Constitution and free speech. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5306.0s)]
*  I think I should ask him some questions, don't you? [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5309.0s)]
*  Yeah, why not? Sure. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5312.0s)]
*  I understand I'll be criticized for it. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5315.0s)]
*  Of course. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5318.0s)]
*  Of course I'll be criticized for it. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5321.0s)]
*  Why, because I want to ask one of the greatest mass murders of our time, a question or two? [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5324.0s)]
*  Here's a big question. Why do you hate us? [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5331.0s)]
*  Why do you hate us? [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5335.0s)]
*  I thought that was a big, really good question. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5338.0s)]
*  Get to the nub of the matter. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5341.0s)]
*  Sure. There's all kinds of people out there. Oh, yeah. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5346.0s)]
*  Next thing you know, maybe we'll interview Bernie Sanders. That would be a good one. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5352.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. That'd be a good one. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5356.0s)]
*  I mean, after all, he's a senator. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5359.0s)]
*  I mean, we have the Constitution and free speech. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5361.0s)]
*  Of course, I have all these questions I want to ask Bernie Sanders. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5364.0s)]
*  I find myself agreeing with him more and more after all. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5369.0s)]
*  He doesn't want war either. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5373.0s)]
*  No, he's opposed to war. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5376.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. No, I won't be interviewing any of them, nor do I care to interview any of them. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5379.0s)]
*  But I'll tell you later. I can't tell you yet. I'll be right back. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5385.0s)]
*  His teachers didn't like his snide sense of humor. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5394.0s)]
*  Today, they still don't like it. Call Mark Levin now at 877-381-3811. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5398.0s)]
*  You ever think of your teachers when you were young? [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5408.0s)]
*  Sadly, for me, most of them probably aren't around, Mr. Producer. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5412.0s)]
*  I do that often. I think about the teachers that really mattered in my life. There were some. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5417.0s)]
*  They were quite good before the teachers union was even powerful. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5422.0s)]
*  Maybe there was a teachers union. There was a teachers association. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5426.0s)]
*  There was sort of a quasi-union early on. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5429.0s)]
*  But it wasn't this kind of a old, you know, East German type of a union, which it is today. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5432.0s)]
*  Let's go. Henderson, Texas. Mark Levin, APCA. Right ahead, please. Lynn. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5443.0s)]
*  Hi, Mark. It's actually Henderson, Nevada. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5450.0s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5454.0s)]
*  But I used to live in San Antonio, Texas. I lived there between 2020 and 2024. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5456.0s)]
*  And I just have to say, you know, I'm really sick of all the, you know, [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5465.0s)]
*  ignorant morons running their stupid obnoxious mouths about what's going on. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5470.0s)]
*  You know, absolutely nothing. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5475.0s)]
*  I, you know, spent a lot of time in New Braunfels and Fredericksburg. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5478.0s)]
*  And, you know, when I was frequently drive through Kerrville and I just stopped at the river because it's so, [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5483.0s)]
*  I mean, that area is so beautiful. It is absolutely breathtaking. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5490.0s)]
*  But one of the problems is that it is prone to flooding. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5495.0s)]
*  And as much as you try to prepare, you cannot. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5501.0s)]
*  You can't prepare for that. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5507.0s)]
*  That effectively was a tidal wave. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5510.0s)]
*  A tidal wave that went through there. That's what it was. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5514.0s)]
*  Yeah, and we would see flooding in San Antonio, too. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5517.0s)]
*  And I'm going to say I'm very, very proud of Governor Abbott and Senator Cruz and all of them and President Trump. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5521.0s)]
*  I know that they are doing everything they possibly can. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5530.0s)]
*  And Senator Cruz, I mean, you know, he was on vacation, but he was already on vacation. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5534.0s)]
*  But he returned immediately. I don't know what he's supposed to be supposed to predict in advance. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5542.0s)]
*  He turned around and came back as fast as he could. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5548.0s)]
*  He was there very fast. Exactly. Exactly. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5551.0s)]
*  But I am so proud of them. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5555.0s)]
*  I honestly wish he was still my senator. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5557.0s)]
*  I'm in Nevada for work, but I love Ted Cruz is a fantastic senator. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5561.0s)]
*  He is a fantastic individual. And and you're 100 percent right. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5567.0s)]
*  He's an old buddy of mine and he's just he's true to the core. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5573.0s)]
*  He really is. And thank you very much for your wonderful call. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5577.0s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5581.0s)]
*  Let's see here. I'm looking. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5583.0s)]
*  All right. Let's go to McAllen, Texas, XM satellite. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5587.0s)]
*  Tico, how are you, Tico? [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5592.0s)]
*  My gosh, it's great to talk to you, sir. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5595.0s)]
*  You are an inspiration and the only other person that I well, the one of the only few radio personalities [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5598.0s)]
*  I would ever say that to would be Mr. Rush Limbaugh. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5606.0s)]
*  I'm so happy to be on. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5609.0s)]
*  Before you before I forget, please don't let me forget to read an article about my dad that was written back in September 23rd, 1945. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5612.0s)]
*  When I spoke to your wonderful call screener, gosh, what a wonderful voice and articulate man. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5620.0s)]
*  And I say that in Christ, I'm not trying to be a good man or a smart aleck or anything. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5626.0s)]
*  Excellent. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5632.0s)]
*  And we he what I what I was saying at the time is this terrible tragedy that happened in Kerr County. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5633.0s)]
*  I'm not in McAllen right now, but I was born and raised there. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5642.0s)]
*  Those people that happened such as at a sudden it would not have made a big difference if they had a special warning system. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5646.0s)]
*  If you listen to some of the comments and look at some of the accounts on film that these people were were putting on social media, [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5657.0s)]
*  when the when one of the wives woke up and told the husband and they got out that that she thought that they needed to get moving, [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5667.0s)]
*  he said, oh, it's just another flood because it floods there all the time. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5675.0s)]
*  It's rock. There's no soil there for the for the water to go down. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5679.0s)]
*  And it was just a one of those things like Helene. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5683.0s)]
*  Right now I'm in South Carolina. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5686.0s)]
*  That was a terrible thing that happened here. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5689.0s)]
*  And it was the same type of situation where the weather just it was just a thousand year event, a five hundred year event, whatever you want to call it. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5691.0s)]
*  It doesn't happen to where these people or any kind of detection devices would work. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5701.0s)]
*  So imagine being Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries and literally sitting around and trying to use this as a weapon against your political opponents. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5707.0s)]
*  Donald Trump, is that not that that's so evil. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5717.0s)]
*  It's so inhumane. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5721.0s)]
*  And yet there they are. And the reporters are at it, too. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5723.0s)]
*  It's like, oh, my God, what the hell's happened to half our country? [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5726.0s)]
*  It's sick. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5730.0s)]
*  Feeters and they have nowhere else to turn and they hate this country. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5732.0s)]
*  They hate freedom and liberty, which, by the way, my article about my dad is on that before we before we lose time here. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5736.0s)]
*  Go ahead. OK. And thank you again for taking this call. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5744.0s)]
*  Marine forgets homesickness, releasing allied prisoners. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5747.0s)]
*  McAllen Monitor, September 23rd, 1945. McAllen homesickness in the Pacific is bad enough, but there is something worse. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5752.0s)]
*  A McAllen Marine lieutenant has written his parents. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5761.0s)]
*  It is the deplorable condition of many liberated American soldiers, which has caused plenty of their rescuing buddies to forget possible leave to come home as long as they can help remove JAP prison victims. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5764.0s)]
*  Lieutenant Barnett Cook, son of Mr. and Mrs. F.G. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5778.0s)]
*  Cook, was among the first Marine air pilots to fly over Formosa in search of obscure prison camps. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5782.0s)]
*  He and his companion, Chester, I don't think we're going to have enough time to read all this. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5789.0s)]
*  Tico, Mr. Badoo, so why don't you get a copy of this from him and I'll take a look at it and read parts of it. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5794.0s)]
*  We're not. We're up against it. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5800.0s)]
*  I'm sorry, Tico. The clock is my master here for now anyway. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5802.0s)]
*  And obviously the word JAP was in the article. We understand. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5806.0s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5809.0s)]
*  What? [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5811.0s)]
*  Hello, Ben. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5812.0s)]
*  So many heartbreaking stories. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5824.0s)]
*  I'm looking at a photo, Breitbart. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5832.0s)]
*  It's like a rescuer. He's kneeling down. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5835.0s)]
*  Covering his face with his hands, obviously. He's weeping. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5842.0s)]
*  Two young sisters killed during the devastating floods in central Texas [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5847.0s)]
*  sent a final text message to their family before they died. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5851.0s)]
*  Thirteen-year-old Blair and eleven-year-old Brooke Harbor of Dallas were located fifteen miles away in Caryville [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5858.0s)]
*  after the water carried them from a house and hunt. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5865.0s)]
*  Oh, beautiful little girls. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5870.0s)]
*  Their aunt Jennifer Harbor said the children were staying with their grandparents [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5873.0s)]
*  and Brooke sent the text message they read saying, I love you, at 3.30 a.m. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5878.0s)]
*  to their families. The storms intensified. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5883.0s)]
*  The girl's aunt told the Chronicle their hands were locked together when they were found. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5887.0s)]
*  She added that her parents, the girl's grandparents, have not yet been located. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5895.0s)]
*  Harbor said the family woke around 3.30 a.m. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5906.0s)]
*  Imagine it's pitch black and this is going on and the girl's father R.J. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5909.0s)]
*  went to check on them when they were sleeping in an upstairs loft. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5913.0s)]
*  When R.J. saw the water swiftly rising around the house, [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5917.0s)]
*  Harbor explained that someone broke a window as a way to escape. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5921.0s)]
*  The waters were too high to get our family, so he, R.J., went to other neighbors to borrow a kayak. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5925.0s)]
*  He woke two neighbors up for help and saved their lives and borrowed a kayak. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5932.0s)]
*  But the water had risen too high to reach the neighbor's house that my parents and nieces and their two dogs were in. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5937.0s)]
*  She recalled stating the girl's father was unable to navigate the flood waters and the kayak. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5945.0s)]
*  He and his wife Fanny escaped and the couple then watched as the flood washed homes and cars the community away. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5954.0s)]
*  The two sisters were students at St. Rita Catholic School in Dallas. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5962.0s)]
*  In a letter to its community, the school said the flash flooding along the Guadalupe River took the girl's lives. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5968.0s)]
*  Can you imagine this, Rich? [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5976.0s)]
*  Two little sweethearts. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5983.0s)]
*  The one texts [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5989.0s)]
*  her family [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5993.0s)]
*  saying, I love you at 3.30 a.m. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5994.0s)]
*  quote unquote. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=5998.0s)]
*  She must have known something was up. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6000.0s)]
*  They might not survive. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6003.0s)]
*  And they were found [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6007.0s)]
*  dead holding each other's hands. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6009.0s)]
*  They were locked together. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6011.0s)]
*  She just makes you want to just, I don't know. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6012.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6017.0s)]
*  You would think people would have perspective now, but they don't. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6019.0s)]
*  And [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6024.0s)]
*  you know, we all project our own family situation on the situations like this. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6027.0s)]
*  It's very difficult. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6032.0s)]
*  And I don't know. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6034.0s)]
*  Imagine that family, what they're suffering through, these two little girls, beautiful little girls. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6035.0s)]
*  It's just terrible. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6042.0s)]
*  I have to listen to all these, these buffoons. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6045.0s)]
*  And [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6050.0s)]
*  yet apparently [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6052.0s)]
*  they're not going to change. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6054.0s)]
*  There's this from the Washington Examiner. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6055.0s)]
*  And [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6058.0s)]
*  Russian deportation of thousands of Ukrainian children [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6059.0s)]
*  could amount to genocide. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6064.0s)]
*  What the Russians are doing [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6065.0s)]
*  is they're taking these kids from their parents [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6069.0s)]
*  and they go into these villages [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6072.0s)]
*  and they're shipping them into Russia and putting them up for adoption. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6074.0s)]
*  So the Ukrainian parents never change. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6080.0s)]
*  They're not going to change. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6083.0s)]
*  They're not going to change. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6085.0s)]
*  So the Ukrainian parents never see them again. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6087.0s)]
*  And the children never see their parents again. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6091.0s)]
*  Russia's abduction and deportation of thousands of Ukrainian children could amount to the crime of genocide, according to the special [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6094.0s)]
*  report for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in the European Parliamentary Assembly. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6101.0s)]
*  I don't know how anybody can tolerate this Russian government impudent. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6106.0s)]
*  And they claim to be MAGA and they claim to be Americans. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6110.0s)]
*  Since Russia's full scale invasion of Ukraine, [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6116.0s)]
*  February 2022, Russian forces have systematically [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6119.0s)]
*  abducted Ukrainian children, [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6124.0s)]
*  primarily in Russian occupied areas of Ukraine, [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6126.0s)]
*  taking them to Russia where they undergo reeducation [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6129.0s)]
*  and indoctrination. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6132.0s)]
*  It's not clear exactly how many children have been forcibly deported, many of whom were [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6135.0s)]
*  orphaned in the war, primarily because Russia's not sharing details on who it has taken and where they've gone. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6139.0s)]
*  In grains, government has confirmed that at least [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6145.0s)]
*  20,000 children have been kidnapped, though the total could be much, much higher. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6148.0s)]
*  Said Andrei Yermak, the head of the Office of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelenskyi. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6153.0s)]
*  Ukrainian children in Russia occupied territories are in jeopardy of facing the same fate without intervention. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6159.0s)]
*  The Ukrainian government has launched the Bring Kids Back Fund to raise awareness. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6165.0s)]
*  These are these are just monsters. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6174.0s)]
*  Monsters. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6179.0s)]
*  I mean, all these things that they're doing are against the rules of war, [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6183.0s)]
*  such as they are, but there are rules. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6188.0s)]
*  Stalin used to do the same thing with countries that he conquered. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6192.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't know how you sit face to face and interview a guy like this, [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6195.0s)]
*  and he thinks you're a patsy because you are. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6199.0s)]
*  I don't know how you defend a guy like this, [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6202.0s)]
*  assassinates people who sent over a million people to their death on both sides of this war for nothing. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6204.0s)]
*  Who is kidnapping children, [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6216.0s)]
*  bringing them into a war, [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6219.0s)]
*  who is kidnapping children, [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6221.0s)]
*  bringing them into Russia. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6224.0s)]
*  And people, people defend him. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6228.0s)]
*  They attack Zelenskyi. They attack Ukraine. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6231.0s)]
*  I don't I mean, I'll never understand it. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6233.0s)]
*  It's just crazy. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEELkOGfo1Q&t=6238.0s)]
