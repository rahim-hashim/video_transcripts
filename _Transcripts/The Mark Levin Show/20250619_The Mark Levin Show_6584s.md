Video Description: On Thursday’s Mark Levin Show, Iran's nuclear ambitions and ballistic missile development pose an existential threat to Israel and American civilization, which cannot be ignored. Israel, possibly with U.S. assistance, will take military action to neutralize this threat, as Iran will not go away on its own. Iran's actions, including attacks via proxies and American casualties, demand a decisive military response, which is self-defense rather than nation-building. These radical Democrats, fifth-columnists, and isolationists lack any strategy and moral clarity. Also, the people of Israel are never discussed by the media. They face severe challenges every day, especially in Tel Aviv, where ballistic missiles from Iran target hospitals and public areas, forcing families into bomb shelters. They are in constant fear with a disrupted quality of life. Media outlets ignore these struggles and ignore the regime’s history of killing and maiming American soldiers. Later, Zuhdi Jasser calls in and addresses the mindset of the isolationists and fifth columnists who deliberately ignore the existential threat posed by Iran’s theocratic regime and its proxies like Hezbollah and the Houthis. He emphasizes that these groups are driven by a radical theology that glorifies suicide bombing, chaos, and the targeting of non-combatants, with the ultimate goal of triggering an apocalyptic scenario tied to the return of the 12th Imam. Jasser asserts that Iran’s uranium enrichment is clearly aimed at developing nuclear weapons, not peaceful purposes, and warns that the regime would use such weapons, likening its leadership to a cult willing to commit national fratricide. Finally, Sayyid Qutb’s book Milestones, promotes pure Islam and strict shariah, rejecting Western values and most modern Muslims as ignorant (jahiliyyah). Groups like CAIR, ISNA, ICNA, MSA, and MPAC dismiss devout Muslims who oppose their views. Qutb’s ideas fuel sectarian violence and terrorism by groups like Hamas and al-Qaida, and states like Iran, which pursues nuclear weapons through deception (taqiyya). Western appeasement fails to counter this clash with democratic values.

# Mark Levin: Fighting Back Against Iran’s Nuclear Ambitions
**The Mark Levin Show:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs)
*  Ladies and gentlemen, this next segment of the podcast is brought to you by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=0.0s)]
*  For over 50 years, the Great Heritage Foundation has been America's outpost in Washington, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4.8s)]
*  fighting against the D.C. federal bureaucracy and working to secure a future that allows Americans [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=9.52s)]
*  to live the good life. For too long, common sense principles have been ignored by many of the very [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=14.64s)]
*  leaders claiming to fight for America, but the Heritage Foundation is proud to hold our leaders [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=19.28s)]
*  accountable and stand up for America's founding principles, paid for by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=23.6s)]
*  He's here. Now, broadcasting from the underground command post, deep in the bowels of a hidden [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=30.48s)]
*  bunker, somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=38.0s)]
*  we once again make contact with our leader, Mark LeVein. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  Hello America, Mark LeVein here, our number 877-381-3811, 877-381-3811. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=120.0s)]
*  You know, audience, this is going to be funny. Okay, reporters, turn on your recording devices. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=132.64s)]
*  See, the way it works here is whatever I say, they're going to try and [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=139.04s)]
*  create a fight between President Trump and me. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=143.12s)]
*  I promise President Trump and I already know this. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  The fact is, ladies and gentlemen, that whether it's two hours from now, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=153.84s)]
*  two days from now, or two weeks from now, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=158.0s)]
*  Iran's not going to go away on its own. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=162.56s)]
*  The Israelis are going to put it away by itself, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=166.96s)]
*  if they can, with that photo nuclear site. They'll put it away with our assistance, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=169.84s)]
*  at some point, I suppose, or it's not going to go away. It's not going to go away. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  That's the truth. You've got a combination of radical Democrats and fifth columnists, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=188.56s)]
*  isolationists in this country, who actually have no, and I repeat, no idea how to deal with this, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  except dig a hole and put your head in it and hope for the best. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=202.88s)]
*  If you don't take military action against Iran, then Iran exists. If you don't take military action [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=212.08s)]
*  against Iran, then they will increase their ballistic missile inventory to the tens of [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=219.76s)]
*  thousands. If you don't take military action against Tehran, they're going to have [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=225.2s)]
*  intercontinental ballistic missiles. If you don't take military action against Iran, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  they're going to have nuclear warheads. Combine that with their public statements, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=234.88s)]
*  and you have a death threat against the American civilization and of course, Israel. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=241.2s)]
*  Now, there's one lowlife out there who says Benjamin Netanyahu is the problem, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  that he's playing us. And so I guess that means he's playing Donald Trump. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=253.11999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump's not going to be played by anybody, and neither is Benjamin Netanyahu. It's about time [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=259.12s)]
*  these people will leave the country, and they're going to be playing Donald Trump. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=264.08s)]
*  It's about time these people with a low IQ and a small vocabulary try and grow up and act like adults. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=268.88s)]
*  But they won't. They're stuck. They've got their platforms, and that's the way it is. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=281.12s)]
*  Moreover, it is amazing to me that on an issue that is so clear between good and evil, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=288.48s)]
*  that they're having a problem with their own morality. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=295.2s)]
*  One of them is so busy walking a fine line that everybody's lost respect for him. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=298.88s)]
*  Another one has effectively thrown in with the enemy, rarely ever condemning [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=308.56s)]
*  the Islamo-Nazi who runs Iran. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=313.76s)]
*  And despite the polls that are out, whether it's CNN, whether it is the Reagan Institute, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=316.96000000000004s)]
*  all these major polls, although one site went to an online poll and tried to use that to support [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  their position, it just shows you they have nothing, nothing, nothing substantive, nothing. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=331.12s)]
*  No strategy, zero. And for them, everything is Afghanistan and Iraq. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=337.44000000000005s)]
*  Zero. And for them, everything is Afghanistan and Iraq. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=342.24s)]
*  They're ignoramuses. Everything is not Afghanistan and Iraq. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=346.16s)]
*  Everything is not nation building. This is called self-defense, peace, self-defense. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=349.84000000000003s)]
*  Iran struck Israel through its proxies. Iran has killed hundreds of Americans and maimed [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=361.04s)]
*  thousands. They have blood, American blood on their hands. Apparently, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=369.6s)]
*  apparently this doesn't move the fifth column of isolationists. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=375.28000000000003s)]
*  Apparently, the Democrats are okay with this. In fact, they use their deaths to say, what do [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=378.88s)]
*  we want, more deaths? As the very perpetrator of those deaths has been building nuclear weapons. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=384.0s)]
*  And they denied they were building nuclear weapons. And now Radcliffe, the head of the CIA, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=392.40000000000003s)]
*  says they're on the one yard line. It takes almost nothing for them to get a touchdown. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=396.8s)]
*  So we're supposed to disbelieve Radcliffe, disbelieve the IAEA, disbelieve the Austrians, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=401.76s)]
*  disbelieve everybody, but believe them. These are dangerous, no nothings. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=407.92s)]
*  Whether it's two weeks, next week, Saturday, Sunday, next Wednesday, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=418.48s)]
*  this problem doesn't go away. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=427.52000000000004s)]
*  So we'll negotiate another two weeks. With whom, I don't know. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=433.84000000000003s)]
*  The supreme Islam on Nazi, according to the press, we have all these quotes, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=441.04s)]
*  has told us to screw off. He's not interested. So I guess somebody else is going to negotiate. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=447.04s)]
*  I don't know who. I don't know who they represent. Could be interesting. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=453.12s)]
*  I don't know what kind of deal can be made. Unconditional surrender. What's to negotiate? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=464.72s)]
*  It's a three word surrender, Mr. Producer. We surrender unconditionally. Do you have to do a [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=474.24s)]
*  whole set of negotiations for that? Does that take two weeks? Does that take two minutes? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=481.12s)]
*  I'm only basing my comments on what I'm reading in the newspaper and online [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=490.48s)]
*  and what people are saying who are supposed to be in the know. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=497.92s)]
*  And what people are saying who are supposed to be in the know. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=501.12s)]
*  Meanwhile, during this two week period, ballistic missiles will continue to rain down on the [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=507.52000000000004s)]
*  Israeli people. Yesterday, last evening, actually, they aimed one of those missiles [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=512.88s)]
*  at a hospital. They said, oh, sorry, we were aiming at an intelligence facility. No, they weren't. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=518.64s)]
*  They aimed it at a hospital and they hit it. A direct hit. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=523.6s)]
*  This is a hospital, one of the biggest in southern Israel, that serves Muslims, Christians, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=529.6s)]
*  Jews, Bedouins and Arabs, Druze, anybody who comes through the door, anybody. And they hit it. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=537.28s)]
*  By the grace of God, the part of the hospital that was hit, by the grace of God, the part of the [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=548.16s)]
*  hospital that was hit, there was nobody there because they had moved the people out because [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=560.88s)]
*  they were doing work. That's God's will. What about the fact that Israel and the United States, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=568.64s)]
*  this is known, I'm not breaking any rules, are running out of interceptor missiles? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=580.56s)]
*  How much longer can that go on? How much longer can even a 90% or an 80% accuracy rate [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=586.08s)]
*  with a 10 to 20% inaccuracy rate go on? I noticed that the Democrats and the fifth column [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=594.48s)]
*  isolationists rarely ever talk about the suffering of the Israeli people, nor do they condemn [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=604.72s)]
*  condemn the supreme Islamist Nazi as much as they condemn Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=615.92s)]
*  It's shocking what's going on. Shocking. And the level of Jew hatred and anti-Semitism promoted by [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=627.6s)]
*  websites that continue to give voice to these individuals who represent a tiny percentage of [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=636.72s)]
*  the people, whether it's media, the Drudge Report or some of the others, is grotesque. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=642.72s)]
*  The people who go on on comment on that media platform and they own the platform [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=648.08s)]
*  sound like Klansmen and neo-Nazis. Just a disgrace what Dan Abrams has created over there. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=655.2s)]
*  A disgrace. And then when they write articles, they dip into the comments section and they [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=662.0s)]
*  trade pick comments that they feel will create the story that they're manufacturing. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=667.44s)]
*  And you wonder why people hate the press. The fact is that you and I stand with 84% [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=675.76s)]
*  of the Republicans. You and I stand with 80% of the American people. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=685.6800000000001s)]
*  Real surveys. Real polls. Not YouGov that's used by one of these websites to defend the indefensible. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=692.32s)]
*  Tell me where to go to find, and I'll put a link up, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=705.12s)]
*  tell me where to go to find the isolationist fifth column Democrat Party resolution [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=710.96s)]
*  to the Iran problem. You can't find it and not only that they don't think it's a problem. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=718.24s)]
*  That's why the American people reject them. Whether it's MAGA, the Tea Party, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=726.32s)]
*  the Reagan Revolution, all of us, the American people reject this. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=730.32s)]
*  So two weeks. People will have the greatest deal in the history of humankind. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=736.1600000000001s)]
*  But when two weeks are up, if we don't, will the fifth column isolationists, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=744.08s)]
*  will the Chatsworth Katarsens and Hisilk, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=750.6400000000001s)]
*  will they still oppose taking action? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=757.0400000000001s)]
*  And what makes the next two weeks so magical? What about the last three months? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=759.12s)]
*  The fact is the Iranian regime is on its back. It's hanging by its fingernails. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=767.28s)]
*  It's about to be eliminated. And so so successful have the Israelis been [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=775.52s)]
*  and let's not play games. The United States has provided some defensive support, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=780.8s)]
*  but those are Israelis going into Iran, attacking these locations. That was Israeli intelligence [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=783.84s)]
*  taking out the highest levels of their military, taking out the top senior nuclear scientists. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=790.08s)]
*  They're the ones who are going to be the ones who are going to be the ones who are going to be the [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=799.12s)]
*  top senior nuclear scientists. They're the ones who are prepared to take out Khomeini. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=804.0799999999999s)]
*  They're the ones going after the nuclear sites. They have no compunction about it all because [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=812.24s)]
*  they know that this is a battle between seventh century primitive barbarians, that regime, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=817.76s)]
*  and the free world and modernity and whether we survive or they survive. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=824.0799999999999s)]

*  No invasions, no nation building, no foreverness. POTUS decided, acted, succeeded, and was done with [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1113.28s)]

*  baby. I don't know how many more times you got to hear sink ships, and they're all over the place. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1596.4s)]
*  And it's the embeds. It's the isolationist embeds. It's the cokeheads or the Soros Marxists [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1601.1200000000001s)]
*  who have secreted themselves into this department or that department. They know who they are. Now, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1609.1200000000001s)]
*  who would leak? Who would leak to Chatsworth, Katarelson? You know, this investigation wouldn't [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1614.32s)]
*  take very long, would it? No, it wouldn't take very long at all. Maybe, maybe Chatsworth will just [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1623.28s)]
*  cough it up. They will just tell us. Maybe the guy at Axios, this guy, Ravid, maybe he'll just tell [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1632.48s)]
*  us. Why are these leaks always in one direction? Whenever the president makes a decision or they [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1644.08s)]
*  are concerned he's going to make a decision, that's on behalf of national security, our national [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1650.72s)]
*  security, in come the leaks. Oh my God, Trump and Netanyahu are at loggerheads. Netanyahu says that's [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1656.3999999999999s)]
*  not true. Trump says it's not true. Trump even puts out a social media site here. So who is it? [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1663.28s)]
*  Who is it that hates Israel? It's the fifth column isolationists. Oh no, no, no, Mark, you don't [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1671.12s)]
*  understand. They like Israel. They're just against war. Okay. So Israel's great. They just can't [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1679.9199999999998s)]
*  defend themselves. These people are stupid. Stupid. And the American people know it. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1686.1599999999999s)]
*  80% of the American people stand with you and me. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1697.1200000000001s)]

*  That means almost nobody stands with the reprobates. Despite them being promoted by Mediaite [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1705.68s)]
*  and Dan Abrams and Colby Hall, gutless wonder that he is, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1712.3200000000002s)]
*  and Charlie Nash. Boy, he's quite an investigative reporter. He writes a piece, then he goes in. He [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1719.68s)]
*  looks at who's making comments. Oh, look at this. The conservatives are upset. Five morons, one of [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1726.8s)]
*  whom works for Matt Gaetz. Is there a bigger sleazeball than Matt Gaetz? Yeah, there is actually. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1731.92s)]
*  There's a lot of them. But nonetheless, while the conservative movement is working for the [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1738.88s)]
*  Republicans, they don't care if they get Nazis and neo-Nazis and Klansmen in there. And they own [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1745.52s)]
*  the site. You know, I don't own X and all these other sites. They own that site and they get [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1758.08s)]
*  revenue based on the number of people who have eyes on it. They don't care if these people wear [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1764.72s)]
*  white robes. They don't care. And so this is why they do what they do. This is why [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1770.72s)]
*  Colby Hall, who runs the operation, is a gutless wonder, wouldn't come on this program. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1776.32s)]
*  I wanted to have a discussion with him about the mission of this company. I wanted to have a [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1780.72s)]
*  discussion with him about a whole host of things. First, he said yes, then he said no. I'm not going [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1784.56s)]
*  to be subjected to insults. Mr. Producer goes back and says, Mark says, none of that's going to happen. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1789.6799999999998s)]
*  It's going to be very professional. Well, professional's in the eye of a hole. So he's a weasel. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1794.48s)]
*  They hide behind their laptops, probably without pants. Probably haven't shod for seven days. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1800.24s)]
*  Right? Probably eating pretzels and you know, you understand. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1811.1999999999998s)]
*  They don't want to be questioned. I mean, I was going to be perfectly seriously polite because [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1819.6799999999998s)]
*  that site is very diabolical. It reminds me of Media Matters. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1826.48s)]
*  And they're getting the clicks that they want, apparently. So if you're a neo-Nazi or a Klansman [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1832.16s)]
*  or whatever you are, you're welcome over there at MediEight. Your comments are very much welcome. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1837.44s)]

*  That in addition to all this, a lot of foreign governments are involved trying to influence [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1850.0s)]
*  decision making. And guess what? They don't like Israel. Guess what? They like Iran. So when you [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1853.76s)]
*  go on the Internet, the Internet, there's a lot of good that comes out of it. But it's also a toilet [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1858.8799999999999s)]
*  bowl for human turds. It's also a toilet bowl. And it's been penetrated by a lot of foreign [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1864.72s)]
*  governments. There's a report out on this. I think I saw online. I think I'd link to it. Iran, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1874.16s)]

*  fulfill his mandate. The Heritage Foundation has been analyzing the situation and they've been able [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1910.16s)]

*  So for two weeks the people of Israel are going to have ballistic missiles raining down on them [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1976.8s)]
*  because the islamic nazi regime is targeting the citizens, Tel Aviv in particular, hospitals, [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1981.04s)]
*  and other places. The sirens going off, the endless runs, the bomb shelters, and public garages, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1986.32s)]
*  and so forth and so on. Imagine being a mother or father trying to raise a little kid there. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=1996.32s)]
*  This is the whole country. Imagine. Now watch these people on TV, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2001.52s)]
*  they go that's two weeks, it's strategic, it's this or that. That never comes into the discussion. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2010.0s)]
*  The quality of life, what's being done over there. It's not only survival, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2016.8s)]
*  but it's the quality of life. It's a democracy. It's the only one. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2023.36s)]
*  These missiles are flying in for the purpose of doing the most damage possible. Meantime [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2028.72s)]
*  the restraint shown by the Israelis not hitting population centers, desperately trying to avoid [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2033.2s)]
*  them. There's no discussion about this. It's as if the lives of these people don't even matter [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2038.32s)]
*  to the media. When's the last time they discussed it at MediEye or the Drudge Report [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2047.28s)]
*  or Politico or Axios? They never discuss it. Now making these comments, they're all listening in [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2054.0s)]
*  on this program, are they going to mention what I'm saying here about that? [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2060.3199999999997s)]
*  And keep something in mind, the fifth column isolationists, they don't give a damn about the [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2068.8s)]
*  Israelis' lives at all. Well we support Israel, but there is no but. You don't even care about [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2074.4s)]
*  our lives. You don't even care about the fact that this regime killed hundreds of American soldiers, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2080.6400000000003s)]
*  killed them. Mained thousands of American soldiers through their proxies and directly, through IEDs. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2085.6800000000003s)]
*  Never comes up in their discussion, ever. They've got three bumper stickers and that's it. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2094.88s)]
*  Then they claim to be patriotic. They're not patriotic. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2103.1200000000003s)]
*  They claim to represent America. Many of them are un-American. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2108.5600000000004s)]
*  Their instincts are wrong. Their belief systems don't make sense. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2112.7200000000003s)]
*  They're not MAGA. Make America Great Again. MAGA is against them. They're fake MAGA. They're not [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2115.76s)]
*  pro-Trump. They turned to them. They stabbed them in the back the first chance they got. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2132.7200000000003s)]
*  First chance they got. And in two weeks if Trump decides [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2137.0400000000004s)]
*  to send the bombers with the bunker busters, they'll attack him again. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2141.2s)]
*  Not just an honest difference of opinion. He's complicit in war. Isn't that what [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2149.04s)]
*  Katarlson said? Something like that? He's doing the bidding of the Jews in Netanyahu who's being [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2155.3599999999997s)]

*  Again, this is my friend. This is somebody I and my wife's friend, our family's friend, [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2168.72s)]
*  man I admire. And the right decisions will be made. Many of them have been made. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2175.9199999999996s)]
*  He's still playing them out. I have my own opinions. I've voiced them. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2184.3199999999997s)]
*  I have voiced them. No surprises here or there. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2190.9599999999996s)]
*  There is no MAGA division when it comes to Iran. I told you that a week or two ago when I was [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2199.04s)]
*  responding to this reprobate, Colby Hall's piece. Look at the divisions of MAGA. They want a division [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2205.3599999999997s)]
*  in MAGA, meaning they want to undermine Trump. There are no divisions in MAGA. MAGA, the vast [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2211.2799999999997s)]
*  majority of the Republican Party, the vast majority of conservatives, the vast majority of [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2217.9199999999996s)]
*  independents, even Democrats, back Donald Trump on this issue. They want that nuclear site gone. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2222.48s)]
*  Should he decide to listen to the other side, then they won't back him on that issue. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2232.56s)]
*  But ultimately, in my view, he's not going to. He's drawing the red line. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2237.44s)]
*  He's drawing the red line. Let me help the Iranian Nazis. They run that regime. It's three words. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2244.32s)]
*  You can put it down, put it in Farsi. We'll find an interpreter. We surrender unconditionally. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2250.2400000000002s)]
*  That's it. You don't need two weeks to write that. You only need two minutes to write that. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2256.08s)]
*  So where is it? Will it be forthcoming? I would like to know. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2262.0s)]
*  Where is it? We shall see. And we're also going to keep an eye on if there is a deal, exactly what is this deal. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2270.08s)]
*  But we'll see. Things will play out as they play out. Next up, we have our friend Zoudi Jasser. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2278.3199999999997s)]
*  He's a top reformer. Top reformer, creating a movement in the Muslim movement, up against the Islamists, the fundamentalists. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2284.3199999999997s)]
*  Which is a very dangerous thing. He's a man of deep faith. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2294.32s)]
*  But he also understands that other people have deep faith, too, and they're allowed to do that. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2302.32s)]
*  They're allowed to have that. They're allowed to exercise. That's right. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2309.28s)]
*  In the mindset of the Islamo-Nazi regime in Iran, we want to pursue that. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2314.0800000000004s)]
*  Because clearly, the low IQ mindset of the fifth column isolationists have no idea. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2318.88s)]
*  No idea. They just burp up their bumper stickers. We'll be right back. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2326.32s)]

*  Hello America. Mark Levin here. Our number 877-381-3811. 877-381-3811. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2369.8399999999997s)]
*  By Adam Loews. Let's see. Just bear with me. Bear with me. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2379.8399999999997s)]
*  Many of your favorite anonymous MAGA accounts are run by foreigners with connections to Pakistan, [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2393.2799999999997s)]
*  Iran, China, Russia, and so forth. He points out warfare isn't just kinetic. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2398.64s)]
*  The battlefield extends to information. The information. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2404.72s)]
*  And there's some evidence and examples of what he's talking about. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2410.24s)]
*  A lot of that is true. A lot of that is trolling. You can tell because a lot of it is repetitive [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2414.8799999999997s)]
*  and really quite grotesque. And so you have to believe that some of that is that. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2421.6s)]
*  Then we have this. We have the audio, Mr. Producer of Caroline Levitt talking about [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2429.3599999999997s)]
*  Iran has all it needs to achieve a nuclear weapon. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2439.04s)]
*  Let's hit it. Cut five, go. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2444.0s)]
*  When the president said a few weeks away, did he mean obtaining enough enriched uranium [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2445.7599999999998s)]
*  to start building a weapon or did he mean Iran is a few weeks away from completing the production [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2453.12s)]
*  of a weapon? I'm glad you asked that, Weijia. It's an important question and it's one, frankly, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2460.16s)]
*  the media has been getting wrong. Let's be very clear. Iran has all that it needs to achieve a [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2464.4s)]
*  nuclear weapon. All they need is a decision from the Supreme Leader to do that. And it would take [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2470.08s)]
*  a couple of weeks to complete the production of that weapon, which would of course pose an [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2475.12s)]
*  existential threat, not just to Israel, but to the United States and to the entire world. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2479.76s)]
*  And that is something that the entire world, including countries like Russia, is in agreement [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2484.5600000000004s)]
*  with that Iran should not and cannot obtain a nuclear weapon. And that's why the president [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2489.2000000000003s)]
*  believes that. And he's believed that again, not just his political career, but frankly, [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2493.76s)]
*  his entire life. The only problem is Russia has provided them with ground air missiles to prevent [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2498.0800000000004s)]
*  the only country so far, the only country so far that is actually targeting and trying to take out [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2503.28s)]
*  their nuclear sites. And that would be the little country of Israel. Let's be clear about that. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2508.72s)]
*  Nobody else has lifted a finger so far. That's number one. Number two, I agree with her and [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2514.16s)]
*  she's brilliant. And she's repeating basically what our intelligence services have told her, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2520.48s)]
*  Radcliffe, the CIA. That is all they need is a decision from the Supreme Leader. But that's [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2525.9199999999996s)]
*  an argument for taking out the Supreme Leader. He's in his 80s. He's dug in and he's a mass murder. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2532.96s)]
*  It's also a reason why when they talk about a decision within two weeks, [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2541.2s)]
*  the sooner the decision is made, the better. I mean, again, if the position is that the so-called [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2545.28s)]
*  Supreme Leader has to give the order and they will have a nuclear weapon, achieve a nuclear weapon, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2552.7200000000003s)]
*  in two weeks or so, then he's got to go and the program's got to go. No, Mr. Perdue, [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2560.08s)]
*  am I missing something? I don't think so. And so what do the isolationists have to say about this? [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2569.2799999999997s)]
*  What's the fifth column have to say about this? Nothing. They go on the attack. They don't [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2575.68s)]
*  provide substance. They don't provide arguments. They fear monger and they're wrong all the time. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2583.52s)]
*  They just are. That's why the American people really want nothing to do with them. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2591.76s)]
*  That's why Donald Trump really wants nothing to do with them, quite frankly. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2597.92s)]
*  That's why I certainly want nothing to do with them. They're a danger [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2602.2400000000002s)]
*  to my country, my family, our country, your family. That's the truth. So you heard it there from the [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2606.4s)]
*  spokeswoman for the President of the United States. You've heard it from the CIA director. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2615.84s)]
*  Now, what did you hear from Tulsi Gabbard in March? I was the first one to point this [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2619.44s)]
*  contradiction out. The very first one that what she said was not true. And she said it under oath. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2623.1200000000003s)]
*  And she ought to be held to account. No, I don't mean thrown in prison and all that. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2630.7200000000003s)]
*  She ought to make herself available so questions can be raised, at least by Republicans in the [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2636.2400000000002s)]
*  Senate. What were you talking about? What information were you looking at? When we have the [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2641.36s)]
*  White House officially telling us that all they need is a signal from the supreme Nazi. And in [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2646.7200000000003s)]
*  two weeks, they have a nuclear weapon. And by the way, Politico, why did you lie? [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2653.92s)]
*  Why did you lie with Katarelson? The Independent, why did you lie with Katarelson? [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2658.56s)]
*  Mediaite, why did you lie with Katarelson? Why did you all lie? Because you like it. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2664.4s)]
*  The facts don't matter. Got to get those headlines in the hyper headlines. You can get all the [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2672.48s)]
*  neo-Nazis commenting, you get all your little hits. Cowards. That's who they are. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2676.88s)]
*  All right. We have, let's see here. I want to pull up. Bear with me, folks. I don't have a [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2683.04s)]
*  printer working here. I'm trying, Mr. Producer. Here we are. Perfect. Netanyahu with reporters today. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2691.68s)]
*  These men like each other a lot, Netanyahu and Donald Trump. I happen to know that for a fact. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2703.04s)]
*  They like each other a lot, despite the best efforts to try and come between them. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2707.84s)]
*  Cut to go. President Trump will do what's best for America. I trust his judgment. He's a tremendous [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2713.2799999999997s)]
*  friend, a tremendous world leader, a tremendous friend of Israel and the Jewish people. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2720.4s)]
*  And we will do what we have to do. And we are doing it. We are committed to destroying [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2724.8s)]
*  the nuclear threat, the threat of a nuclear annihilation against Israel. We're able to do it. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2729.7599999999998s)]
*  And we, of course, will make our own determination. But I have to say that the partnership with the [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2737.2s)]
*  United States, the partnership with President Trump, with whom I speak to almost every day, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2741.92s)]
*  is incredible. I think his resolve, his determination and his clarity when he says Iran [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2747.44s)]
*  cannot have a nuclear weapon and for that to take place, Iran cannot enrich uranium. It's as simple [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2754.2400000000002s)]
*  as that. He gave them the chance to do it through negotiations. They strung them along. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2762.08s)]
*  And you don't string along Donald Trump. He knows the game. And I think that we're both committed [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2767.68s)]
*  to making sure that Iran will not have a nuclear weapon and they won't. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2775.2799999999997s)]
*  That's a decision for the president to make, but I can tell you that they're already helping a lot [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2784.4s)]
*  because they're participating in the protection of the skies over Israel and its cities with [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2789.7599999999998s)]
*  TAD missiles, batteries that are in Israel, with Aegis ships that are on the shore of Israel, [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2795.6s)]
*  with our pilots that are fighting alongside our pilots to knock out drones. I think it's a [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2801.36s)]
*  remarkable cooperation. So the idea that these two men are separated is so outrageous and these [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2806.72s)]
*  leaks keep coming out to Axios and others because the people leading it are this fifth column [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2813.6s)]
*  isolationist crowd, the Charles Cokeheads, the Soros Commies, the embeds, the isolationist embeds. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2820.32s)]
*  That's who they are. Netanyahu further at the hospital, which was a direct hit by the [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2829.04s)]
*  Iranians and their ballisticness, we were hating the intelligence site or military say, [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2837.1200000000003s)]
*  Israeli say that's not accurate. They knew exactly what they were doing. Cut three, go. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2841.1200000000003s)]
*  Do you see this kind of? I think it says everything about Israel and about Iran. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2850.8s)]
*  Israel is fighting to remove the nuclear missile threat aimed at our annihilation. We're targeting [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2857.76s)]
*  military sites. We're targeting nuclear sites. We're targeting missile sites. They're targeting [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2864.4s)]
*  a hospital. In this hospital, there are patients who are immobile. They can't even move. Right next [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2870.56s)]
*  to it is a children's ward, a baby's ward, infants. They target it. They can give this nonsense that [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2876.0s)]
*  they're targeting military sites. What military sites? I know all the military sites in Israel. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2882.72s)]
*  There isn't a military site here for miles and miles around. They're targeting civilians because [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2888.0s)]
*  they're a criminal regime. They're the arch terrorists of the world. They want to have nuclear [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2893.12s)]
*  terrorism, which will put the entire world under nuclear blackmail and they would use these weapons. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2898.0s)]
*  That's what the Atollah al-Hamenai says that he would do. He would use these weapons to wipe Israel [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2902.88s)]
*  off the map. Well, he's not going to. We're not going to let him. And we're in the process of [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2907.6800000000003s)]
*  achieving a tremendous victory. And our victory is aimed at those two goals. People ask me, [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2911.76s)]
*  are we targeting the downfall of the regime? That may be a result, but it's up to the Iranian people [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2916.56s)]
*  to rise for their freedom. Freedom is never cheap. It's never free. Freedom requires [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2923.28s)]
*  freedom. Freedom requires these subjugated people to rise up and it's up to them. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2930.48s)]
*  But we may create conditions that will help them do it. Our goal is twofold. Nuclear ballistic missile. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2935.44s)]
*  We're going to remove that. We are in the process of completing the removing this threat. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2942.32s)]
*  Wow. What a radical trying to drag us into a war. You notice he's not trying to drag us into anything. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2947.92s)]
*  He's making the point, we'll do it if we have to alone. Obviously, it would be better. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2956.0s)]
*  I'm just commenting if we could help them a little bit with that one site. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2960.24s)]
*  I mean, folks, the air is owned by the Israelis. There's no, [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2966.0s)]
*  essentially no, if not completely no ground to air defense system. It's completely open. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2971.68s)]
*  So I'm not even sure what the downside is. You know, they talk about all these missiles will be [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2978.64s)]
*  shot at our, at our armed forces. If you listen to how these, these reprobates argue, it's, [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2985.04s)]
*  it's going to be World War Three. No, the Arab countries are going to join in. They haven't. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2994.08s)]
*  Let's see what else. Oh, all these missiles will be shot at our, let me ask you something. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=2999.92s)]
*  If the head of Iran is taken out, in my view, if this remaining nuclear site and the others are [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=3004.48s)]
*  crushed and destroyed, who's going to shoot what? What? Not unless they want to be blown to King [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=3011.28s)]
*  Nikam too by the Israelis, the United States together or separately. How many missiles have [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=3020.32s)]
*  come into Israel from Hezbollah since this one also? I mean, I'm not even sure. I'm not sure. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=3026.64s)]
*  Hezbollah since this went on, not one. How many from Hamas? I think two. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=3033.04s)]
*  How many from the Houthis? I think one or two. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=3040.08s)]
*  You get my drift, Mr. Producer. You do that. You're going to be annihilated. We'll be right back. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=3044.8s)]

*  Exactly. We're sitting in a moment in history that our children's children will look back and say, [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=3819.12s)]
*  this was a tipping point towards good in the planet, not towards evil, towards good. And [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=3823.52s)]
*  ultimately, that's why I don't even like the term regime change, because we're not putting in another [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=3828.72s)]
*  regime. This is destruction of an evil regime that will allow, just like in Syria, they tried a decade [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=3832.9599999999996s)]

*  they did what it needed to protect themselves. But that was what broke the back so that the [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=3844.7999999999997s)]
*  deep state and Assad's regime no longer existed. And right now, if a side benefit of Israel [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=3850.0s)]

*  will there be some chaos? Sure. But that is still far preferable for humanity than a fratricidal [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=3875.7599999999998s)]
*  regime that would want to destroy the Middle East and it's tribal millennial battles that it's had [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=3882.72s)]
*  since the 11th century. You make an important point. What could possibly replace this regime [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=3889.3599999999997s)]
*  that would be worse? Nothing. And I can tell you that a lot of us, I have a clarity coalition. I [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=3894.48s)]
*  would ask people to go to claritycoalition.org. It stands for Champions for Liberty Against the [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=3900.8799999999997s)]

*  just believe in God, don't believe in God that came together that are dissidents from Iran, [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=3914.64s)]
*  across the world, from Europe and Canada and the US. We all almost unanimously agree that this is [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=3919.36s)]
*  a gift to humanity that's happening and we're bipartisan. There are Democrats, Republicans, [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=3925.68s)]
*  conservatives, liberals. The narrative that this is somehow a narrow conservative idea [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=3930.32s)]
*  to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon is beyond ignorant. It's just complete propaganda. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=3936.88s)]
*  What do you say to people who say, actually, the Israelis are dragging us into a war? See, [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=3943.52s)]
*  your voice and the voices of the people you see and speak with, which is enormous, it's never heard. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=3948.8s)]
*  You don't get a platform if I don't put you on. You're not heard by the so-called new media. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=3955.04s)]
*  You're not heard by most cable channels. You're certainly not heard by networks. I don't think [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=3960.24s)]

*  isn't there? Exactly. There are millions of us that believe in the American form of government, [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=3969.3599999999997s)]
*  Western form of free speech, of liberty, of separation of mosque and state. But we not [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=3976.4799999999996s)]

*  youth, not only Muslims, but leftists and this red-green axis. And ultimately, the future of [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=3987.6s)]
*  humanity depends on recognizing that we can no longer live a lie that somehow we're not at war. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=3993.12s)]
*  Iran tells us every day, the Khomein, is that we are at war. They want to kill us. They want death [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=3999.8399999999997s)]
*  to America, death to Israel. That is a war stance, a war footing that they've had. They're attacking [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4004.4s)]
*  Americans, contrary to the Islamist agent Ilhan Omar's words on Congress. They're attacking us [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4010.24s)]
*  on our ships from the Houthis. They attacked Israel on October 7th through Hamas and it's [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4016.56s)]
*  funded by Iran. They're attacking us through spies. Our dissidents, Masih Anidia was targeted for [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4021.6s)]
*  assassination. She's one of our coalitionist and liberal Muslim thinkers. She was targeted in New [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4028.08s)]
*  York for assassination and she's one of thousands that are targeted on our soil because Iran wants [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4034.24s)]
*  to insulate themselves from reform and modernity. I'm just concerned that some of these people who [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4040.32s)]
*  are lobbying the White House and out there with their little followers and everything, [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4047.28s)]
*  the information that you're providing is very, very important to all the American people. It's [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4054.0800000000004s)]
*  very important that people understand the mindset. This is not a Western mindset. It's not even a [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4058.48s)]
*  Marxist mindset. It's not even a fascist mindset. It is, as you call it, a death cult. And so they [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4062.8s)]
*  will negotiate anything, which they've done. They will sign anything, which they've done. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4069.36s)]
*  And they have absolutely no intention of complying with it. And that they believe, as you've pointed [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4074.4s)]
*  out, Zudy Jasser and I have in my book as well, that they believe is there, it's required of them, [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4080.4s)]
*  right? Absolutely. They see it as a mandate. They see themselves. And this is the beauty of [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4088.08s)]
*  the American system, of our Western legal system. The theocrats see themselves as God. They see [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4093.6s)]
*  their representation in government as being God. They don't see themselves as regular human beings. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4099.68s)]
*  So anything goes. And listen, I'm a doctor and I love humanity. I take care of my patients. And [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4104.64s)]
*  that's the most important thing. I don't want to see fighting or war, but at the end of the day, [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4110.4s)]
*  you want the least killing possible. And preemptive strikes are far more ethical and far more moral [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4114.8s)]
*  than allowing some massive conflagration that could have obviously been prevented. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4122.0s)]
*  That's why we take defense courses. That's why we have a Department of Defense, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4126.4s)]
*  because you ultimately to prevent war, sometimes that's the most peaceful method is to prevent [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4130.24s)]
*  bullies, global death cult fish bullies from being able to get a nuclear weapon and threaten us. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4136.72s)]
*  And I wish my friend Bernard Lewis was still alive. He wrote one of the greatest books, [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4143.76s)]
*  The Jews of Islam and talks about the flourishing of Jewish thoughts at one time in Islam when there [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4148.56s)]
*  used to be thousands of schools of Islamic thought. And now there's basically three across the planet. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4156.08s)]
*  And that's it. And this is a new and could be the beginning, the first step in could be some chaos, [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4161.360000000001s)]
*  but ultimately, the first step towards modernity, which is making sure theocrats like the Iranian [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4168.16s)]
*  regime do not have the means to lock their population in with a nuclear weapon. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4173.76s)]
*  Your point's a good one. We're not talking about establishing a democracy, you know, [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4178.56s)]
*  democracy or no democracy. The point is eliminating this hell. You eliminate this hell. There's many [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4182.8s)]
*  opportunities that open up. I hear people have very limited knowledge of history. Basically, [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4188.400000000001s)]
*  they look at recent experience again with Afghanistan and Iraq. Everything is not Afghanistan and Iraq. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4193.360000000001s)]
*  And the Persian people in particular, the Persian people are not used to this kind of theocracy. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4199.360000000001s)]
*  That's not what they're used to. These people, you know, for the most part, they were they were [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4205.04s)]
*  capitalists. For the most part, they they were professionals or well educated, even if they [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4210.0s)]
*  didn't go to colleges and so forth. They weren't third worlders, were they? They weren't. And, [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4214.72s)]
*  and you know, listen, the evolution needs to be big. You need to be given their space. There were [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4221.4400000000005s)]
*  many mistakes in Iraq and Afghanistan. And certainly, it is not our role to build nations. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4226.56s)]
*  They should build themselves. And many of us have learned many lessons of what happened in Iraq and [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4231.68s)]
*  Afghanistan. But it's very different. Syria, there's no doubt I've got family there. There's [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4237.200000000001s)]
*  no doubt they have a jihadi regime, jihadis in suits running their their country right now. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4241.84s)]
*  But they're going through the same evolution. Iran had a had a royal family, had a Shah. They [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4246.88s)]
*  went away from that monarchy to say, Oh, let's try Islamism. And now after 50 years, 46 years of that, [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4252.24s)]
*  they're realizing they will never go back to that or their monarchy. And that's part of the normal, [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4260.0s)]
*  the West went through the same evolution through monarchies, and then theocracy, and then now, [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4265.12s)]
*  obviously, liberal democracies. And this is the same type of evolution that as long as they [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4271.2s)]
*  faced with their own internal threats, their populations can deal with it and will go through [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4276.8s)]
*  multiple revolutions. But when they have external threats, we have a duty as Israel not only to [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4281.44s)]
*  protect itself, but the world benefits from making sure that bullies global bullies don't have nuclear [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4287.04s)]
*  weapons to take us all with them. We're going to be reaching out to you again to come on Sunday. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4294.08s)]

*  very important, particularly now. People keep talking about diplomacy and negotiation. I'm not [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4302.96s)]

*  hell they're talking about. They don't know what the hell we're up against. And then they just keep [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4316.24s)]
*  throwing out bromides like, Well, what about Iraq? And what about Afghanistan and forever? [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4320.0s)]
*  Whereas I'm going, My God, how stupid are these people? All right, Zudy Jasser, thank you, brother, [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4323.76s)]

*  Now you understand. It is a problem. Is there I think in the end, [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4359.2s)]
*  I could be wrong. Okay, so let's put that marker up there. There's not going to be a deal because [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4366.639999999999s)]
*  the Islamist Nazis, even though they're diabolical and so forth, I don't think they're going to want [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4371.76s)]

*  center. And to be getting into other things that are not as relevant would be kind of foolish. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4499.04s)]

*  Have you ever heard of [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4590.4s)]
*  of Syed Ketub? Q-U-T-B. Of course you haven't. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4591.6s)]
*  He's one of the most prominent thought leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood and Political Islam. Now [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4602.4800000000005s)]
*  he's dead, of course. But he wrote a book in 1965, which is, may I say like their holy Bible. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4607.68s)]
*  He lived for a period of time, by the way, in the United States. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4617.04s)]
*  And he was disgusted by the freedom. He was disgusted by the free will. He was disgusted by [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4622.56s)]
*  the prosperity and the plentiful shelves and all the rest. Actually his book was written in 1964. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4628.96s)]
*  It's called Milestones. Milestones. And this is what so many people who are decision makers [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4634.4800000000005s)]
*  just don't comprehend. Here's what he wrote. And this is on page 51 of my new book on power. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4645.36s)]
*  Ketub often mentions, which I was discussing with Zudi, Jahiya, which he defines as the state of [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4656.0s)]
*  ignorance, of the guidance of God. What is extremely significant about this is that in [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4664.08s)]
*  Ketub's view the entire Western world was riddled with Jahiya. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4671.68s)]
*  At the same time he considered most Muslims of his time to be suffering from such ignorance [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4682.88s)]
*  due to what he considered by watering down through the ages of pure Islam. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4690.400000000001s)]
*  And mostly because of Western influences, by the way. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4698.320000000001s)]
*  And he said this must no longer exist. And so the West has to go. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4702.4800000000005s)]
*  Things like democracy have to go. Capitalism have to go. It all has to go. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4707.12s)]
*  He saw it as his mission to revive this pure Islam. It's a phrase that Zudi's made famous, [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4712.56s)]
*  with its very strict interpretation of Sharia law and they never give an inch in terms of adopting [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4719.92s)]
*  or compromising with Western values, which he considered devoted to materialism, violence, [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4727.2s)]
*  and racism. You can see why there's a fusion. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4734.4s)]
*  You can see why there's a fusion between Marxism and Islamism. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4742.8s)]
*  And Jasser notes our foremost objective is to change the practices of this society. That is his. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4749.84s)]
*  So the constant bloody wars among different Muslim sects, including in Syria, Yemen, Lebanon, [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4758.08s)]
*  and elsewhere. The targeting of the West by a long list of Islamist organizations, Hamas, [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4765.28s)]
*  Islamic Jihad, Al-Qaeda, so forth. And Islamist states that support terrorism like Iran and Qatar. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4772.0s)]
*  They provide evidence, ample evidence, of the bloody Islamist impact, both within individual [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4779.4400000000005s)]
*  countries and throughout the world, on Muslims and non-Muslims alike. So this jihad, I guarantee [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4788.16s)]
*  you there's not a single person, isolationist, any of these people, who know what the hell I'm [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4797.4400000000005s)]
*  talking about. And Western societies and governments do not seem to comprehend or wish [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4806.8s)]
*  to deceive themselves into ignoring, rationalizing, or excusing the dire peril Islamism presents, [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4813.360000000001s)]
*  despite multiple acts of terrorism committed against them and threats of more, this is my book [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4821.6s)]
*  again, worse to come. Some cases Western governments hope to avoid the consequences of Islamist ideology [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4827.2s)]
*  through appeasement, negotiation, or financial arrangements. This is very important. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4834.4s)]
*  As of this writing, Iran, an Islamist dictatorship, so I finished this book, what, two months ago? [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4844.16s)]
*  Two and a half months ago, so let's see how close I was. Ready? As of this writing, Iran, [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4851.679999999999s)]
*  an Islamist dictatorship that has spread terrorism and murder throughout the Middle East and beyond, [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4856.5599999999995s)]
*  repeatedly demands the annihilation of the United States and the Jewish state of Israel, [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4862.0s)]
*  and has fired hundreds of missiles into Israel, has attempted to assassinate the president of [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4866.799999999999s)]
*  the United States, has killed and maimed American soldiers and citizens, and has made alliance with [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4872.719999999999s)]
*  the communist Chinese government, is hell-bent on completing the development of nuclear weapons [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4878.719999999999s)]
*  and intercontinental ballistic missiles and their delivery systems. Despite multiple agreements [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4884.08s)]
*  with the West and assurances that it has no intent on building nuclear weapons, the Islamist regime [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4891.04s)]
*  is about to have what is called a nuclear breakout, that is nuclear weapons. Iran has lied, cheated, [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4898.72s)]
*  and deceived multiple American administrations, international organizations, European countries, [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4907.5199999999995s)]
*  etc., on its path to a nuclear breakout. Yet the United States and the West still hope to reach [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4916.0s)]
*  another deal to prevent Iran from crossing the finish line, and Iran will oblige them at some point. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4922.4s)]
*  As long as the Islamist regime survives, so too will its nuclear ambitions despite any paper [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4929.92s)]
*  agreement or short respite. That's pretty prescient, don't you think, Mr. Producer? [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4936.96s)]
*  That's in my new book on power. There is no clear example of the clash between negative and positive power. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4940.48s)]
*  This book is on power. You're going to find, I know, look, we know each other. You're going to find it fascinating. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4950.24s)]
*  That negative and positive power between a terrorist Islamist dictatorship in Western democracies, [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4959.04s)]
*  with a mindset, principles, and goals could not be more different, indeed, in addition [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4965.280000000001s)]
*  to what has already been said, deception or an Arabic. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4971.76s)]
*  I don't want my glasses. Hold on here. Ready? Of course, my Arabic is very fluent. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4976.240000000001s)]
*  Taqiya. Taqiyya. Taqiyya is believed to be legitimate, if not necessary, [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4983.12s)]
*  if not necessary strategy against non-Muslims. Now, what is this? Taqiyya. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4991.44s)]
*  Raymond Ibrahim explains, according to Sharia's, the body of legal rulings that defines how a [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=4999.2s)]
*  Muslim should behave in all circumstances. Deception is not only permitted in certain [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5005.2s)]
*  circumstances, but may be deemed obligatory in others. Obligatory. Deception. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5011.28s)]
*  Now, we talked to our friend Zudi about the other word, the word Jahiya. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5020.48s)]
*  And now we're talking about the word for deception. So deception is the name of the game. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5026.56s)]
*  Deceit, lying, where we would think it's immoral. That is part of the faith belief system if the [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5036.88s)]
*  goal is to preserve the faith. In this case, a terrorist regime. That's why they keep lying [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5046.080000000001s)]
*  and all the rest of it. Now, by the time you're done reading this book, you're going to know more [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5053.68s)]
*  about this than anybody else. Anybody. And this is one of the reasons I'm so excited about. This is [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5060.240000000001s)]
*  just one little piece of the book. You're going to know more about Alexander Hamilton than anybody. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5067.04s)]
*  I've taken a different view of him after a tremendous amount of research on this man. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5072.72s)]
*  I don't think you're going to like him as much as you like Jefferson and Madison and Franklin and [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5079.4400000000005s)]
*  these guys. And you'll see why. It has nothing to do with personal life. It has to do with his [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5083.2s)]
*  viewpoint and how he approached things. You've seen this famous play or heard about it. Hamilton, [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5089.679999999999s)]
*  right? All the liberals and Democrats love this play. I don't even know if it's still playing, [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5095.84s)]
*  but it was playing for the longest time. And they all would fight over tickets, get the best seats. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5100.639999999999s)]
*  It's the real happening. And so there's a reason for that. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5106.56s)]
*  I'm not saying Hamilton is like a Bernie Sanders type, [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5111.76s)]
*  but Jefferson and Madison, Jefferson, the first author, the declaration, Madison, considered the [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5116.240000000001s)]
*  father of the Constitution. They despised Hamilton, even though Madison, Hamilton and John Jay, but [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5121.76s)]
*  mostly Hamilton and Madison wrote the Federalist Papers and argued for the Constitution. And this [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5129.52s)]
*  is what drove Madison crazy about Hamilton. He advocates for a Constitution. And then later, [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5135.28s)]
*  he advocates for centralized power and a reinterpretation of phrases. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5142.0s)]
*  I just told you something you don't know, but you're going to know a hell of a lot [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5150.719999999999s)]
*  more when you're done with this book, a hell of a lot more. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5153.5199999999995s)]
*  You're going to learn more about Marxism and why that matters in this country. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5159.2s)]
*  Since basically Marxism is the fallback ideology, Americanized Marxism, for the left and the [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5163.52s)]
*  Democrats. We're going to explore further. You'll take the journey with me on this fusion that I [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5170.24s)]
*  talk about between Marxism and Islamism. We're going to talk about the declaration. Where does [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5176.4800000000005s)]
*  this thing come from? Really? Let's get to the root of the matter. We have some people, friends, [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5183.12s)]
*  who say, Hey, look, the founding principles are right out of the Bible, the Torah in specific. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5188.56s)]
*  They're right about that. But I have a little quibble. That's where they're found. But also, [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5194.320000000001s)]
*  what are the founders site? The Enlightenment. They cite Locke, they cite Montesquieu, [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5203.84s)]
*  they cite others. And so I explained there, it's a fusion between faith [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5209.200000000001s)]
*  and the Enlightenment. The problem with Islam is it's a fusion between faith and coercion and tyranny. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5213.36s)]
*  I talk about the book, authoritarian democracy, a phrase I think I invented. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5223.679999999999s)]
*  I certainly didn't take it from anybody else. Just seemed like the right phrase, authoritarian [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5231.599999999999s)]
*  democracy, which is what the Democrat Party promotes. More authoritarian than democracy. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5235.44s)]
*  Remember, we're a constitutional republic. They promote authoritarian democracy. We get into that [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5243.04s)]
*  in the book. And I think you're gonna find that fascinating. And what is this negative power and [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5249.6s)]
*  this positive power? What is this soft negative power? What do these things mean? These are terms [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5254.88s)]
*  that I've developed and coined for application to make the discussion of power easier. Why do I give [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5262.32s)]
*  a damn about power? Maybe you don't, but you're living in the middle of it. With your family, [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5268.56s)]
*  with work, there's no avoiding it. You may not notice it, but if you start to think about it, [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5273.6s)]
*  you'll notice that it's everywhere. But I don't write books about psychology and psychiatry, [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5281.4400000000005s)]
*  because I'm not either of those. This book applies in the context of community, society, government. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5286.64s)]
*  And the determination of power determines whether you're free or enslaved or some combination of [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5294.56s)]
*  both. And so we get into this, we, I get into this deeply. And I'm very excited about it. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5298.72s)]
*  And I hope you'll pre-order your copy over there at amazon.com. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5309.84s)]
*  Many of you probably feel I'm going to, but I'm waiting. I wouldn't wait. I'd get it. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5316.88s)]
*  Probably feel I'm going to, but I'm waiting. I wouldn't wait. I'd get in line. I'd go ahead [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5321.36s)]
*  and get it. Get the discount. The discount will grow over time. Depending. Here's why I keep urging [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5325.599999999999s)]
*  you to do this now. The more people pre-order, the greater the discount. That's the secret with [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5330.96s)]
*  Amazon. So at 11% discount, if just four, five, six, seven thousand of you pre-order the book today, [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5336.719999999999s)]
*  that discount will increase significantly. And it will apply to the book that you're pre-ordering. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5345.759999999999s)]
*  And the book that everybody else has pre-ordered. And that's the way it works right up to the point [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5350.96s)]
*  of release on July 29th. So if thousands of people in this audience were to go ahead and [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5355.28s)]
*  pre-order the book on Amazon, if you're going to get the book, the sooner you do it, the better, [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5361.36s)]
*  because the accumulation of sales increases the discount. Am I making it clear, Mr. Bidiff? I hope [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5367.28s)]
*  so. That's what we've done over the years. And that's what I want to accomplish this year. So [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5373.92s)]
*  the first thing I've done is I had the publisher make sure the book was priced right. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5379.84s)]
*  Now what I'm saying is, if you focus on Amazon sales and you do it now, [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5386.24s)]
*  you and all the other patrons in this audience will be able to bring the discount down [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5392.96s)]
*  significantly more, lowering the price for you and each other. It's a great idea. I'll be right back. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5397.92s)]
*  Ah, yes. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5409.84s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, Michael Patrick Leahy [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5423.360000000001s)]
*  has a fantastic group of local newspapers, especially in Tennessee. He's breaking a story [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5428.08s)]
*  here. New York law firm representative Kilmar Abrego Garcia. Remember that guy? [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5436.48s)]
*  Remember him? Trafficking in human beings. Oh, no, no, no. He's a man from Maryland. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5442.24s)]
*  Remember that? Wife abuse on multiple occasions. Oh, yeah. Member of MS 13. Member of the Democrats. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5450.08s)]
*  He received $7 million from Reid Hoffman. Remember this? Left-wing a-hole billionaire. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5460.4s)]
*  His nonprofit. The same guy who funded E. Jean Carroll. Remember those lawsuits she brought [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5466.0s)]
*  against Donald Trump? Remember that? This guy Reid Hoffman. He's like a mini George Soros. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5471.92s)]
*  What a pig. That's right, pal. You're a pig. That's right. And I say that with all due respect. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5482.5599999999995s)]
*  So his firm that funded Carroll case against 47 is funding the Abrego defense case. Isn't that sick? [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5488.96s)]
*  Yeah, he's a sick bastard. I'm sorry. I don't like using that word sick, but nonetheless, [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5498.16s)]
*  from time to time, I have to use it. And I will certainly use it against him. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5503.04s)]
*  Let's see here, Mr. Producer. Do we have any callers? I've got to... We do. I just need to [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5510.24s)]
*  get to my email here. Got these little hiccups, folks. I apologize. It's nothing to do with [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5516.08s)]
*  technology. Yes, it does. I can't get the printer work. What do you mean, Mark? Okay, here we are. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5522.16s)]
*  Elon, Pearl River, New York. How are you, sir? Hey, what's going on? Let me look. Nothing. Yeah. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5527.84s)]
*  Hello? Yes, sir. Go right ahead. What's going on? I just had a quick question. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5537.28s)]
*  Yeah. What's up? What's going on? Tucker Carlson. I'm sorry. You mean Chatsworth [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5542.56s)]
*  Katarelson? No, just like Tucker Carlson. He's going up all... All right, let's get rid of this. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5556.56s)]
*  I'm not going to... I don't even know what he's going to say. I don't want to spend shows talking [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5562.160000000001s)]
*  about Tucker Carlson. He wanted to talk about Israel. Did he not, Mr. Producer? [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5565.4400000000005s)]
*  No. You get by us. I'm going to just slap you down. That's it. And you know why I'm not going to do [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5569.52s)]
*  that? Because while I will continue to do it, I don't think callers should participate in that. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5576.64s)]
*  I really don't. He attacked me, so I'm dealing with him. Maybe one day I'll let the floodgates [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5586.400000000001s)]
*  open. He should know that the vast majority of the listeners and callers to this program hate his [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5593.92s)]
*  guts. And he's not the only one they can't stand. But I'm not going to bring up the other names. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5599.28s)]
*  Not yet. Vito Homoso, Florida, WXJB. How are you? I'm doing good, Mark. How are you? I'm all right. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5605.92s)]
*  Thank you. All right, Mark. Hey, thanks for taking my call. And hey, Mark, you know, congratulations [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5616.0s)]
*  on your book about power. And I hope it gets to my little town of home, Assa, because, well, [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5623.36s)]
*  well, I really want to look, I'm in the NFL, so I don't have computers or TV. Right. All that radio [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5628.719999999999s)]
*  and your telephone. But yes, I'm very interested in it, because you've been speaking about it for [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5635.2s)]
*  a while. But I wish I had one to send you. I don't have them. Anyway, go ahead. No, that's I know you [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5640.639999999999s)]
*  don't. I get it. I know they're coming soon to a theater near us. But Mark, I want to talk to you, [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5646.0s)]
*  I have to hold you over. And we're gonna have to get to the point. Don't hang up. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5653.36s)]
*  Just because I have this break. We'll be right back. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5658.4s)]
*  They can clone the others, but there's only one. Mark, put in and you can call it. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5664.16s)]
*  And it's 7 7 3 8 1 3 8 1 1. Hey, it's really good to be with you. Yes. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5670.08s)]
*  Yes. South Philadelphia, Mr. Producer. How you doing? Okay. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5676.16s)]
*  Let's take a callers. Let me see here. Good idea. Back to veto in Florida. Veto go right ahead. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5685.5199999999995s)]
*  Sorry. Hey, Mark. No, that's all right. Mark, I was a little worried. Our president that we love [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5694.639999999999s)]
*  and share with. He has this new two week delay here. I'm kind of concerned about the GOP division [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5703.44s)]
*  there. In this two week delay, I'm a little worried about that that gives Iran too much chance to, [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5713.28s)]
*  you know, they're able to produce something, you know, doesn't give them two more weeks to [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5719.92s)]
*  stay in the mountain and build. You know, Veto, you make a great point. I'm not a fan of this [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5724.96s)]
*  for several reasons. Number one, they're going to keep shooting missiles into Israel, [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5728.88s)]
*  into their hospitals. They're targeting these population centers. Unlike the Israelis are [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5733.84s)]
*  trying to go after military centers and nuclear sites. So those people are going to suffer over [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5738.0s)]
*  there. And nobody seems to give a damn on TV and media, I on radio. They talk about it as if it's [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5743.28s)]
*  a baseball game. Well, what will happen here and what will happen later? I mean, this is real life [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5749.52s)]
*  for these people. Number two, they've been under siege by Iran and its proxies now for almost two [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5754.16s)]
*  years straight. That has an effect on a society and a people, a very negative effect. And number [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5759.92s)]
*  three, those people don't want to just exist. They want to enjoy their lives. And so this Iranian [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5767.44s)]
*  regime is a seventh century, primitive, barbaric regime trying to get its hands on 21st century [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5773.84s)]
*  weaponry. We had Zoudi Jasser who explained it. Well, my book does too, which is people don't [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5781.2s)]
*  understand the mindset. They don't they don't want nuclear weapons to threaten us. They want [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5786.08s)]
*  nuclear weapons to destroy us. This is what they say God compels them to do. This is what they say [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5791.44s)]
*  the Quran compels them to do. You have Zoudi Jasser, who is a Muslim reformer. He's screaming at the [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5798.0s)]
*  top of his lungs, figuratively and saying, Hey, everybody, you better start paying attention to [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5804.16s)]
*  this. And so one of the things they do is what they're doing. Delay, delay, distract, distract, [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5808.32s)]
*  lie, cheat. And for them, God compels them to do that in order to advance their ideology. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5815.44s)]
*  And so you're right on. I don't think they should get another minute. But look, [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5823.92s)]
*  the president is the president. I trust him. He is good judgment. And in the end, I think, [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5827.28s)]
*  I think that's what's going to take place. He is under a lot of effort, but a lot a lot of [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5832.72s)]
*  is under a campaign by these fifth column isolationists like Katarlsen and Hizilk [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5838.32s)]
*  to basically do nothing. And now you have them complaining that Israel is dragging us into a [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5845.28s)]
*  war. May I ask you something, Vito, who is fighting this war primarily? Isn't it the Israelis? [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5850.32s)]
*  Well, the Israelis. OK, see, the problem is the Israelis are the chosen people. Nobody can respect [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5856.24s)]
*  or understand that. And bless you for being Jewish, Mark, because you are a gifted person, [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5861.44s)]
*  because you have that gift as well. You are one of the chosen people. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5866.96s)]
*  But I'm deeply hated by a lot of people for my faith. And this is coming out now. Deeply hated. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5871.919999999999s)]
*  I mean, I'm shocked. And you should see the comments and you can see the media like media [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5879.759999999999s)]
*  playing into this with their headlines because they want the clicks and everything else, you know, [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5886.5599999999995s)]
*  it's really it's stunning to me. Am a red blooded American. I've always been. I speak out about what [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5891.44s)]
*  I believe. If the Chinese attack Taiwan, wait until you hear me about that and so forth and so on. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5898.08s)]
*  Very consistent and very principled because of my faith, because of my beliefs. And most Americans [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5903.2s)]
*  are because of the Judeo-Christian belief system. And you're pointing to the Bible and you're right. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5910.24s)]
*  By the way, Vito, what do you see in the Bible? Don't you see forever wars, good versus evil [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5915.2s)]
*  against the devil? OK, so OK, so right now this is a possibility of being Ezekiel's war, [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5920.08s)]
*  but it is definitely not the end of wars. And I know, you know, look, I have all the books, Mark, [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5926.08s)]
*  just like you have. OK, so I do a lot of reading because I'm an integral. But so this is the [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5932.32s)]
*  possibility of the Ezekiel's war as far as the Persians coming. OK, which they are Babylon and [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5938.4s)]
*  the Persians. OK, which is the destruction of the Israelites, which is totally wrong, totally focused. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5944.64s)]
*  And look, I love every Jewish person. I believe in the Israelites and everybody hates them because [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5951.92s)]
*  they are the gifted, blessed people of the world that have the only religion that has proven fact [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5957.360000000001s)]
*  in the great books of ancient time, which I hold in my house. I'll tell you what's interesting, Vito. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5965.68s)]
*  The Babylonians couldn't destroy them. The Persians couldn't destroy them. I'm not even [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5974.64s)]
*  going to name them all. The Romans couldn't destroy them. I mean, horrific, horrific genocide. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5979.92s)]
*  Hitler couldn't destroy them. And there they are in the Middle East fighting again, fighting again, [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5989.200000000001s)]
*  these terrorists, these Iranians. And to be honest with you, if Biden hadn't bridled them, [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=5995.4400000000005s)]
*  and in some ways we bridle them now, you can't take out the leader and so this would be over already. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6001.2s)]
*  It would be over. They have defeated the Iranian military. Think about it, despite all the rest of [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6006.5599999999995s)]
*  it, trying to get the nukes sites and so forth. They literally have defeated the Iranian military [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6011.679999999999s)]
*  in 48 hours. 48 hours. And I think even President Trump is stunned by the genius of what they've [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6017.36s)]
*  done here. And what you're saying is that's because there's God's hand. And a lot of evangelical [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6028.96s)]
*  Christians believe in this too, because they understand what the Bible says about Judaism [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6034.88s)]
*  and about the Messiah and about God and so forth. Jews understand it too. Vito, you are a great [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6040.64s)]
*  caller. Make sure you call again. I really enjoyed that. Terrific. Let's keep going, shall we? [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6046.8s)]
*  Let's see. Let's go to Doc Wurminster, Pennsylvania. I know exactly where it is. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6052.8s)]
*  I'm on the Mark Levin app. How are you? Good, Mark. Thank you for taking my call. Yeah, we [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6059.84s)]
*  grew up less than 10 miles apart. Amazing. I'm right around your age too. I'm 66. Yeah. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6065.92s)]
*  I spent a lot of time down around, you know, Glenside area and- [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6073.12s)]
*  Elkins Park, Glenside, yep. Elkins Park. Yeah, my friend lived right next to Rizzo's Pizza on [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6076.88s)]
*  Glenside. Oh my God. It's not there anymore, but it was great. It was great. Yes, yes. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6081.52s)]
*  Look how you remember all this stuff. Cool, very cool. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Trip down memory lane. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6089.04s)]
*  But I- At least we have our memories to take the trip. And anyway, go right ahead. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6095.360000000001s)]
*  At least we have our memories to take the trip. And anyway, go right ahead. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6101.12s)]
*  Bear with me. I'm a retired carpenter. I'm not a smooth talking preppy. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6107.68s)]
*  Sound pretty good to me. Do you wear a bow tie? [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6112.8s)]
*  No, I was never wear bow ties. I guess when I was a kid, maybe mom put one on. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6118.400000000001s)]
*  Exactly. One of those clip-ons. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6122.56s)]
*  Yes, yes. But yeah, I- I paid for the sake of argument that Iran wasn't [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6124.24s)]
*  close to developing a nuke. Go back to October 7th, okay? And clearly, Iran has their thumb on [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6132.96s)]
*  all this- everything that goes on in that area. You know, that in itself is justification for [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6142.88s)]
*  Israel to wipe the crap out of this Iranian regime. And I really don't hear that emphasized. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6149.28s)]
*  It don't seem like- like it seems to me like on October 8th, Israel should have been doing [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6156.8s)]
*  then what they're doing now. You know, that was justification. And how about the three- [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6162.8s)]
*  You're so right. You're so right. You're so right. And that's why [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6168.72s)]
*  80% of the American people agree with you and me and not the reprobates. And that includes [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6173.36s)]
*  84% of Republicans. And then I see 90% of MAGA thinks that we ought to go in there and take [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6179.679999999999s)]
*  these nuclear sites out if the Israelis can't. Sure. Well, I mean, that's a bonus, you know, [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6185.679999999999s)]
*  to take out the nukes. But just- just a justification- You're right. Use the word I use myself. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6193.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6200.320000000001s)]
*  And how about the three- the three soldiers we lost in that area back under Biden's regime? [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6202.64s)]
*  You're right. Head injuries. Yeah. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6210.64s)]
*  They shot that into Iraq. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6214.64s)]
*  No. No, but has anybody paid the price for 603 of our soldiers murdered by these- these bastards? [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6217.04s)]
*  Thousands of wounded. You see Tunnel for Towers, wounded warriors, the other? [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6224.400000000001s)]
*  A lot of this in Afghanistan and Iraq was done by these bastards. Or how about the- the Towers? [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6229.92s)]
*  The- excuse me, the two embassies that were taken out in Africa. People forget about that. These [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6236.96s)]
*  subhumans have American blood on their hands and they've never paid a friggin' price for it. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6244.96s)]
*  And it's the Israelis that are kicking their ass. It's the Israelis that destroyed Hezbollah. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6254.08s)]
*  It's the Israelis that have stepped up this tiny little country with a few million people. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6260.32s)]
*  And I gotta sit here. I've gotta sit here and listen as Doc does, as Vito does, as Elon does. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6267.28s)]
*  All of us sit here and listen to- well, should we bomb the nuclear site or not? [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6275.6s)]
*  When the skies are clear, because they've taken out all their defense systems [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6282.24s)]
*  from these damnable isolationist fifth columnists in our country. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6289.12s)]
*  Do I have that about right, Doc? [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6293.679999999999s)]
*  Bingo. You nailed it, Mark. You know, has Tucker Carlson ever been- has he ever addressed that? [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6297.28s)]
*  Has he ever been asked about that? [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6305.36s)]
*  Oh, who the hell knows? Be honest with you. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6306.16s)]
*  I- I never paid attention to him until he decided to get in my face. And that was his mistake. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6308.56s)]
*  And it will be the mistake of his for the next 20 years. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6315.12s)]
*  I am a Doberman. I don't let go. And I'm not going to let go. And I now realize what a danger he [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6319.360000000001s)]
*  and his cabal of isolationist fifth columnists are. And he's not alone. He's not alone. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6326.88s)]
*  Doc, I want to thank you, brother. Great call. Warminster, Pennsylvania, right? [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6334.4800000000005s)]
*  Near where I grew up. And Doc was great. All you callers are great, actually. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6338.56s)]
*  I have to take a little break. We'll be right back. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6344.64s)]
*  Mark LeBun. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6346.959999999999s)]
*  You know, in this audience, this vast audience, every corner of the country, [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6359.44s)]
*  in many corners of the world, this audience despises [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6364.959999999999s)]
*  us. Chatworth Katarlson. Have you noticed Mr. Producer? [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6370.08s)]
*  We have to keep the callers off the air who want to talk about him. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6376.32s)]
*  They- such a tremendous honor. All righty. I'm pulling up the call screen. We've had a loaded [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6382.16s)]
*  board all night, haven't we? Yes, we have, Mark. Todd Oakwood, Illinois, the great WLS. How are you, Todd? [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6389.6s)]
*  Mark, it is an honor and a privilege to speak to you. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6398.56s)]
*  Oh, that's very kind. Thank you, brother. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6405.52s)]
*  I am a U.S. Army combat medic infantry man. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6409.52s)]
*  Wow. God bless you. Thank you. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6416.56s)]
*  Well, and now I'm a nurse. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6419.6s)]
*  So what scares me about our entire situation is we have got- [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6424.56s)]
*  Sounds like you're in a car wash or something. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6434.24s)]
*  No, sorry. I'm in my garage. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6437.6s)]
*  Okay. Put it right up to your mouth, the mouthpiece, and then we can hear you better. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6441.04s)]
*  Okay. We have got to take on Iran. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6444.8s)]
*  I mean, Israel's beating the crap out of them. I mean, seriously, [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6452.08s)]
*  we can't help with the skies cleared with one of our B-52s and one of our bunker busters. I mean, [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6458.08s)]
*  you heard Netanyahu. He says, we'll do it with our bare fingers if we have to. We're going to [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6465.280000000001s)]
*  get it done one way or another, but it just seems so unreasonable that the great powers, [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6468.64s)]
*  not just the United States, are thinking about it, measuring it, and so forth and so on. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6476.08s)]
*  You do feel great about our Commander-in-Chief because I know he does the right thing and he [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6484.88s)]
*  will do the right thing, and he may have information we don't have. He said in less than two weeks, [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6488.72s)]
*  I am a little concerned about the fifth column isolationists. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6493.92s)]
*  We voted for Donald Trump. We didn't vote for the people around him. We voted for him. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6498.56s)]
*  And that is a very important point to always remember. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6504.88s)]
*  All right, Todd. By the way, thank you again for your service. God bless you, brother. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6509.76s)]
*  Let's keep going, shall we? Marie, Central Oregon, the Mark Levin app. Go right ahead, please. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6514.4s)]
*  Hi, Mark. I am so honored to be a first-time caller. Thank you. I'm looking for you all the time. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6520.8s)]
*  I've never been anti-Jewish or Israel, but you have opened my eyes to so much. I am just [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6528.0s)]
*  majorly for Israel, and they definitely need our help. Being for Israel is being for America, [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6536.72s)]
*  and being for America is being for Israel. I explain this all the time. The Judeo-Christian [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6544.16s)]
*  ethic, that's what founded our nation. That comes right out of the Holy Land, Judaism and [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6548.56s)]
*  Christianity. Was there a fast point you want to make? The music's coming. I was listening. I was [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6553.84s)]
*  listening for your book. I went and ordered it right then and there, and it's up to 30% off. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6559.92s)]
*  30% off, folks. Go grab it at amazon.com. Marie, thank you. I told you, we do this together. It [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6566.8s)]
*  goes up the discount. We salute all you heroes out there. We'll be here tomorrow, [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFbk2CbKXs&t=6572.72s)]
