Video Description: On Wednesday’s Mark Levin Show, Iran, and isolationist ideologies are major threats. DNI Tulsi Gabbard’s stance on nuclear war and her revisionism about the U.S. defeating Imperial Japan under Harry Truman are grotesque. Gabbard, the Quincy Institute, and people like Chatsworth Qatarlson (Tucker Carlson) are emboldening Iran’s regime by signaling American weakness.  Despite the fake news, Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons, and moral clarity is demanded against the Islamo-Nazi regime in Tehran. Prudent, fact-driven foreign policy is essential, with a commitment to hold misleading media and ideologues accountable. Later, the media ignored the funding behind the L.A. riots by Marxists and Islamists while promoting revolutionary rhetoric from protesters claiming indigenous rights and advocating socialism. Immigration should prioritize American citizens, not illegal immigrants. Also, a federal judge in Newark, New Jersey, appointed by Joe Biden, ruled that the Trump administration cannot detain Mahmoud Khalil. Khalil is not a student but a Hamas supporter who violated his immigration status by promoting a terrorist organization’s agenda and engaging in efforts to undermine the U.S. and attack Jews.

# Mark Levin: Defending America Against Ideological Fools
**The Mark Levin Show:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ)
*  Ladies and gentlemen, this next segment of the podcast is brought to you by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=0.0s)]
*  For over 50 years, the Great Heritage Foundation has been America's outpost in Washington, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4.8s)]
*  fighting against the D.C. federal bureaucracy and working to secure a future that allows Americans [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=9.52s)]
*  to live the good life. For too long, common sense principles have been ignored by many of the very [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=14.64s)]
*  leaders claiming to fight for America, but the Heritage Foundation is proud to hold our leaders [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=19.28s)]
*  accountable and stand up for America's founding principles, paid for by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=23.6s)]
*  He's here. Now, broadcasting from the underground command post, deep in the bowels of a hidden [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=30.48s)]
*  bunker, somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=38.0s)]
*  we once again make contact with our leader, Mark LeVein. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  Hello America, Mark LeVein here, our number 877-381-3811, 877-381-3811. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=120.0s)]
*  The police aren't our enemy, the rioters are. The National Guard's not our enemy, the rioters are. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=133.92s)]
*  The active duty military's not our enemy, the rioters are. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=142.88s)]
*  Conservatives aren't our enemy, Iran is. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=146.24s)]
*  Japan attacked us and many other countries, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=151.68s)]
*  and we ended the war to ensure it wasn't forever war. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=157.52s)]
*  And yet, Tulsi Gabbard is concerned about nuclear war, except apparently when it comes to Iran. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=164.72000000000003s)]
*  As she's one of the most radical of the isolationists. I'd given her the benefit of the doubt, but I can't anymore, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=172.48s)]
*  and I with that video that she put out, basically blaming the greatest generation, Harry Truman, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=179.44s)]
*  for destroying Imperial Japan, that regime. It's really grotesque, you can look all over social media, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=188.72s)]
*  people are disgusted with this, but if that's the mindset going in, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=196.96s)]
*  that's like one of the other clowns who basically said that Neville Chamberlain [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=202.16000000000003s)]
*  was a man of peace and Churchill was the warmonger. These are seriously ill ideologues. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=206.96s)]
*  Seriously ill. And no matter how many stories you read, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=216.24s)]
*  the personal attacks, or the truly stupid arguments they make, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=221.2s)]
*  the arguments that no, Iran's not building nukes, you know, they're a very pleasant society out there. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=225.44s)]
*  I'm not going to step back from these people, they're fools. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=234.24s)]
*  If we go to war with Iran, it's going to be the result of the war. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=239.04s)]
*  They're fools. If we go to war with Iran, it's going to be the result of Chatsworth [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=243.92s)]
*  Cattarleson, the Quincy Institute with the Charles Cokeheads, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=254.32s)]
*  the other isolationists, apologists, appeasers, because they are giving [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=263.59999999999997s)]
*  the bloodthirsty terrorist, assassinating regime in Tehran, the impression, the impression [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=270.71999999999997s)]
*  that America is weak, that Americans don't mind if they get the bomb, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=281.52s)]
*  that it's just conservatives, neocons, warmongers who object. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=286.56s)]
*  Now this view is supported by America's Islamists. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=293.68s)]
*  What's that fat slobs name on that show, the Turkish one, the turkeys, what is that show, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=297.52s)]
*  Young Turks? What is that jerk's name? I don't even know. But others too. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=302.32s)]
*  It is they who will get us into a war. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=311.6s)]
*  Yeah, doesn't matter. I don't even know these people. Who the hell even follows them? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=315.84000000000003s)]
*  No, I don't. I have no connections to Qatar. None. I have no connections to Qatar-supporting [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=321.84s)]
*  individuals. None. I don't kiss Putin's ass. I mean, think about this, America. Something very [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=332.79999999999995s)]
*  strange is going on, something very dangerous, something very weird. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=341.44s)]
*  It's not about warmongers and so forth. You either side with the United States or you side with Iran. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=345.20000000000005s)]
*  Either you side with good or you side with evil. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=352.32s)]
*  Either it's okay for this Islamo-Nazi regime to have a nuclear weapon that keeps threatening us [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=356.48s)]
*  and threatening to blow up, to blow the state of Israel to face the earth as well as the world. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=362.72s)]
*  Or it's okay for the world to be in a state of war. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=367.20000000000005s)]
*  It's okay for the world to be in a state of war. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=370.56s)]
*  That's either okay or it's not. Moral clarity. That's what it's about. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=376.56s)]
*  Moral clarity. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=384.32s)]
*  As for the reports in Mediaite, in Politico, in the Bestiality, and so do the other [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=388.32s)]
*  entrails of phony media, that Iran is not developing a nuclear weapon, we shall see. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=398.96s)]
*  We shall see who's right about that. I look at the evidence. That's what I do. I look at facts. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=406.88s)]
*  I read the legitimate sources. I have no insider knowledge. Neither do they. It's public. It's [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=414.08s)]
*  available to anybody who is quasi-literate. They had a cent-com as a liar. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=421.28s)]
*  Pete Hagsteth testified today that Iran is seeking a nuclear weapon. Well, is he right or is Gabbard [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=428.96s)]
*  right? I'm just curious. It's obvious that the Trump administration, except for a few [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=434.47999999999996s)]
*  of these isolationist embeds, is very concerned about Iran creating a nuclear weapon. Not because [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=443.76s)]
*  I had lunch with the president. That doesn't change a thing. It's because it's happening right in front [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=453.12s)]
*  of your eyes. Right in front of your eyes. And the media outlets that are doing the bidding, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=463.12s)]
*  doing the bidding of the liars and the reprobates, I will hold them to account right here. I will [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=476.24s)]
*  remind America over and over again that rather than telling the truth and providing news, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=484.56s)]
*  they chose to do otherwise. The American people need the facts, not ideologues, not propaganda. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=493.12s)]
*  They need the facts from responsible people, not ideologues. Foreign policy is about prudence. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=502.24s)]
*  That's what it's about. It's about prudence. You can throw whatever wrenches you want at me, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=511.84000000000003s)]
*  shoot whatever spitballs you want, this little cabal. There's more to come and I will push back [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=521.6s)]
*  even harder. It won't matter. I've spent my life defending this country, the Constitution, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=526.16s)]
*  supporting conservative causes, constitutional causes. I haven't had 25 different philosophical [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=537.6800000000001s)]
*  views. That's a lot. I wasn't a neocon and then call other people neocons. That's bizarre. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=546.08s)]
*  So here we are. If you're a veteran, if you're in the military, I urge you to take a look at [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=558.1600000000001s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard's video. It's all over the internet. I urge you to take a look at it [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=569.9200000000001s)]
*  because she speaks for this cabal. I urge you on your own to take a look at the evidence [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=576.96s)]
*  that is everywhere on whether or not Iran is building a nuclear weapon. Take a look. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=583.44s)]
*  Look, that's not Marx's false information. Responsible media outlets are reporting this. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=590.96s)]
*  People in the know are talking about this. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=602.96s)]
*  Patriotic men and women in the military and intelligence services are banging the pots [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=608.72s)]
*  and pans. I'm reading to you what they say. I'm not making it up. You know, this reminds me of [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=615.04s)]
*  March 2017. When I came behind this microphone and I laid out exhibit after exhibit after exhibit [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=622.8s)]
*  of how they were trying to take down Donald Trump, how the FBI was leaking, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=632.7199999999999s)]
*  how they used FISA against him, and we came under withering attack. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=638.16s)]
*  But I was right. The media were reporting these things. I didn't bring up wiretaps first. The [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=645.52s)]
*  New York Times did, and then they changed their headlines. I didn't bring up FOIA first. One of [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=652.48s)]
*  the other news outlets did, and then I read it, and I put it all together for you behind this [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=657.52s)]
*  microphone, and then for Pete Hegseth on Sunday's Fox and Friends, and then for Sean Hannity on [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=664.48s)]
*  Monday's Hannity. The media lied about that. The media were spreading propaganda fed to them by [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=674.0s)]
*  the FBI, the Democrats, and other media. Same thing is happening right now. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=685.2800000000001s)]
*  The sources I use for the information I tell you, and we also provide it on my website, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=690.32s)]
*  and it sits there. How long, Mr. Producer? Four years? About four years for you to check on your [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=695.6s)]
*  own. We don't shoot from the hip. I don't leak either. Somebody in the White House, perhaps in [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=703.2s)]
*  the VP's office, leaked to Chadsworth-Katarlson. Absolutely dishonorable. They don't know what I [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=712.48s)]
*  said or didn't say. The people in the meeting and the President do. There was no drumbeat for war [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=718.72s)]
*  against Iran. They don't know what I said or didn't say. The people in the meeting and the [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=726.5600000000001s)]
*  President do. There was no drumbeat for war against Iran. They don't know what I said or [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=733.84s)]
*  against Iran. It was a sober discussion. But I don't come here and tell you I spoke to the [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=740.48s)]
*  President and here's what I discussed. That's dishonorable. But people who weren't there, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=748.0s)]
*  who received leaks, perhaps from friends and relatives, they seem to think everything [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=755.28s)]
*  went a certain way and they discussed it as if they were there. They weren't there. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=762.8000000000001s)]
*  I've explained this over and over again. Why? Because they're desperate. Because they don't [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=766.96s)]
*  support America. Because they're okay if Iran gets a nuclear weapon. They're lying about the evidence. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=774.32s)]
*  They're lying about their progress and they're attacking anybody who dares to raise it. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=781.2s)]
*  Whether they be Tom Cotton or Ted Cruz or other people. Whether they be honorable. Honorable. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=786.64s)]
*  Honorable. Men and women patriots, many of whom have fought for this country. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=793.92s)]
*  They're thugs. So they attack. They leak. They plant stories. It's not going to work. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=801.04s)]
*  It's not going to work. Chatsworth Katarelson said in another burp of incoherence, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=811.68s)]
*  I'm old. My views are old. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=824.24s)]
*  You know what, ladies and gentlemen? I'm actually not old. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=829.04s)]
*  I'm actually pretty young in my 60s. You know what's old? The Constitution. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=834.9599999999999s)]
*  That's old. There's all kinds of people who are old, older than I, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=843.52s)]
*  President of the United States. He's fantastic. Outstanding. The fact of the matter is, it's not [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=848.4s)]
*  about age, is it? And yet this is how they argue. This is how they conduct themselves. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=857.92s)]
*  These people are morons. They're thugs. They're trying to prevent you from speaking out. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=867.12s)]
*  I want to encourage you, those of you who love this country, those of you who are fearful of [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=874.3199999999999s)]
*  Iran getting a nuclear weapon and threatening the United States of America, those of you who [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=880.3199999999999s)]

*  He's absolutely not. But he's not a fool. He's not an ideologue. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=971.12s)]

*  racist. And anybody can quote me on that. They take things out of context because context matters. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1106.4s)]
*  But when you run an aggregator site like that, like Drudge and so forth, and you pick and choose, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1114.0800000000002s)]

*  877-381-3811. You know, my monologue, I think it was on Sunday, the days start to meld together, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1208.56s)]
*  was about Thomas Jefferson and John Adams. And I did an explanation of that here on the radio [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1221.84s)]
*  program as well, about how these two men became fast friends, then how they they turned against [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1228.6399999999999s)]
*  each other in very brutal ways. And then for 12 years they wouldn't speak to each other. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1238.32s)]
*  And Adams reached out at the urging of Dr. Benjamin Rush, another delegate [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1247.76s)]
*  in the past to the Constitutional Convention. And he wrote a short note to Jefferson, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1258.48s)]
*  and Jefferson happily embraced it. And I discussed this story, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1264.56s)]
*  and the president watches my shows. Apparently must those two, I hope so, as millions of people do. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1272.1599999999999s)]
*  And so we have this piece in USA Today, and this came out just about an hour ago. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1281.04s)]
*  Elon Musk called Donald Trump before expressing regret for harsh attacks. And my suggestion at [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1287.52s)]
*  the end of the program, Mr. Producer, was that Elon Musk pick up the phone, call Donald Trump, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1294.24s)]
*  and really make amends, because he started it. And no, I didn't tell Donald Trump about it. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1300.56s)]
*  Elon Musk reached out and talked privately to President Donald Trump by phone before [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1308.0s)]
*  the billionaire entrepreneur and former White House advisor expressed regret publicly [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1312.08s)]
*  for his harsh personal attacks on the president. So here's another leak out of the White House, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1316.64s)]
*  by the way. But Reuters confirmed the June 10 evening phone call, citing a White House source [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1321.52s)]
*  with knowledge of the matter, after the New York Times first reported the exchange. Marked the [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1327.2s)]
*  first time the Tesla and SpaceX CEO and Trump have spoken since their lines shattered during [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1332.4s)]
*  an epic feud last week. At least it didn't last 12 years, right, Mr. Producer? Hours after talking [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1337.36s)]
*  to Trump, Musk apologized for inflammatory social media posts he directed at Trump when the two men [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1343.36s)]
*  went back and forth last week in their combative war words. Quote, I regret some of my posts about [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1348.88s)]
*  President Trump last week. They went too far. The White House would not confirm or deny Musk's call [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1354.96s)]
*  to Trump, nor should they, because this is a leak. And it goes on to regurgitate some of his posts, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1362.96s)]
*  because, you know, the media want the fights. They want the fights. They want the grift. They [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1371.6000000000001s)]
*  want the hits. That's what they want. That's all they have. They don't have news. They don't have [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1375.68s)]
*  news. And so I happen to think this is a good thing. I happen to think it's a good thing. Elon Musk has [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1380.72s)]
*  done a great deal for the country as an entrepreneur. He did a great deal for the campaign. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1390.4s)]
*  He's done a great deal when it comes to a government bloat. He's taken a lot of hits left [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1396.16s)]
*  and right. I don't know what happened, but it doesn't matter. He's taken the step to do [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1400.8s)]
*  what John Adams did and he should do. And Donald Trump should not have apologized or called first, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1408.8799999999999s)]
*  because he didn't do anything. But I think his reaction has been good. And as I said on the [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1414.6399999999999s)]
*  program on Sunday, he's a very forgiving man. Just look around him. Look around him. People have said [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1422.24s)]
*  some horrific things about him. I don't mean just criticism or supported another candidate. I mean, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1429.52s)]
*  have said the worst of the worst. And he's appointed several of them into his administration. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1434.48s)]
*  And one of them can't stop calling him. Right, Katarzyn? And they've said horrendous things [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1440.4s)]
*  about him. Horrendous. Again, it's one thing in a primary to support another candidate and so forth. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1446.8799999999999s)]
*  That's not what I'm talking about. That's not what I'm talking about. To get down to some other [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1452.96s)]
*  business here, they're rioters and they're supporters. Now, before I get into a fulsome [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1458.96s)]
*  explanation of what's going on here beyond some of the surface level discussions, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1467.1200000000001s)]
*  I want you to listen to this guy, Chuck Hagel. He was a Republican senator from Nebraska. Very strange [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1473.44s)]
*  man. He's the former Obama secretary of defense. He has spent years trashing Trump, years trashing [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1478.48s)]
*  Republicans. Very strange guy. And listen to his take. And, you know, here's the thing. Why would [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1487.44s)]
*  CBS Evening News go to Chuck Hagel? How do they even know where to find him? You talk about an old [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1497.6000000000001s)]
*  man. He's got to be in his 90s, I guess. Late 80s. And there's nothing wrong with that, by the way, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1504.64s)]
*  Katarelson. Katarelson, you could be in your 50s and have the mind of an imbecile. He's 78. I apologize. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1510.64s)]
*  But here he is. And egged on by CBS Evening News, although they don't have to egg him on much. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1523.44s)]
*  Hat-tip newsbusters, cut three go. What would be your biggest concern then about having National [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1528.96s)]
*  Guard and Marines deployed in large American cities? Loss of life, like we saw in 1970. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1534.16s)]
*  But 1970 at Kent State. At Kent State, when the National Guard opened up on students and killed [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1542.48s)]
*  students, partly because they weren't trained. They panicked. When they hear the president say, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1548.64s)]
*  if there are protests, I'm going to send troops in other cities or to other places, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1555.0400000000002s)]
*  how would officers likely be reacting when they hear that? You know, stop a minute. This is so [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1559.1200000000001s)]
*  disgusting and disgraceful. It truly is disgusting and disgraceful. It sounds like this was all [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1563.84s)]
*  planned. Kent State, 1970, Kent State doesn't come immediately to mind. Most people does to me just [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1572.9599999999998s)]
*  because I'm a nerd on this stuff. But nonetheless. And then they're asking him to project how would [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1578.24s)]
*  officers respond to this? Is this news, America? Is this news? No, it's not news. It's not even [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1584.24s)]
*  close to news. Go ahead. Our top leadership will have if this continues is am I going to get to [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1591.44s)]
*  the point where I may have to refuse a direct order to send in or give troops authority to do [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1602.4s)]
*  whatever? And I would think even contemplating defying an order from the commander in chief is [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1609.3600000000001s)]
*  a nightmare scenario for most officers. Sure. Contemplating a scenario like that is a career [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1616.08s)]
*  ending decision. So they're talking about exactly nothing that's taking place, Mr. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1622.3999999999999s)]
*  Producer. Zero. Nothing. Speculating. Always to the detriment of Donald Trump and the country. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1627.52s)]
*  Just speculating. This is a nothing story. It's not news. It's a pseudo event, as we call them. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1637.84s)]
*  A pseudo event. CBS News has substantial resources. Are they going to look into who's been funding [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1646.24s)]
*  this stuff? No. Are they going to look into who's been funding the riots, the Islamists, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1652.96s)]
*  the Marxists, the Jew haters on our college campuses? No. Other organizations have done it, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1658.1599999999999s)]
*  and I've brought that to you as well. Funny, isn't it? How the isolationists never talk about [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1664.48s)]

*  Remember what Rush always said? Follow the money. And he couldn't stand, by the way, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1676.8799999999999s)]
*  Chadworth. But follow the money. Follow his money. Follow the money of the illegal aliens. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1681.12s)]
*  Follow the money of the Islamists. Follow it. Well, we know where it leads, don't we? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1688.3999999999999s)]

*  Here's an illegal alien in LA, Monday. To hear what he had to say, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1697.2s)]
*  hat tip Willie Nelson TV on X. Cut one go. We don't agree with the term illegal. We're [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1706.8s)]
*  undocumented. We've been here for thousands of years before you guys showed up, screwed up [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1713.2s)]
*  everything. We're anti-capitalist. We think socialism does work. Real socialism. Is there [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1719.2s)]
*  a country we can look to to kind of model the socialism idea? The only model would be [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1726.0s)]
*  Soviet Union the first four years. Now, those of you who've read American Marxism, you know exactly [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1733.2s)]
*  what's going on here. You see, the citizens of America, you're the interlopers. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1738.4s)]
*  Started out with the white Europeans. You're the interlopers. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1746.64s)]
*  You're called, you want to know what you're called? You're called Americanists. Americanists [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1750.0s)]
*  in the books, in the essays written by the Marxist race-baiters that people like this read. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1754.8s)]
*  And if you speak out against it, like Charlie Kirk or me or others, oh, you must be a racist. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1763.4399999999998s)]
*  No, we're not racists. You in the media, you're the racists. You're the propagandists. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1767.36s)]
*  You're the ones who defend the Islamists and Hamas, the Marxists. That's you, not us. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1774.48s)]
*  But you heard what the guy said. I've told you before, it's a revolution. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1781.28s)]
*  These are revolutionaries and the Democrat party loves them because that's what fundamental [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1784.88s)]
*  transformation is all about. And here's an LA protester this week, Hatib Nick Shirley on X, [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1789.2s)]
*  cut to go. This is our city and this was Mexico. You can't kick us out of the land that was ours. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1799.76s)]
*  Donald Trump, fascism, let our people free. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1810.16s)]
*  Oh, sounds like the free Palestine crowd, doesn't it, Mr. Producer? [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1814.6399999999999s)]
*  So these people claim to be the indigenous peoples. They're not the indigenous peoples. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1823.36s)]
*  I can get into that one day, but it's not really my focus. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1829.92s)]
*  So you see, you citizens of the United States, especially you white citizens of the United States [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1834.8s)]
*  whose ancestry is European, but not just you, anybody else who's here, who's not from Mexico [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1840.48s)]
*  or this place or that place, you're the interlopers. You stole our land. You stole our land. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1847.76s)]
*  You're the interlopers. You stole our land. Get out of our country. Sounds familiar? Israel? [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1855.36s)]
*  I think it does, but that's what they're saying. So this isn't just about [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1861.84s)]
*  Donald Trump and his policies. These people believe they have an absolute right to be here, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1869.9199999999998s)]
*  period, that this is their land, period, that you took it, period. These are revolutionaries. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1877.68s)]
*  Now the media will mostly show you, now the two media sources I cite here, Willie Nelson TV on X, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1887.1200000000001s)]
*  Nick Shirley on X, these are small independents, individuals, but the corporate media [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1893.28s)]
*  I saw on MSLSD with Pasaki, they're going to all the sob stories where families, their fathers [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1900.8s)]
*  taken overseas, excuse me, sent back overseas and this one and that one, and you hear the stories, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1908.8799999999999s)]
*  they spend more time on that, more time on that than they do on the criminals [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1914.0s)]
*  and what they're doing to American citizens. Let me remind everybody, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1920.96s)]
*  immigration is about what the American citizen wants, not what the foreign alien wants or demands. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1924.8s)]
*  Immigration is about what benefits the United States from the perspective of the American [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1932.3999999999999s)]
*  citizen. Our representatives are supposed to represent you and me. In the cities, the [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1938.8799999999999s)]
*  representatives represent foreigners, illegal aliens, and others, and they represent the [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1945.04s)]
*  immigrants and they get voted in over and over again, over and over again, because of the Marxist [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1953.12s)]
*  ideology, because of the democrat identification, and people go in, they vote democrat, and these [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1960.6399999999999s)]
*  representatives represent them, yes, but illegal aliens, and it's also their effort to change [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1968.56s)]
*  society. The New York Times gave it away a few months ago, we read from the New York Times, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1976.9599999999998s)]
*  they said about changing the population. The democrats are doing it, they know exactly what [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1982.24s)]
*  they're doing, they know exactly, and that's what they're doing. So nothing I've said is white [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1988.08s)]
*  supremacist, nothing I've said is racist, it's the truth, it is reality. From all the little, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=1993.84s)]
*  all the little bastards over there at MediaEight and other places, the overwhelming majority of [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2002.32s)]
*  whom are white with European heritage, they must be racists. I'll be right back. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2007.92s)]
*  Americans sent President Trump back to Washington with a mandate to solve the border crisis, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2024.48s)]
*  reverse the effects of Biden's inflation, and restore American greatness, but at every turn, [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2028.88s)]
*  judges are blocking President Trump's attempts to fulfill this mandate. The Heritage Foundation [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2033.68s)]

*  This Karen Bass is a castorite, she is a disaster. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2082.56s)]
*  I asked the people who are trying to rebuild in the Los Angeles area if there wasn't any water for [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2085.68s)]
*  the firefighters. They can't even get the zoning approved and so forth. It's just such a disgrace. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2092.96s)]
*  And here she is on the morning Joe show, and cut four, go. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2099.3599999999997s)]
*  I do hope that people understand that this is a relatively small slice of Los Angeles, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2105.44s)]
*  a city with 500 square miles and this is about two square miles of our downtown area. So it'll be [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2111.28s)]
*  interesting to see what happens today. But understand that the real thing that's happening [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2119.6000000000004s)]
*  here are the egregious ice raids and we don't know when or where that's going to happen. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2124.2400000000002s)]
*  And I do think that that will be a test as to where the city goes today in the next couple of days. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2130.96s)]
*  So in other words, do not remove illegal aliens including criminals. That's the position of the mayor. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2137.52s)]
*  It just, you know, when you know history and you don't have to know a lot of it, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2149.44s)]
*  and you see the kind of reprobates that are in these positions now, it's really stunning. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2154.4s)]
*  And many of you are thinking, well how do people vote for something like this? But they do. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2160.4s)]
*  Again, when you look at history over the last hundred or more years, [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2164.88s)]
*  but especially modern history over the last hundred and some years, [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2168.1600000000003s)]
*  people do vote. They vote for fascism and Marxism, and then they realize the bill of goods they were [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2172.7200000000003s)]
*  sold were that, a bill of goods, and they can't reverse course. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2179.2000000000003s)]
*  And what these politicians do is they change the electorate to a communist state, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2187.84s)]
*  and what these politicians do is they change the electorate to accommodate their power grabs. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2192.0s)]
*  Did I read somewhere that 10 percent of California is made up of illegal aliens or something, Mr. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2199.76s)]
*  Producer? Something of that sort. Well there you go. It's a constituency group. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2204.88s)]
*  A constituency group. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2212.8s)]
*  So it's the raids. It's the enforcement of immigration laws. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2217.6800000000003s)]
*  That's the problem. So lawlessness is the answer, according to the mayor of LA. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2222.16s)]
*  She's not done. Cut for a go. It is completely unnecessary. What are they going to do? [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2231.6800000000003s)]
*  The 100 National Guard soldiers that are downtown Los Angeles are guarding one federal building, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2238.4s)]
*  so there is no need for this. The city handled things perfectly last night. You're such a liar. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2245.6s)]
*  You're such a fraud and a phony. If the National Guard hadn't been there, it would have burned [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2251.28s)]
*  down. And if they weren't backed by the Marines, God knows what would have happened. When those [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2255.6800000000003s)]
*  people saw the military coming there, they wet themselves. That's what they did. And it gave the [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2260.88s)]
*  police the opportunity to do what the police needed to do. The police chief said he was [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2267.36s)]
*  overwhelmed. You know, it's just like she lied about the fires. So what did she do? She fired the [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2272.32s)]
*  fire chief. This woman came to make sure that the fire hydrants have water pressure [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2277.2s)]
*  and water. And now they're making it impossible for people to rebuild. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2283.4399999999996s)]
*  It's just incredible. And they're up against a doer, a man who puts his foot down, a man who does [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2291.2799999999997s)]

*  Israel. No, they slaughtered people. That's what they did. They didn't just attack Israel. Then [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2544.32s)]
*  they say an Israel subsequent military assault. This is Reuters. I think it's based in Britain [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2552.2400000000002s)]

*  That's not the issue. The issue is you're not allowed to support terrorist organizations, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2589.1200000000003s)]

*  Now, listen to how this goes on. This is Reuters. The Hamas attack killed 1,195 people, [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2603.68s)]
*  according to Israeli tallies. An Israel's military campaign has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2611.2000000000003s)]

*  one. Number two, even Hamas has put out information saying that they overstated the casualties [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2630.72s)]
*  because they were being humiliated with their propaganda by experts who said it wasn't possible. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2638.48s)]
*  Number three, you don't cite the Israelis who say up to 20,000 of the so-called [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2645.2799999999997s)]
*  Palestinians who were killed were terrorists. So this is Reuters. If you read this from top to bottom [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2649.84s)]
*  and you're your typical lib, you're going to think this is fantastic. That this punk, [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2656.7200000000003s)]

*  Remember that, Mr. Producer? Poor Khalil. Oh my goodness, his wife and he's pregnant. She's pregnant. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2670.08s)]

*  did Biden screw up this country big time. He's not the only one, of course. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2685.6s)]
*  But I'll tell you what, just a, what a disaster. Gavin Newsom's major address yesterday. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2691.7599999999998s)]
*  Just disgusting. His major address yesterday. Let's go to cut seven, Mr. Producer, go. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2700.72s)]
*  Look, this isn't just about protests here in Los Angeles. When Donald Trump sought blanket [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2707.3599999999997s)]
*  authority to commandeer the National Guard, he made that order. He didn't seek blanket authority [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2713.4399999999996s)]
*  to commandeer the National Guard. Look how they lie. The National Guard was federalized. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2718.8799999999997s)]
*  That's the way it works. It's been federalized before. When you have a governor who stands [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2728.56s)]
*  against law and order, whether it is a governor who stands for segregation and won't let black [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2736.48s)]
*  kids go to school with white kids, or a governor who won't allow ICE to deport criminals and won't [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2741.52s)]
*  protect the free citizens of a city or a state, the president has the absolute authority to step in. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2749.68s)]
*  And he can step in by federalizing the National Guard, as they've done multiple times in the past, [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2758.64s)]
*  or by using the Insurrection Act of 1803. And I would remind Chatsworth Osborne [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2764.56s)]
*  Katarelson, that's an old law. Yes, it is. It's an old law. But it's an important law. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2772.4s)]
*  And that can be used too, to deal with the insurrectionists. And that's what they are. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2780.4s)]
*  Now, Jose Luis Salashe is a California state assemblyman. And this guy lays it out. You [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2785.04s)]
*  literally have Democrats who are elected to office, who are demanding lawlessness, [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2798.4s)]

*  How would you like to see federal immigration laws enforced? [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2818.56s)]
*  We've known that previous administrations have conducted deportations. There was never a need [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2824.8799999999997s)]
*  to do a militarization. There's never a need to bring these agents in our communities. There's [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2831.7599999999998s)]
*  a dual process. The agents came under attack, moron. There wasn't a militarization. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2836.56s)]
*  Now, CNN, this reprobates Sarah Sidner, or Seigner, or whatever, who cares? [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2847.04s)]
*  She didn't interrupt and say, well, wait a minute, it wasn't the militarization. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2856.32s)]
*  The ICE officials came under attack. That is a crime. That is a federal felony. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2859.84s)]
*  Who cares? It doesn't matter. We've got a narrative to push. Go ahead. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2864.56s)]
*  We're proud to be Americans, but there's a process for this. And yes, previous administrations did [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2870.2400000000002s)]
*  them, but in this case, this current administration is going the wrong way of conducting these [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2875.04s)]
*  processes and cleaning these unacceptable rapes in our communities. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2881.76s)]

*  There is criticism that seems to suggest that the president responded the way he did, [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2940.32s)]
*  because it was a deliberate, calculated attempt to shift focus away from his feud with Musk. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2944.48s)]
*  So Trump sends in the National Guard to shift focus away from Musk. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2950.48s)]
*  There was no focus on Musk. The American people aren't even focused on that. What is she talking [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2957.28s)]

*  remember that. This is the media that covered up for Biden, that lied for Biden, that told you what [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2973.6s)]
*  you see you didn't see, what you heard you didn't hear. They lied and lied year after year after [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2978.32s)]

*  the same media. Go ahead. The president responded to the LA riots, condemning the violence to [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2989.36s)]
*  Trump and Musk. That's incredibly disingenuous. First of all, she's interrupting her. She doesn't [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=2999.92s)]

*  as non-citizens such as green card holders, foreign students, guest workers, and illegal immigrants [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3208.1600000000003s)]
*  are captured in the census every 10 years. Isn't that a crime? Isn't that shocking? [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3216.4s)]
*  Because the legal and illegal immigrant population is so large and unevenly distributed across the [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3223.92s)]
*  country, it causes some states to gain seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and Electoral [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3230.96s)]
*  College at the expense of others. Equally important, immigration shifts political representation away [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3236.32s)]
*  from American citizens and towards states and districts with large non-citizen populations. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3244.32s)]
*  An investigation by the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that immigrants, legal and [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3253.52s)]
*  illegal, counted in the 2020 census, shifted 17 seats in the House of Representatives and votes [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3258.32s)]
*  in the Electoral College. Now you know why the Democrats will fight to the last reprobate [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3267.04s)]
*  to defend every illegal alien, criminal or non, and keep them in this country. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3273.04s)]
*  It's about power. It's always about power, as my book points out. The big winner is California. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3278.4s)]
*  Remember this was written a year and a half ago. The big winner is California, which has eight more [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3284.96s)]
*  seats than it would without immigrants. The states that lose tend to be low immigration states in the [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3290.4s)]
*  south and the midwest such as Ohio and Tennessee. The inclusion of non-citizens alone shifts six [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3297.92s)]
*  house seats with half the increase going to California. Illegal immigration caused two [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3304.96s)]
*  seats to change hands. Now keep in mind this is before the massive influx, although it was going [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3310.88s)]
*  on before it was completed by Biden, so it's worse. Now this redistribution of political power has [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3318.2400000000002s)]
*  significant partisan implications with Democrat leading states experiencing a net gain of 14 seats [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3326.08s)]
*  and electoral votes due to immigration. While Republican states had 10 fewer seats, [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3334.4s)]
*  battlegrounds had four fewer seats. Non-citizens alone accounted for five of the seats gained by [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3341.04s)]
*  Democrat states in the last census. Keep in mind that the border surge had not yet occurred when [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3347.52s)]
*  the 2020 census was taken. If the total legal and illegal immigration population continues to grow at [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3355.44s)]
*  the current rapid pace, immigrants in the 2030 census will redistribute 22 seats in electoral votes [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3363.6s)]
*  while illegal immigrants will redistribute seven seats. The settlement of so many immigrants may [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3372.64s)]
*  change the political alignment of states in unpredictable ways, though it stands to reason [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3379.36s)]
*  that as immigrants settle in larger numbers in states such as New York and California, [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3385.04s)]
*  Democrats are likely to see greater gains. The political distortions created by immigration [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3390.56s)]
*  are even more pronounced in congressional districts. Each district in a state has roughly [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3398.48s)]
*  the same number of people, but they don't have the same number of legal voters. Yet in 2022, [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3404.56s)]
*  at the time of the last election, again this was written 2024 right before the election, [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3411.92s)]
*  New York's sixth district in Queens represented by Democrat Grace Meng had 169,000 fewer voting [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3418.32s)]
*  age citizens than in the 21st congressional district in upstate represented by Republican [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3426.7200000000003s)]
*  Elise Stefanik. Let me underscore this. You had a district in the Queens represented by a Democrat [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3433.04s)]
*  that 169,000 fewer voting age citizens than in Elise Stefanik's district. So the point is they're [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3439.52s)]
*  not voting. It doesn't matter, he's saying, because you look at the number. They're counted [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3447.04s)]
*  as part of the census. So you have a bloated district with illegal aliens that votes Democrat. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3454.72s)]
*  There are many districts like this throughout the country. Not surprisingly, it takes many more votes [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3459.84s)]
*  to win in districts comprised largely of citizens. 2022, the winning candidate received 73% more votes [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3465.52s)]
*  in the 54 districts where less than 2% of adults are non-citizens than in the two dozen districts [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3474.56s)]
*  where one in five adults is not an American citizen. This raises important questions of [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3482.0s)]
*  the principle of one person, one vote. In effect, the votes of American citizens who live around [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3487.2s)]
*  non-citizens count much more than the votes of Americans who live in high citizen areas. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3492.56s)]
*  So let's take it theoretically. Let's say of a district and there's 10,000 citizens [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3499.2s)]
*  and 750,000 illegal aliens. While that counts as a congressional district, let's say the 10,000 [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3504.24s)]
*  citizens, 9,000 are Democrats. They elect the Democrat. Amazing, isn't it? Pure Talk, my wireless [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3510.4799999999996s)]

*  First Amendment rights of peaceful protesters? See, everything that's asked is from the perspective [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3599.52s)]
*  of the lawless. From the lawless. Cut 12, go. You were just asked about the First Amendment rights [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3604.72s)]
*  issues. In the President's comments yesterday, though, he just said protesters would be strongly [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3615.7599999999998s)]
*  dealt with. In your list before, you referred to insurrectionists, rioters, and protesters [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3623.04s)]
*  together. Obviously, they're quite different from your earlier answer. I'm struck by the fact that [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3629.6s)]
*  the President has not- I'll tell you what I'm struck by. We had women who were praying silently [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3634.7999999999997s)]
*  in front of abortion clinics and you now have had one question about the First Amendment. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3640.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm struck by the fact that when people raise questions about vaccines or raise questions about [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3645.2799999999997s)]
*  the source of the COVID-19 virus, nobody talked about their First Amendment rights other than the [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3650.64s)]
*  people who are being condemned. So all of a sudden, the media is concerned about the First [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3656.56s)]
*  Amendment when it comes to Islamists, Marxists, illegal aliens, violent, riotous individuals. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3660.88s)]
*  It's an amazing thing. All we hear about is the First Amendment due process. Again, when it comes [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3666.64s)]
*  to pro-lifers, no. When it comes to Catholics, no. I'll go so far when it comes to Jews on college [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3671.84s)]
*  campuses, no. When it comes to questions that are raised about government policy, whether it's [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3677.7599999999998s)]
*  vaccines or anything else, no. No, no, and no again. But now, we're quite concerned. When the [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3685.28s)]
*  President said protesters, what about the First Amendment? Go ahead. The important thing here is [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3692.7200000000003s)]
*  to protect the First Amendment rights of peaceful protesters. So I'm wondering, where in his hierarchy [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3699.52s)]
*  of interests does he place that? Is the First Amendment protection the most important? Is [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3705.0400000000004s)]
*  stopping violence most important? Why is he not out saying all peaceful protesters will be protected? [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3711.52s)]
*  I think two things can be important at the same time. And the President, as I just answered, [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3719.44s)]
*  supports the right of Americans to peacefully protest. He supports the First Amendment, [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3724.08s)]
*  but that is not the majority of the behavior that we have seen taking place in Los Angeles. We have [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3728.08s)]
*  seen mobs of violent rioters and agitators assaulting law enforcement officers, assaulting [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3733.6s)]
*  our federal immigration authorities. And we have seen, as I said, this goes back to what this [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3739.68s)]
*  administration is trying to do and accomplish, and that's enforcing law and order in our nation's [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3745.44s)]
*  communities. And it's removing public safety threats from communities in Los Angeles. You're [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3749.6s)]
*  saying the majority have not been peaceful, the majority of them. I just read for you the arrest [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3754.7999999999997s)]
*  numbers. You know, pal, you really are a putz. She didn't say that. But what's the difference, [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3758.96s)]
*  whether majority are or minority are? We're not taking a poll. It's the people who are violent [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3767.36s)]
*  that need to be addressed. Now, tell me, were the majority of the people in January 6 violent? No, [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3772.88s)]
*  the overwhelming majority weren't. Well, how come they don't get questions like this, the Democrats? [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3779.76s)]
*  Instead, the media are attacking, attacking, attacking January 6. There were what, half a [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3784.1600000000003s)]
*  million people or a million people, whatever it was. And you had what took place at the Capitol [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3788.6400000000003s)]
*  building. And even there, there was a very small percentage of the people who were at the Capitol [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3793.28s)]
*  building who were violent. Now, they were violent, they're violent, they're dealt with, but that's [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3797.84s)]
*  not the point. Everybody was grabbed up and picked up. Nobody asked about due process rights. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3802.0800000000004s)]
*  Nobody asked about free speech. Nobody asked about a damn thing. Not a damn thing. That reporters. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3807.2000000000003s)]
*  Now, instead, we circle the date on our calendar to remind ourselves of what could have been. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3813.6000000000004s)]
*  Meanwhile, you have all these radical, radical Marxist Islamists, illegal aliens, even talking [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3818.24s)]
*  about overthrowing the country, real criminals who've killed people, who've raped people, [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3826.9599999999996s)]
*  who've done horrendous things. We're trying to track them down. We're trying to remove them [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3831.7599999999998s)]
*  from the country and send them back home. Bye. And what are they doing? Carrying their homes flag, [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3836.16s)]
*  burning the American flag, trashing our system of government, our system, our economic system. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3842.4s)]
*  And these bird brains who are supposedly journalists, look how they ask questions. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3848.4s)]
*  They never asked about due process for the January Sixers. They never said that the vast majority [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3854.08s)]
*  were peaceful. They don't talk the same way when it comes to American citizens, do they? [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3859.6s)]
*  Okay. Go ahead. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=3864.32s)]

*  These are Islamists doing these things, right? They're in the streets. There are colleges and [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4612.08s)]

*  compost and all the rest of our media, our Pravda Al Jazeera media report, look what the Israelis [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4712.56s)]
*  and the Jews, the oppressors are doing to these poor people when it is over and over again Hamas [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4719.44s)]
*  that has the weapons in the hospitals, Hamas that has the terrorists in their mosques. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4725.12s)]
*  When it's Hamas that uses children and women as fodder. It's said over and over again, [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4733.2s)]
*  it's proven over and over again, it doesn't matter. Earlier this week threatening texts [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4739.52s)]
*  that were sent by Hamas to aid workers, these are Palestinian workers operating in Gaza, [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4746.4s)]

*  consequences. Quote, we are fully aware of everything you are doing and all your movements [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4757.52s)]
*  are being monitored with extreme precision, said Hamas to these aid workers. You will not be [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4763.200000000001s)]
*  forgiven for your involvement in projects that harm the dignity of our people and serve suspicious [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4768.4800000000005s)]

*  will have severe consequences and you will bear full responsibility for the outcomes of your actions. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4781.280000000001s)]
*  Stop now or else. These are the texts. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4787.36s)]
*  The texts. So what do they do? They killed five of them just now. They killed five of them on the [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4793.839999999999s)]
*  bus and injured over two dozen others of the Gaza humanitarian foundation that is bringing them food [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4801.92s)]
*  from the Israelis. That seems like genocide to me. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4809.2s)]
*  Yes, that's very comical, I would say. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4820.32s)]
*  Sick. More Pam Bondi and Lawrence Jones. Cut 15. Go. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4826.8s)]
*  Attack and anti-Semitism, which is a very real problem in this country and in the world has been [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4839.28s)]
*  distorted and weaponized. I mean, that reads like something straight out of Hamas's media [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4844.8s)]
*  organization that is trying to spend this. What's your response? Yeah, they are promoting the [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4850.32s)]
*  anti-Semitism and not only promoting it, encouraging it throughout our country. We will not stand for [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4856.48s)]
*  it. We will protect our Jewish citizens. We will fight for them. I was on the scene, Lawrence, [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4862.96s)]
*  of that horrific murder involving, of course, the young couple leaving the Jewish museum. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4867.44s)]
*  Then after that, of course, look what happened in Boulder, Colorado. It's escalating. These words [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4873.44s)]
*  encourage escalation. Putting things on your menu that are so horrific. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4880.4s)]
*  Let me stop her there. And you damnable podcasters. I'm a podcaster too, but these damnable podcasters [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4884.799999999999s)]
*  who live in the world of anti-Semitism, they pretend they're asking questions. They pretend [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4891.44s)]
*  they don't know what's going on. When I just read you an article that's available for the [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4899.12s)]
*  whole world to read, these disgusting people who pretend that Iran is not seeking a nuclear weapon [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4902.48s)]
*  follow the money. So many of them are on the payroll of one of these, these entities or another. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4912.08s)]
*  These are disgusting podcasters. They are disgusting and they're not just podcasters. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4918.24s)]
*  They call themselves influencers. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4924.96s)]
*  They lie to you. They deceive you. They are false prophets. They pretend that they care about you. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4930.24s)]
*  They pretend they care about this country. They pretend they don't want war when in fact, [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4937.44s)]
*  their conduct in support of the warmongers in the Middle East and others is likely to cause war. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4943.68s)]
*  This administration is fighting anti-Semitism. It's fighting people who are violent illegal [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4953.04s)]
*  aliens. This administration is doing what's right. The president of the United States will do what's [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4960.400000000001s)]
*  right. Because unlike these fools, these frauds, these phonies and these reprobates, these low IQ [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4964.56s)]
*  low lives, I have faith in the president. We're MAGA. They're not MAGA. We're real MAGA. Make [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4971.84s)]
*  America great again. A phrase that was used by Ronald Reagan. We are Reaganites. We are Trumpites. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4980.24s)]
*  We are constitutional conservatives. We believe in Americanism. That's the only ism that matters [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4987.2s)]
*  to us. That's who we are. It's too bad that I'm one of the few standing up to them. One of the few, [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=4993.36s)]
*  but there will be more. There will be many more. Many more by the time this is over. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5004.0s)]
*  I'll be right back. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5014.639999999999s)]
*  Here we have the New York Post. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5023.36s)]
*  By the way, it's June 11th. As you may know, my father would have been 100 years old today. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5035.839999999999s)]
*  Of course, he passed away, what will be seven years in October. I think about my parents often. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5041.12s)]
*  I think about them every day. I wonder what they think about what's going on in the country. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5048.32s)]
*  I would hope they think that I'm doing the right thing, trying to defend this country, [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5057.12s)]
*  take on its enemies, foreign and domestic. They used to call me after every single radio program, [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5064.719999999999s)]
*  they used to call me after every single radio program, Mr. Producer. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5072.4800000000005s)]
*  So basically, I had to do another 20 minutes of radio. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5078.320000000001s)]
*  But they were always supportive of their son, always. Always. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5083.4400000000005s)]
*  When people throw the term warmonger around, [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5093.92s)]
*  my family's been to war in some of the worst places and some of the battles on the face of the earth. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5096.08s)]
*  I don't need lectures from prep school graduates, barely graduates, and trust fund babies. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5103.28s)]
*  I don't need lectures from comedians with low IQs and who don't try and improve their knowledge of history [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5113.04s)]
*  and events. I don't need lectures from any of them and neither do you. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5120.639999999999s)]
*  You have more experiences than them. You have more real life travails and challenges than them. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5126.4s)]
*  Many of you grew up the hard way. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5138.16s)]
*  My parents grew up the hard way, very hard way, very poor. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5142.0s)]
*  My parents grew up the hard way, very hard way, very poor. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5146.0s)]
*  They worked for everything they got. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5151.68s)]
*  They didn't inherit anything from any of them, anybody, Swanson Foods or what have you. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5156.240000000001s)]
*  They lived the American dream. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5165.84s)]
*  They worked their way out of poverty, became part of the middle class, lower middle class, [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5167.92s)]
*  but middle class nonetheless. They had a little store, first a camp and a nursery school, [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5172.96s)]
*  but later a store outside of Philadelphia in Jenkins Town on Old York Road. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5178.8s)]
*  And having a little store is a lot of work [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5186.16s)]
*  and having a little store is a lot of work [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5189.4400000000005s)]
*  because you work all day and you don't know if people are actually going to come into your [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5195.280000000001s)]
*  store and spend money. They didn't sell food, they didn't sell necessities, so when there was a [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5198.400000000001s)]
*  recession and there were recessions, the family would feel it directly, directly. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5204.56s)]
*  And the more I think back on it, the more they concealed tough times, but I remember the meals [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5214.08s)]
*  with hot dogs and the rest and we loved them. I remember when my mother would make what we called [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5218.72s)]
*  Russian dressing with mayonnaise and ketchup because they didn't buy Thousand Island. I remember [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5224.5599999999995s)]
*  when we had Campbell's soup, noodle soup, and the more I think about it as I'm behind this microphone, [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5230.24s)]
*  I know why. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5235.44s)]
*  Nothing was extravagant, nothing. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5236.5599999999995s)]
*  That's how I grew up. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5242.16s)]
*  I grew up to love this country. My mother's father was a Marine. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5246.4s)]
*  He lived through the Depression and then World War II. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5255.2s)]
*  But he saw a lot of his buddies murdered, killed, only Iwo Jima and Guam. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5260.4s)]
*  He signed up. I would tell Tulsi Gabbard after we were attacked at Pearl Harbor. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5267.2s)]
*  He and his brother-in-law went to Philadelphia, went down to downtown Florida, [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5280.16s)]
*  together, and they signed up. And they were immediately moved into boot camp. They were both Marines. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5284.24s)]
*  He was 34. That was the cut-off age, 34. My father immediately joined, or sought to join the Army at the age of 17. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5293.12s)]
*  34. My father immediately joined, or sought to join the Army at the age of 17. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5303.599999999999s)]
*  I don't need lectures about war from people whose family... [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5316.08s)]
*  Well, let me put it to you this way. I don't need lectures. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5323.04s)]
*  My grandfather came back because of his experiences in war. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5325.36s)]
*  I've told this before. He lost his voice. He talked like this. He was a tough man, tough, tough man. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5333.36s)]
*  Big strong hands. Same with his brother-in-law. These were tough guys. These were guys I would take. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5343.36s)]
*  These were guys that would take a beat-up truck that they'd borrow from a neighbor, [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5351.36s)]
*  which had old wooden rails on the side, and they would drive from Germantown in Philadelphia [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5359.36s)]
*  to the coal mines in western Pennsylvania. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5369.36s)]
*  And they'd fill up that truck during the Depression. They'd drive all the way back to Philadelphia. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5373.36s)]
*  These were not comfortable trucks. They'd sell the coal door-to-door to make a buck. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5381.36s)]
*  And back then coal was used inside the house. They heat the house, they heat the food, and all the rest. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5389.36s)]
*  And so they went to war because America was attacked at Pearl Harbor. And they weren't alone. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5401.36s)]
*  Millions of men, Jews, Italian, Germans, Irishmen, Poles, you name it. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5415.36s)]
*  They went to war. Many of them didn't come back. Many of them were scarred for life. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5431.36s)]
*  My grandfather, before he was a Marine, was also a boxer. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5443.36s)]
*  My older brother, who's turned 70 years old, he was a boxer too. He was also a bouncer. He was also brilliant. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5451.36s)]
*  He could tell you anything about American history, anything about American wars, anything. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5463.36s)]
*  He, like my father, would study cars and planes and jets, and they knew everything about them. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5471.36s)]
*  I miss my brother, one of the most decent human beings on the face of the earth. He's alive, but he has Alzheimer's. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5483.36s)]
*  And I know what he would be saying to his younger brother too. Keep fighting. America's worth it. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5503.36s)]
*  When I see what other people have been up against, relatives, family members, strangers, you in the audience, what I do is nothing. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5519.36s)]
*  The Barb's, from the little punks who sit behind their computers, here call their friends in the media and playin' stories. It's nothing. It's a game for them. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5531.36s)]
*  You're talking about a country like Iran that wants a nuclear weapon to destroy the State of Israel, the Holy Land for Jews and Christians. That's not a joke. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5543.36s)]
*  You're talking about a country like Iran that is building hypersonic missiles, or I should say, intercontinental ballistic missiles, at a rate that's unbelievable to hit our country. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5557.36s)]
*  Past generations have stepped up. Our generation needs to step up too. I'll be right back. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5570.36s)]
*  Mark Levin, an unapologetic patriot and unapologetic constitutionalist. You can reach him at 877-381-3811. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5580.36s)]
*  All right. Let's go to Robert. Washington, D.C. One of the great program managers, Bill Hess at WMAL. Go right ahead, please. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5596.36s)]
*  Hey, Mark Levin, the great one. Good to talk to you again. Thank you. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5608.36s)]
*  This is earlier in the show when you were talking about the district and the populations there. I follow a lot of bills on crackus.gov. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5614.36s)]
*  And so that's actually being addressed through one of the provisions in the big, beautiful bill. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5630.36s)]
*  But there's actually something that nobody's talking about that is seen as a provision, a possible provision in the big, beautiful bill. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5636.36s)]
*  And it is placing full blame and responsibility for the USS Liberty incident on the State of Israel by codifying statements made by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the time and the Secretary of State at the time. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5644.36s)]
*  And I was wondering if you and your staff have like encountered those in your research and why nobody is really talking about that. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5659.36s)]
*  First of all, I don't have a staff. I have Mr. Producer who handles all things production and audio and makes his program get on the air and function. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5667.36s)]
*  And we have Mr. Call Screener. We have a wonderful gentleman that handles affiliate relations. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5678.36s)]
*  So what is it exactly again that you want me to do? [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5686.36s)]
*  So the I mean, I mean, it was just I was interested in your thoughts on that. They're codifying in this big, beautiful bill. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5690.36s)]
*  They're codifying statements from their affirming statements from the 60s. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5699.36s)]
*  And I don't know why that would be in the bill. Why is that captured in the bill? What does that have to do? [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5705.36s)]
*  Codifying statements from the 60s. I'm still not following this. Maybe it's me. What do you mean? [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5711.36s)]
*  What state USS Liberty incident? Ah, there you go. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5718.36s)]
*  Proof they smoked you out. All right. Thanks for your call. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5723.36s)]
*  There you go. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5727.36s)]
*  Dancing around it. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5729.36s)]
*  Either Israelis wanted to kill American sailors. That's what the anti-Semites say. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5731.36s)]
*  They wanted to kill American sailors. That's what they did. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5737.36s)]
*  Ask them over at the American conservative, which is anything but. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5741.36s)]
*  That's what they bring up. And what was a total accident? [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5747.36s)]
*  But I'm not here to respond to all the nut jobs. I just can't. I don't have time for it. I really don't. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5752.36s)]
*  We'll leave that to the great podcasters. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5758.36s)]
*  Let's go to Mike L.A. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5762.36s)]
*  L.A. XM satellite. Mike, go right ahead, please. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5765.36s)]
*  Yeah, thanks for having me on. You know, Mark, I got to say you got to keep up. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5769.36s)]
*  Keep up the good fight. I know you worked for me, Thunder Reagan. Reagan was my commander in chief. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5773.36s)]
*  Yeah. And things are definitely changing. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5779.36s)]
*  In fact, I can kind of prove that the riots and stuff that they're having out there now, [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5783.36s)]
*  they have almost nothing to do with immigration. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5789.36s)]
*  It's that leftist agenda. They're trying to overthrow the country. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5792.36s)]
*  That's what they're trying to do. When I overthrow the country and here's how they're doing it. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5796.36s)]
*  They've laid it out. And if anybody wants to do the research, I already have. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5801.36s)]
*  And others before me have. And I would highly recommend, you know, because the stuff that I'm going to recommend is free. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5805.36s)]
*  You can get it on YouTube. OK. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5812.36s)]
*  Check out the movie that Ronald Reagan narrated called The Truth About Communism. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5815.36s)]
*  Mm hmm. About an hour, 50 something minutes long and has a lot of information. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5822.36s)]
*  You can see what's going on in our society right now. Yes. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5828.36s)]
*  And then agenda by former congressman Curtis Powers. Agenda. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5832.36s)]
*  I don't know Curtis Powers. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5839.36s)]
*  You know, Mike, we have our own hidden house gentleman. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5852.36s)]
*  And I say that tongue in cheek, Jimmy, who calls from Brooklyn, who's like the rain man on all this communism stuff. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5854.36s)]
*  He calls in from time to time and he's called into my program over 20 years. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5861.36s)]
*  Excuse me. And he's fantastic, too. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5866.36s)]
*  But you're right. And the book American Marxism that I wrote kind of spells it all out, too. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5870.36s)]
*  That's exactly what's taking place. You can hear what these illegal aliens are saying. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5874.36s)]
*  You can see what's going on in our college campuses. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5880.36s)]
*  And the biggest problem is the next generation of Americans, many of them anyway, are not going to be patriots. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5882.36s)]
*  They're not going to believe in America first. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5890.36s)]
*  In fact, a lot of the so-called American firsters believe in Iran first. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5892.36s)]
*  We've got Marxists. We've got Islamists. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5896.36s)]
*  We have illegal aliens who come into this country. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5899.36s)]
*  Many do come here, you know, for freedom. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5902.36s)]
*  But a lot of them come here for a free ride or to overthrow the country. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5905.36s)]
*  How do we know? Well, we watch and we listen. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5908.36s)]
*  That's how we know a lot of countries take advantage of this country, send their terrorists and their prisoners and their worst people into this country. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5911.36s)]
*  China sends their spies into this country. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5918.36s)]
*  And then we have on the radical extreme right. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5921.36s)]
*  And by that, I don't mean conservative or constitutionalism. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5925.36s)]
*  We have the 1930s crowd, the same ideology, the isolationist, the Lindberger types. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5928.36s)]
*  You know, we've got the Rand Paul's. We've got the Charles Cokeheads, that whole crowd. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5934.36s)]
*  They talk about, oh, you're old. Everything they're spewing is old and proven wrong at a grave cost to the American people. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5939.36s)]
*  All of it. And then we have a media in this country that's so Mickey Mouse that takes the plants, the garbage that they're given and just spews it and burps it up. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5947.36s)]
*  All they're interested in is controversy. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5957.36s)]
*  This thing that's been going on with my meeting with the president, I think we're in day five. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5959.36s)]
*  Articles say the same thing. And now the articles quote the articles. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5964.36s)]
*  It's the most asinine thing. And I'm going to keep responding to it and pointing it out because they expose themselves for what they are. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5968.36s)]
*  And we have a massive audience and I want people to know it. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5975.36s)]
*  Thank you for your call, my friend. By the way, we've had some people say, you know, you only have four point eight million followers on X. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5978.36s)]
*  You want to know why, ladies and gentlemen, because I don't live on X. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5989.36s)]
*  I don't live on social media. How many radio listeners do they have? [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=5995.36s)]
*  None. I do radio and television. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6001.36s)]
*  That's what I do. I'm not a social media platform guy. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6007.36s)]
*  I'm not. If I wanted 20 million people to follow me on Twitter, then I would make sure I have 20 million people to follow me on Twitter. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6014.36s)]
*  But that's where this scum lives. That's not where I live. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6028.36s)]
*  I live here on nearly 500 radio stations. I live here on Sirius satellite. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6032.36s)]
*  I live here on YouTube. I live here on streaming. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6040.36s)]
*  That's where I live. That's where my home is. That's where you're listening to me. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6046.36s)]
*  I don't live on Twitter, on Facebook. I don't even show up or any of these other platforms. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6051.36s)]
*  I participate, but you rarely ever hear me promote them. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6058.36s)]
*  Rarely ever. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6063.36s)]
*  The people who attack what we believe in are attacking you. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6068.36s)]
*  Just like the left. They use the same Marxist tactics. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6073.36s)]
*  They're attacking you, this audience, your beliefs, your love of country, your service to country. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6076.36s)]
*  That's what they're doing. I'm just exposing them. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6083.36s)]
*  And I'm going to continue to expose them. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6087.36s)]
*  I'm going to expose them every week, every month, every year, every decade. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6090.36s)]
*  Trump calls it the enemy within. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6098.36s)]
*  Let's go to Dave. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6102.36s)]
*  Ray Seen, Wisconsin on the Mark Levin app. Dave, how are you? [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6105.36s)]
*  Most satisfactory, Mark. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6109.36s)]
*  The question I have is with the increase of legal aliens thanks to Biden [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6112.36s)]
*  and the effect that that could have on the census in 2030, [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6120.36s)]
*  could the three-fifths compromise be jiggled around to maybe count these illegal aliens, [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6125.36s)]
*  reduce the effect of them on the congressional election or the number of congressional seats that can be available? [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6134.36s)]
*  Well, here's the thing. We can change it by statute and all, but then we have the courts. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6143.36s)]
*  So the leftists on the courts, installed there by the leftists in Congress [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6148.36s)]
*  and a leftist presidency, they will rule that under the Constitution they are to be included. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6153.36s)]
*  So the matter will eventually get to the Supreme Court [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6159.36s)]
*  and we'll have to hope that there's five justices who see it the other way, our way. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6162.36s)]
*  I can assure you the framers of your Constitution never had in mind, number one, illegal immigration, [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6166.36s)]
*  number two, that illegal immigration should be counted like citizens for the purpose of the census. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6172.36s)]
*  It would never have entered their mind any more than birthright citizenship did, which it didn't. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6178.36s)]
*  So this is all post-Constitution, what I call a post-Constitutional America. That's what it is. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6183.36s)]
*  Thank you for your call, my friend. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6191.36s)]
*  Friend just sent me from Rylan Givens. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6194.36s)]
*  I don't know Rylan Givens, but God bless him or her. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6198.36s)]
*  Watch, Trump was asked why military personnel were leaving the Middle East and he replied as follows, [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6202.36s)]
*  quote, you'll have to see they're moving away. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6210.36s)]
*  It could be a dangerous place. We'll have to see what happens. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6214.36s)]
*  Iran must not have nuclear weapons. We will not allow it. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6218.36s)]
*  And so I would say it's about time that the isolationists take their heads out of their own asses. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6222.36s)]
*  Pay attention to what the Commander in Chief is saying. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6228.36s)]
*  He calls the shots himself. He's not influenced by influencers. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6231.36s)]
*  He asks you your opinion, give him your opinion. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6235.36s)]
*  But you're trying to change what he is thinking about. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6238.36s)]
*  You're trying to change how he is serving as Commander in Chief. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6241.36s)]
*  Not me. I'm not trying to change anybody, but they are. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6245.36s)]
*  The problem is they hate us, you and me, patriots, when they should be hating Iran. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6249.36s)]
*  The problem is they dump on America like Tulsi Gabbard did [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6255.36s)]
*  when she went to Hiroshima and put out that blasphemous video [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6259.36s)]
*  when some of us had family members who fought in that war. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6263.36s)]
*  And she's another special pleader for Iran. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6267.36s)]
*  There's a whole cabal of these people. They're embedded. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6274.36s)]
*  They're outside the government wherever they are, wherever they are. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6278.36s)]
*  The Commander in Chief will do the right thing. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6283.36s)]
*  As he's done the right thing in L.A., as he's done the right thing [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6286.36s)]
*  with trying to cut government spending, as he's done the right thing [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6289.36s)]
*  trying to cut your taxes and secure the border, we voted for him. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6292.36s)]
*  We elected him. He said what he was going to do with this madman in Iran [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6297.36s)]
*  and their nuclear obsession. He keeps his promises. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6303.36s)]
*  And should it come to war? It won't be a full-scale war, [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6308.36s)]
*  but should it come to military action? [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6313.36s)]
*  He will have tried everything to avoid it [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6316.36s)]
*  because he has tried everything to avoid it. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6320.36s)]
*  And he has said he has tried everything to avoid it, [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6322.36s)]
*  but sometimes there are evil entities like the ones that brought down our towers on 9-11, [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6324.36s)]
*  like the ones that flew that jet into the Pentagon, [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6330.36s)]
*  like the ones that caused our heroes to die in central Pennsylvania, [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6334.36s)]
*  like the ones who murdered our people at two embassies. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6338.36s)]
*  How you defend this and how you blame America or conservatives or me is unbelievable. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6342.36s)]
*  Unbelievable. We'll be right back. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6351.36s)]
*  Could you provide an update on Iran? [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6368.36s)]
*  We're hearing reports that U.S. personnel are being moved out of the region within striking distance. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6370.36s)]
*  Well, they are being moved out because it could be a dangerous place [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6375.36s)]
*  and we'll see what happens, but they are been, we've given notice to move out [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6378.36s)]
*  and we'll see what happens. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6383.36s)]
*  Is there anything that can be done to dial the temperature down in the region? [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6385.36s)]
*  They can't have a nuclear weapon. Very simply. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6390.36s)]
*  They can't have a nuclear weapon. We're not going to allow that. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6393.36s)]
*  That's the President of the United States. He's only said that for 10 years. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6398.36s)]
*  For 10 years. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6403.36s)]
*  I would think Tulsi Gavriov would agree with him, [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6405.36s)]
*  since she was in Hiroshima surveying what happens when a nuclear, [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6408.36s)]
*  or in that case, an atomic bomb is dropped. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6413.36s)]
*  That she should be out front leading the charge. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6418.36s)]
*  She should have issued a video and said, [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6422.36s)]
*  That is why, by hook or by crook, we must prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6424.36s)]
*  But she hasn't put out a video like that. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6429.36s)]
*  Why? [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6433.36s)]
*  Let me also suggest that it's really a bad thing, [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6435.36s)]
*  having served in the Reagan administration and so forth, you know, the old timers. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6439.36s)]
*  It's really a bad thing, just like Chatsworth's father, by the way, [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6444.36s)]
*  when you have individuals, really when it comes to foreign policy, [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6450.36s)]
*  off there issuing their own videos and so forth like that, I don't really know. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6454.36s)]
*  I mean, I've never seen anything like that. Have you, Rich? [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6463.36s)]
*  I've literally never seen anything like that. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6468.36s)]
*  With the director of national intelligence as issuing a video like that, [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6471.36s)]
*  basically condemning the men and women who fought in World War II. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6474.36s)]
*  I've never seen anything like this. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etWC00uxEiQ&t=6480.36s)]
