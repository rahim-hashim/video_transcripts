Video Description: On Thursday’s Mark Levin Show, Sen Alex Padilla barging into a Kristi Noem press conference shows a pattern of violent, lawless behavior by Democrats. Democrats reflect their violent base and their violent base represents Democrats. Padilla could have coordinated with Noem instead of causing this show. The Democrat Party ​is ​a ​Marxist ​party ​that ​represents ​Islamists, antisemites, ​Stalinists, and ​criminals. ​ ​They've ​given ​up ​on ​the ​American ​citizens. Also, Representatives Elise Stefanik, Jim Jordan, Byron Donalds, and Nick Langworthy shined at a hearing on sanctuary states. They held Governors Kathy Hochul, JB Pritzker and Tim Walz to account. Later, a federal judge in San Francisco expressed skepticism about the constitutionality of President Trump’s order to deploy National Guard troops to Los Angeles to quell anti-ICE riots. The president has clear authority to federalize and deploy the National Guard, supported by statutes and precedent.  Afterward, Trump’s stance is clear: Iran must never get nuclear weapons. His 77 million voters heard him loud and clear—not the so-called “MAGA leaders” pushing isolationism. That’s not Trump; it’s Koch, Soros, and Rand Paul’s world, not his. He’s Reagan—peace through strength, not Bernie Sanders or Noam Chomsky. The isolationists dodge Iran’s threats, deny their nuclear ambitions, and blame Israel while ignoring the assassination attempt on Trump himself. Where’s their plan? Let Iran aim nukes at us? Blackmail our allies? They’ve got no answers, just tired Marxist rehashes and attacks on our history. If Trump acts to protect us, support him, our military, and, yes, Israel. Don’t smear him as abandoning MAGA—he’s keeping his promise. In addition, On Power explains that in his 1792 essay, James Madison explores the concept of property rights, expanding the term beyond mere physical possessions to include personal rights and freedoms. Property encompasses everything a person values and has a right to, such as opinions, religious beliefs, personal safety, liberty, and the free use of their faculties. Madison argues that a just government must protect all forms of property—both tangible and intangible—impartially.  Finally, in breaking news the Israeli Air Force has launched strikes on Iran, with explosions reported in Tehran. This was inevitable, Iran was never going to give up its nukes.

# Democrats Gone Wild: The New Era of Political Aggression
**The Mark Levin Show:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8)
*  Ladies and gentlemen, this next segment of the podcast is brought to you by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=0.0s)]
*  For over 50 years, the Great Heritage Foundation has been America's outpost in Washington, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4.8s)]
*  fighting against the D.C. federal bureaucracy and working to secure a future that allows Americans [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=9.52s)]
*  to live the good life. For too long, common sense principles have been ignored by many of the very [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=14.64s)]
*  leaders claiming to fight for America, but the Heritage Foundation is proud to hold our leaders [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=19.28s)]
*  accountable and stand up for America's founding principles, paid for by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=23.6s)]
*  He's here. Now, broadcasting from the underground command post, deep in the bowels of a hidden [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=30.48s)]
*  bunker, somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=38.0s)]
*  we once again make contact with our leader, Mark LeVein. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  Hello, America. Mark LeVein here, our number 877-381-3811, 877-381-3811. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=120.88s)]
*  Do you see these Democrats? This guy, Padilla, is a United States Senator in California. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=131.12s)]
*  He barges into a press conference. How physical they get. Like at the Newark Detention Center, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=138.48s)]
*  the ICE detention center, the Democrats barge their way in. They're physical. They're abusive. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=146.39999999999998s)]
*  We have a whole new generation of Democrats. I don't mean necessarily young, but necessarily [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=153.76s)]
*  violent. He could have contacted Noem and said he wanted to talk to her. He could have contacted [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=160.39999999999998s)]
*  Noem and said he wants to be at the press conference. If she says no, he can have his [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=167.04s)]
*  own press conference outside. She's tried to reach the governor. Governor no brains. Emma said [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=170.72s)]
*  no nuts. You know, I don't like to say that, Mr. Producer. I'm talking about peanuts. What do you [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=179.6s)]
*  think I'm talking about? But it's incredible, America. You understand the elected Democrats [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=184.16s)]
*  are violent like their constituents. They're lawless like their constituents. Then they march [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=194.24s)]
*  across the Capitol building. They look like a bunch of homeless people. They're marking across [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=201.76000000000002s)]
*  the Capitol building and we're confronting the Republican leadership. Confronting the Republican [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=207.52s)]
*  leadership over what? Now they're threatening if they take the House, they're going to gut ICE. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  So this is a Marxist party, as I've told you multiple times, that represents Islamists and [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=216.88s)]
*  anti-Semites. Obviously, Stalinists represents violent people, criminals. That's why they're [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=221.6s)]
*  always trying to get felons to vote, get them registered and vote. They've given up on the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=229.84s)]
*  American citizen. This is their constituency. So this guy, Senator Alex Padilla, he's trying to [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=236.24s)]
*  make, you know, and he does, a drama moment just like the governor there. You know, I think they're [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=244.0s)]
*  all from Hollywood. They're all wannabe failures of actors and actresses. It's one crackpot after [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=249.68s)]
*  another. So I don't know how good this will be handled in audio. He was removed and he was [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=259.12s)]
*  handcuffed. He didn't even have his identification card. He was arrested. He was arrested. He was [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  not even identified. They had no idea who he is. How dare you do this to a senator? And you know, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=273.44s)]
*  if you do it to a senator, you can do anything else. This is the elitist. This is the ruling class. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=277.44s)]
*  Let's give it a shot. Cut 18. Go. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=284.16s)]
*  I'm Senator Alex Padilla. I have a question for the secretary, because the fact of the matter is [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=286.16s)]
*  a half a dozen violent criminals that are rotating on your, on your hands off. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=292.4s)]
*  It's unbelievable. Unbelievable. I don't want to hear them talk about January 6th ever again. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=299.6s)]
*  Never again. Never again. Here he is at a press conference after crashing Nome's press conference [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=309.44s)]
*  today. Now he could have done this before. Cut 19. Go. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=316.40000000000003s)]
*  I'm here in Los Angeles today. And I was here in the federal building in the conference room, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=323.52s)]
*  awaiting a scheduled briefing from federal officials as part of my responsibility. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=331.36s)]
*  That's not what he did. You could see the video, right, Mr. Bidducer? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=337.6s)]
*  He wasn't sitting in the audience or anything of the sort. He was trying to break into the [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=341.6s)]
*  news conference. It had begun. And the door opens and he walks in like he's walking to the podium. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=346.4s)]
*  That's what I saw, Rich. Isn't that what you saw? He ran towards her. He ran towards her. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=353.28s)]
*  And of course, her security stopped him. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=359.84s)]
*  I mean, these people are horrendous. And what the Republicans should do in the Senate is take action [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=365.44s)]
*  against this man. They should take action because, you know, the Palestinian senator, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=372.64s)]
*  as the president rightly calls him, Schmuck Schumer, he goes to the floor of the Senate [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=377.76s)]
*  and he's indignant. He's indignant about what? It's just like the Democrats and the mayor of [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=383.03999999999996s)]
*  Newark. They're indignant. They're the ones who crash illegally, trespass, force their way in [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=389.12s)]
*  to the detention center, the ICE detention center. By the way, we have some great audio clips, don't [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=395.36s)]
*  we, Rich? Great clips, sanctuary policies. This Elise Stefanik is a superstar. Didn't she make [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=402.16s)]
*  mincemeat of the governor of New York, Mr. Producer Hokel? We have that here, don't we? Some of it [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=410.8s)]
*  anyway. Unbelievable. Rips her to shreds. But one thing at a time here. One thing at a time. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=417.28000000000003s)]
*  So the problem here is that the Democrats reflect their violent base and the violent base reflects [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=428.72s)]
*  the Democrats. And the violent base represents the judges too. I would ask the judges in Washington, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=433.28000000000003s)]
*  D.C. Are you okay with this judge in New Jersey who says Mahmoud Khalil can't be deported based [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=440.8s)]
*  on the Secretary of State's determination? You okay with that? Even though he was involved in [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=447.84000000000003s)]
*  multiple times as a leader of what turned out to be very violent activities at Columbia? And of course, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=453.2s)]
*  Reuters has said that he was a student. He wasn't a student any longer. Those are the doggies barking. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=459.92s)]
*  I love it when they bark. The problem is when they don't bark. The problem is when they don't bark. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=465.44s)]
*  Then you get a problem. We're going to take an early break here because I want to talk about [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=471.52s)]
*  this back and forth which was really historic. The House Committee having some of these governors [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=477.04s)]
*  in front of them and these Republicans really castigating them. We'll be right back. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=488.96000000000004s)]
*  Americans sent President Trump back to Washington with a mandate to solve the border crisis, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=502.16s)]
*  reverse the effects of Biden's inflation and restore American greatness. But at every turn, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=506.64s)]
*  judges are blocking President Trump's attempts to fulfill this mandate. The Heritage Foundation [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=511.44s)]
*  has been closely assessing the situation. They've been able to identify legal problems with these [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=516.0s)]
*  judges' actions and the solutions that will end this potential crisis. To see the results for [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=520.56s)]
*  yourself, go to heritage.org slash Levin. That's heritage.org slash L-E-V-I-N. There you'll get [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=525.6s)]
*  exclusive access to the Heritage Foundation's guide to solving the problem of judges limiting [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=531.68s)]
*  President Trump's moves. Stopping these judges could be the only way to protect Americans and [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=536.7199999999999s)]
*  take back our country. So go to heritage.org slash Levin. Heritage.org slash L-E-V-I-N. Get [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=541.3599999999999s)]

*  This was just too good, folks. So we're going to listen in on some of this because most of [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=553.76s)]
*  you are working during the day. Those of those who aren't, aren't listening to this program. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=566.3199999999999s)]
*  But I want you to hear some of this. I want you to hear Elise Stefanik at a hearing on sanctuary [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=573.36s)]
*  states. Sanctuary states. And she lets into Kathy Hochul, the current governor, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=578.32s)]
*  who she hopes to run against. And I hope she does because she would be a fantastic governor. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=584.8s)]
*  But this is, this is Stefanik. Cut 10, go. Governor Hochul, on your first day in office, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=590.96s)]
*  you signed executive order one. Is that correct? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=596.5600000000001s)]
*  I believe it is. And you extended this executive order not once, not twice, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=602.32s)]
*  but three times. Most recently, January 16th this year. Is that correct? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=607.28s)]
*  If that's what your facts show, I signed countless executive orders. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=611.92s)]
*  I would assume you know it's executive order one. And this is a continuation of your predecessor, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=615.68s)]
*  sanctuary state policies. Correct. Is included in that. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=620.4s)]
*  I want to be sure we are defining sanctuary state property. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=624.0s)]
*  I'll define it for you. It is the policy of the state that state officers or employees [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=626.8s)]
*  shall not disclose information to federal immigration authorities for the purpose of [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=631.1999999999999s)]
*  federal civil immigration enforcement. It goes on to say law enforcement officers may not use [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=635.12s)]
*  resources, equipment or personnel for the purpose of detecting and apprehending any [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=640.48s)]
*  individual suspected or. Ladies and gentlemen, this next segment of the podcast is brought to [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=645.36s)]

*  Now broadcasting from the underground command post, deep in the bowels of a hidden bunker [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=679.12s)]
*  somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building. We've once again made [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=685.04s)]
*  contact with our leader, Mark Levin. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=690.16s)]
*  Hello, America. Mark Levin here. Our number 877-381-3811. 877-381-3811. Do you see these [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=750.16s)]
*  Democrats? This guy, Paddy, is a United States senator in California. He barges into a press [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=778.16s)]
*  conference. How physical they get. Like at the Newark Detention Center, the ICE detention center, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=786.24s)]
*  the Democrats barge their way in. They're physical. They're abusive. We now have a whole new generation [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=794.16s)]
*  of Democrats. I don't mean necessarily young, but necessarily violent. He could have contacted [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=801.6s)]

*  press conference. If she says no, he can have his own press conference outside. She said she's tried [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=815.2s)]
*  to reach the governor. Governor no-brains. Emma said no nuts. You know, I don't like to say that, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=820.72s)]
*  Mr. Producer. I'm talking about peanuts. What do you think I'm talking about? But it's incredible, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=827.52s)]
*  America. You understand the elected Democrats are violent like their constituents. They're lawless [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=834.88s)]
*  like their constituents. Then they march across the Capitol building. They look like a bunch of [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=846.64s)]
*  homeless people. They're marching across the Capitol building and we're confronting the [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=852.96s)]
*  Republican leadership. Confronting the Republican leadership over what? Now they're threatening if [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=856.72s)]
*  they take the House, they're going to gut ICE. So this is a Marxist party, as I've told you multiple [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=861.9200000000001s)]

*  They've given up on the American citizen. This is their constituency. So this guy, Senator Alex [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=883.04s)]
*  Padilla, he's trying to make, you know, and he does, a drama moment just like the governor there. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=892.0799999999999s)]

*  It's one crackpot after another. So I don't know how good this will be handled in audio. He was [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=905.84s)]
*  removed and he was handcuffed. He didn't even have his identification. They had no idea who he is. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=915.6s)]
*  How dare you do this to a senator? And you know, if you do it to a senator, you can do anything else. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=919.76s)]
*  This is the elitist. This is the ruling class. Let's give it a shot. Cut 18, go. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=923.6s)]

*  That's not what he did. You could see the video, right, Mr. Producer? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=984.0s)]
*  He wasn't sitting in the audience or anything of the sort. He was trying to break into the news [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=988.0s)]
*  conference. It had begun and the door opens and he walks in like he's walking to the podium. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=993.04s)]

*  And of course her security stopped him. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1006.24s)]
*  I mean these people are horrendous. And what the Republicans should do in the [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1011.8399999999999s)]

*  of the Senate and he's indignant. He's indignant about what? It's just like the Democrats and the [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1028.96s)]
*  mayor of Newark. They're indignant. They're the ones who crash illegally, trespass, force their [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1035.2s)]
*  way in to the detention center, the ICE detention center. By the way, we have some great [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1040.96s)]
*  audio clips, don't we, Rich? Great clips, sanctuary policies. This Elise Stefanik is a superstar. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1047.76s)]
*  Didn't she make mincemeat of the governor of New York, Mr. Producer, Hokel? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1056.5600000000002s)]
*  We have that here, don't we? Some of it anyway. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1060.88s)]

*  So the problem here is that the Democrats reflect their violent base and the violent base reflects [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1078.0800000000002s)]
*  the Democrats. And the violent base represents the judges, too. I would ask the judges in Washington, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1083.1200000000001s)]

*  The House committee having some of these governors in front of them [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1133.52s)]

*  states. Sanctuary states. And she lets into Kathy Hochul, the current governor, who she hopes to [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1224.64s)]
*  run against. And I hope she does because she would be a fantastic governor. But this is, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1231.92s)]
*  is Stefanik. Cut 10. Go. Governor Hochul, on your first day in office, you signed executive order [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1238.56s)]
*  one. Is that correct? I believe it is. And you extended this executive order not once, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1244.48s)]
*  not twice, but three times. Most recently, January 16th this year. Is that correct? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1252.8s)]
*  If that's what your facts show, I signed countless executive orders. I would assume you'd know it's [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1258.32s)]
*  executive order one. And this is a continuation of your predecessor sanctuary state policies, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1263.1999999999998s)]
*  correct? Is included in that. I want to be sure we are defining sanctuary state property. I'll [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1268.1599999999999s)]
*  define it for you. It is the policy of the state that state officers or employees shall not disclose [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1273.28s)]
*  information to federal immigration authorities for the purpose of federal civil immigration [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1278.56s)]

*  state of New York to take any policy action solely because the person is an undocumented alien. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1298.08s)]
*  That's a quote in your executive orders that you extended. Now, do you know who Sekir Akan is? [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1303.4399999999998s)]
*  I want to get back to the first part of your question. No, I'm asking a question. Do you know [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1309.6s)]
*  who Sekir Akan is? I want to make sure you understand that this simply says that we will [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1312.32s)]
*  cooperate with ICE. No, it does not say that. I read what it says. And let me talk to you about [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1318.1599999999999s)]
*  the results. Do you know who Sekir Akan is? You should as the governor of New York state. Do you [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1322.24s)]
*  know? Refresh my recollection. He was an illegal migrant in New York. And do you know what crime [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1327.12s)]
*  he committed in addition to being here legally? No, I do not. You do not? This was widely reported. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1332.96s)]
*  He found a 15 year old girl, threatened her with a metal pole, told her to get into the back seat of [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1338.48s)]

*  Sebastian Zapita Khalil is? I'm sure you'll tell me there's many cases whether they're high profile [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1349.84s)]
*  cases. New Yorkers know about them and you don't. So let's talk about Sebastian Zapita Khalil. Do you [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1355.92s)]
*  know who that is? I don't have the specific details at my disposal. No. Well, this is an illegal [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1361.92s)]
*  migrant in New York because of your sanctuary state policies. Do you know what crime he committed? [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1367.28s)]

*  sleeping woman on the subway, lit her on fire and burned her alive. This is in Kathy Hockels, New York. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1378.24s)]
*  And as I'm sure you are aware, and I'll remind you, that ICE issued an order to detain this violent [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1385.3600000000001s)]
*  criminal, but that was rejected by New York officials due to sanctuary state laws. Now, do you [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1391.2s)]
*  know who Raymond Rojas Basilio is? I just want to say this. These crimes are horrific. Because of [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1397.6s)]
*  your sanctuary state policies. In all of these cases we would work with ICE to remove them. You [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1404.8799999999999s)]

*  you this. I will explain to you the policies of New York. We cooperate with, I know you're just trying to. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1420.9599999999998s)]

*  alive on the New York subways in Kathy Hockels, New York. So I will keep on going. What about [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1433.36s)]

*  because again of your sanctuary state policies. This illegal was shielded from federal immigration [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1450.56s)]
*  enforcement and able to commit this heinous crime. And what about Wilson Castillo Diaz? Do you know [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1455.92s)]
*  who that is? I am telling you this. We do cooperate fully with ICE and criminal prosecution. Our sanctuary [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1462.3200000000002s)]
*  regulations only deal with civil enforcement. You're not advocating for these victims. This is a five-year-old who was raped [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1469.2s)]
*  on Long Island in Nassau County. You are not advocating on behalf of these victims. You are [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1473.6000000000001s)]
*  shielding illegals. Even in your opening statement, you prioritize putting illegals first. That is not true. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1479.6000000000001s)]
*  This is rapes of young girls, beatings of NYPD cops by illegals who are here under Kathy Hockels failed policies, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1484.96s)]

*  That wasn't the question. I just read your statement. I can read your statement. Who is Jesus Romero Hernandez? [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1559.68s)]
*  I don't have the details on every single person in the state of 20 million people. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1564.96s)]
*  I understand, but this guy is a citizen of Mexico, deported seven times, came to your state, assaulted one of your residents with a machete, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1570.0800000000002s)]
*  choked a police officer, then when he was in custody, assaulted a corrections officer. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1575.8400000000001s)]
*  ICE finds out this guy is in your state's custody and they send you a detainer. You're familiar with a detainer, right? [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1580.5600000000002s)]
*  Yes, I am. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1586.24s)]
*  Notice of action immigration detainer to Tompkins County Jail from Syracuse Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1587.04s)]
*  Section one, they check a couple boxes. The first one they check is a final order of removal against the alien has taken place. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1595.12s)]
*  That means a court has said this guy needs to go. This machete wielding, cop choking, corrections officer assaulting guy needs to go. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1603.28s)]
*  Then they also check another box and they say biometric confirmation of who this individual is, this alien's identity. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1612.56s)]
*  So they got the right guy and a court has said he needs to go. Any idea what Tompkins County Jail decided to do with that detainer order? [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1618.32s)]
*  I will tell you this. The state of the... [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1629.3600000000001s)]

*  Those, the descriptions you have put forth are absolutely chilling and disturbing and reprehensible to all of us. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1635.6s)]
*  Which is why I'm asking you the question. What did Tompkins County do? [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1642.72s)]
*  What I have responsibility for are state courts, state police. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1647.92s)]
*  We cannot and will not hold Mr. Hernandez. We can't keep the machete guy who would choke the police officer and assault the corrections officer. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1651.12s)]
*  We can't keep him. In fact, we have the back and forth from Tompkins County and ICE on January 28th of this year. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1659.76s)]
*  8.56 p.m. Tompkins County tells ICE we're not going to hold this guy. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1668.16s)]
*  Seven minutes later ICE responds back. We will be there to take custody this evening. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1673.6000000000001s)]
*  24 minutes later Thompson County reiterates we're not going to have him. We're not going to turn him over. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1680.96s)]
*  10.45. ICE arrives at the jail. One hour and 18 minutes later and guess what? [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1686.64s)]
*  Mr. Hernandez is not there. They couldn't wait one hour and 18 minutes for a guy who assaulted one of your residents with a machete, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1694.16s)]
*  choked the police officer, and then went in custody, assaulted corrections officers. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1701.68s)]
*  That is sanctuary policy in a nutshell and that is what your state supports and so do these other governments. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1706.16s)]
*  That is what is so wrong why the American people hate this concept. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1711.6000000000001s)]

*  We have turned over 1300 people. You disagree with it? We turn over 1300 people. Does your [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1720.24s)]
*  make the wrong call? Those are local policies that we would not have done in the state of New York. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1725.28s)]
*  State of New York that is a local decision. So you're saying this is wrong. I would say this if it happened in a state prison we have already turned over 1300 people. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1730.96s)]
*  Sheriff of Tompkins County is a Democrat and Republican. There have been times. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1738.6399999999999s)]

*  I'm asking for this moment to explain that I'm sometimes waiting for ICE to come pick up people. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1751.52s)]
*  I'm asking is he a Democrat or Republican and do you agree with the actions he took? [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1759.76s)]
*  Do you agree with the actions he took? How about that question? They are in conflict with the [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1761.52s)]
*  what the state of New York would do. Well maybe they're scared. By the way he is a Democrat, [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1765.1200000000001s)]
*  Democrat, Sheriff. Maybe the county guys are a little scared because you said this. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1769.36s)]
*  I'm quoting from it looks like the New York Times. We all know you can trust them. This is just this is this is last month, May 25th. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1773.28s)]
*  You said we have some counties that are renegade counties and work with ICE. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1781.04s)]
*  Maybe they're nervous of being called a renegade county. Yeah they have her pinned to the wall. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1785.9199999999998s)]

*  Folks are you concerned about the growing number of judges blocking President Trump's executive orders? [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1793.28s)]
*  Well if you're not you should be. Every time a nationwide injunction is handed down by one of these judges it's the American people who lose. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1798.7199999999998s)]

*  Call in now 877-381-3811. All right Byron Donald's at the hearing today dealing with Illinois's phony governor J.P. Pritzker and Hokel. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1850.32s)]
*  Governor Pritzker how much does the state of Illinois spend on illegal immigration every year? [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1870.32s)]
*  Again illegal immigration that's a federal responsibility they could tell how much is wasted as a result of their failures. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1878.32s)]
*  Governor don't you keep track of how many people are on your Medicaid rolls, how many people who are illegal immigrants in the state of Illinois who are getting actually benefits in your state doesn't your government keep track of that? [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1886.32s)]
*  They don't get Medicaid in Illinois or any state as far as I know. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1896.32s)]
*  Governor Pritzker you do not keep track of any public service dollars in the state of Illinois that goes to illegal immigrants or goes to people in your state who are not legal residents of the United States and of the state of Illinois you don't keep track of that? [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1900.32s)]
*  We absolutely keep track of our budget we're very closely and in fact it's been balanced for seven years in a row unlike the Republican before me. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1912.32s)]
*  You know it's interesting I noticed that in the state of Illinois you guys don't really keep track of your money because I asked your mayor in Chicago a similar question about a month ago and he didn't have an answer. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1920.32s)]
*  It was quite interesting I think this might be an Illinois problem. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1930.32s)]
*  Governor Hokel in your state you are spending about roughly four billion dollars on illegal immigration and at the same time you are actually asking the federal government for four billion dollars to finish Penn Station. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1933.32s)]
*  Don't you think it would be better to stop funding illegal immigrants in your state and actually use those resources to finish Penn Station as opposed to coming to the federal government for the money? [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1945.32s)]
*  Penn Station is owned by Amtrak not by the state so it's an appropriate use of their dollars and Donald Trump has agreed to spend upwards of seven billion dollars I appreciated that very much. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1956.32s)]
*  What we spend on immigrants the immigrants who are here hard working to live a life and working on our farms and taking care of our parents in nursing homes and taking care of our children they have been coming here for 400 years and we don't keep track of individuals based on their status. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1968.32s)]
*  We make sure that people have services so we don't end up with an unexpected. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1985.32s)]
*  So essentially what you're telling me is that you keep no track of money that is going to people who are not legal in the United States resources that are taken away from New Yorkers resources that are taken away from Illinoisans you guys do not keep track of any of this. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=1990.32s)]
*  You know what's really challenging is that many people came here with legal status I mean temporary protective status 300,000. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2003.32s)]
*  Do you do you do you do you go along with the strategy from the Biden administration which massively expanded immigration protocols that overwhelmed your city and overwhelmed your state do you agree with that we call for secure borders we call for this body I never remember you calling for secure borders at all Governor Hogan. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2010.32s)]
*  We have many conversations I had with the White House we asked for federal resources I mean you're putting a federal problem on our laps and you know what gets old after a while I wish you would just do your job if your party actually do the job of securing the nation securing the nation the way President Trump has not had to do twice. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2028.32s)]
*  We wouldn't be in this predicament wouldn't you agree. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2046.32s)]
*  You're you agree or disagree that's not during the nation's borders is the job of the president of the United States President Trump has done that job twice now well and previous Democrat presidents have not done that job wouldn't you agree with that this has been a problem that's been in place since I was a young staffer here on Capitol Hill we worked on immigration and Ronald Reagan signed amnesty for 3 million people you know it's interesting you bring a Reagan Reagan's amnesty in 86 you know part of that deal was to actually build border war and secure it the Democrat Party refuses to build border while you oppose it every single time. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2050.32s)]
*  Is that your right there finally somebody and Byron does it the deal was it was 2.3 million illegal aliens. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2079.32s)]
*  And Reagan was very very hesitant to do this and he demanded that they secure the border including the building of a wall the Democrats agreed and then they lied. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2089.32s)]
*  It's that simple it's what they did this guy Mitchell he was I believe the majority leader from Maine he was a real sinister vile human being in my humble opinion but that's what they did. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2099.32s)]
*  You know like the Iranians go ahead. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2112.32s)]
*  Times when bipartisan legislation presented to this body and people just walk away from it they refuse to do the hard work of governing like governors like us have to do every single funny you know you compare her to a guy like the Santas. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2116.32s)]
*  You don't hear this kind of crap from the Santas he puts his foot down he secures his border he deports or sense to ice works with ice to deport individuals who shouldn't be in a state he does those sorts of things they're saying. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2129.32s)]
*  Feds need to get their act together here we have a president who not only has his act together is actually putting his foot down and these governors oppose him this guy Pritzker is a lonesome sob. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2143.32s)]
*  Hokel is an incompetent buffoon. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2153.32s)]
*  And then there's wall sitting up there like the clown that he is. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2156.32s)]
*  You notice they don't they don't embrace their radicalism on this issue they want open borders. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2161.32s)]
*  They want illegal aliens to use the services that are really supposed to be reserved for citizens that is taxpayers. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2167.32s)]
*  They don't come out and say what they're for they pretended somebody else's fault it's nobody else's fault they're the governor. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2175.32s)]
*  It's not anybody else's fault Biden was president it's his fault. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2183.32s)]
*  The Democrats had control it's their fault and Trump has done everything possible and he has secured the border he's trying to deport these bad people and he's got Democrats violently attacking ice violently trying to break themselves into a press conference. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2188.32s)]
*  He's got Democrat militia Democrat illegal aliens Democrat Islamist Democrat Marxist all over our country violently rioting trying to overthrow our country burning the American flag carrying the flag of the American people. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2201.32s)]

*  We know what's going on. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2222.32s)]
*  Let's move to cut again nine Mr. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2226.32s)]
*  Badoo to go. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2229.32s)]
*  You've been sitting over there pretty quiet I got a question for you. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2230.32s)]
*  I love to talk thank you. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2233.32s)]
*  Fair enough. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2235.32s)]
*  You said earlier that the ice agents under under the orders of President Trump or a modern day Gestapo. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2237.32s)]
*  Do you realize how disgusting a phrase that is considering the history of Nazi Germany. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2243.32s)]
*  Would you like to recant that statement. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2248.32s)]
*  What I said Congressman and I have a long history of supporting law enforcement I said President Trump was using them as his modern day Gestapo not identifying who you are coming up and unmarked bands taking people away and giving is it the responsibility of ice. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2250.32s)]
*  Let's stop for a second. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2264.32s)]
*  That's the way it works. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2265.32s)]
*  You don't have to say hi I'm here from ice. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2269.32s)]
*  I want to introduce myself and the mask is off. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2272.32s)]

*  Oh you're Frank Smith. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2277.32s)]
*  Yeah it's a dangerous job being an ice agent. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2278.32s)]
*  It's enormously dangerous particularly when they're going after criminals that are going after illegal aliens. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2282.32s)]
*  They don't know a damn thing about them because they haven't been vetted. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2286.32s)]
*  It is a very dangerous job and to see this fat ass sitting there talking about what they're acting like the Gestapo. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2289.32s)]
*  No they're not acting like the Gestapo. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2296.32s)]
*  They're being removed from the country. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2298.32s)]
*  They're not being sent to death camps you jackass. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2299.32s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2304.32s)]
*  Illegal aliens in the United States who are here isn't that their responsibility. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2305.32s)]
*  Yes it is Congressman except that the Constitution is not an inconvenience. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2310.32s)]
*  It's not an either or. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2314.32s)]
*  Nobody said an anger and you have a responsibility to deport illegal aliens and the president is going through that process right now. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2315.32s)]
*  Excuse me they had federal warrants. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2323.32s)]
*  They had federal warrants to remove these people. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2325.32s)]
*  They had federal review process. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2327.32s)]
*  They're like numbskulls. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2329.32s)]
*  They got their phrases they have their name and their words ready through due process. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2332.32s)]
*  They had due process. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2337.32s)]
*  There are federal warrants for their arrest and removal. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2339.32s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2343.32s)]
*  This administration they abused every process there is under border laws to allow more than 10 million people into the country illegally. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2345.32s)]
*  And this is a burden on all Americans. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2354.32s)]
*  And so the president is doing his job. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2356.32s)]
*  So what is sick to refer to Americans who are ICE agents as Gestapo governor. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2358.32s)]
*  You're wrong. You need to apologize to these agents. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2365.32s)]
*  They're doing their jobs. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2367.32s)]
*  They are Americans. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2368.32s)]
*  They serve this country with honor and decency and respect. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2369.32s)]
*  Do not diminish their work simply because you tried to make a cheap point that you could tweet. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2373.32s)]
*  I want to play one more. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2379.32s)]
*  Nick Langworthy Republican of New York. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2381.32s)]
*  Look, I could be playing this all night. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2385.32s)]
*  They were fantastic. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2387.32s)]
*  And I want to salute the Republicans on this committee for what they did. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2388.32s)]
*  This is a very good committee. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2391.32s)]
*  You know, they also dealt with these college presidents and university. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2394.32s)]
*  Let me put it to you this way. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2398.32s)]
*  Any committee at least the phonics is on is a good committee. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2400.32s)]
*  I'm just saying I'm a big fan. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2402.32s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2406.32s)]
*  Nick Langworthy, Republican of New York, cut 11. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2407.32s)]
*  Go. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2410.32s)]
*  Governor Hokel, yes or no. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2411.32s)]
*  Do you think someone who's committed murder or rape in this country in their here illegally should have tools at their disposal to avoid deportation? [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2412.32s)]
*  As the governor, it's a primary responsibility is to ask for no question. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2422.32s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2427.32s)]
*  They're a pornd. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2428.32s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2429.32s)]
*  Whatever response you prepared to give today dwarfs in comparison to your actions as governor. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2430.32s)]
*  I would like to remind you of someone named Gianfranco Torres Navarro, an illegal alien and suspected leader of a violent Peruvian gang. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2434.32s)]
*  He was tied to 23 murders in Peru and came to this country illegally across the southern border. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2443.32s)]
*  He had his victims faces tattooed on his body and he was hiding in plain sight in Endicott, New York for an extended period of time where ice could not locate him. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2450.32s)]
*  And why did it take so long to find him? [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2461.32s)]
*  Because policies like your green light law, which blocks ice in U.S. Border Patrol from accessing critical DMV databases. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2464.32s)]
*  In fact, it threatens the badges and threatens to charge with felonies any officer that shares that DMV data with federal agents. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2475.32s)]
*  These agents rely on data to be able to know who they're pulling over on the side of the road. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2486.32s)]
*  They're taking their lives into their hands every time they're trying to keep our streets safe. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2492.32s)]
*  The really sick irony here is that your government in New York, my home state, freely shares that same DMV data with the government of Canada at our bridges in you and my hometown. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2498.32s)]
*  But it doesn't share that data with your American federal government. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2513.32s)]
*  Why, Governor? [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2517.32s)]
*  You're misstating the green light law because we are able to cooperate with federal authorities when there's a crime involved. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2522.32s)]
*  Why do you shield the database, Governor? [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2528.32s)]
*  Anything they want from us related to investigating a crime is available to them. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2531.32s)]
*  This is data that's needed in real time to enforce the laws on the streets. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2535.32s)]
*  They can't subpoena these records from your government. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2540.32s)]
*  And I've had these conversations with my county sheriffs all across the state of New York, state police. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2543.32s)]
*  They want to work with the federal officials. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2551.32s)]
*  They want to clean up these messes. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2553.32s)]
*  But they can't because they are being threatened by you and our attorney general that they'll take away their badge and end their careers. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2555.32s)]
*  Countless, countless instances where we've cooperated with federal law enforcement happens on a daily basis. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2561.32s)]
*  And so your characterization is just incorrect of how we provide information to people who ask for it. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2567.32s)]
*  You share the database in its entirety with Canada, but you don't share it with the federal government. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2573.32s)]
*  It's just it's beyond belief. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2579.32s)]
*  I mean, this is denial and excuses, Governor. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2582.32s)]
*  You know damn well that the New York State Sheriff's Association, the State Association of Chiefs of Police have both condemned the green light law. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2584.32s)]
*  Sheriffs from Erie County, Niagara County, Monroe, Albany, Broome, Dutchess and Oneida counties, multiple parties. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2591.32s)]
*  All right, we get the point. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2597.32s)]
*  And she's a buffoon. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2598.32s)]
*  And again, I want to congratulate the Republicans on this committee for doing a hell of a job. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2602.32s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2606.32s)]
*  Mud Love End. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2607.32s)]
*  American sent President Trump back to Washington with a mandate to solve the border crisis, reverse the effects of Biden's inflation and restore American greatness. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2615.32s)]
*  But at every turn, judges are blocking President Trump's attempts to fulfill this mandate. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2623.32s)]
*  The Heritage Foundation has been closely assessing the situation. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2628.32s)]
*  They've been able to identify legal problems with these judges actions and the solutions that will end this potential crisis. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2631.32s)]

*  First time at least since my injury. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2676.32s)]
*  He's a good guy. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2679.32s)]
*  He said, I don't want you doing extra work. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2682.32s)]
*  I don't want you doing this. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2684.32s)]
*  I don't want you doing that. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2685.32s)]
*  I said, honestly, I'm doing great. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2686.32s)]
*  It's up to you. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2687.32s)]
*  So I will be on tonight. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2688.32s)]
*  I do not do a lot of the Fox shows. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2690.32s)]
*  I love all the hosts. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2693.32s)]
*  They're all fantastic. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2694.32s)]
*  That's not why. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2695.32s)]
*  It's just that I'm so busy throughout the day and night. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2696.32s)]
*  I'm doing a radio program. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2698.32s)]
*  But we appreciate them. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2701.32s)]
*  All right. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2703.32s)]
*  This federal judge in San Francisco calls your head to spin. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2704.32s)]
*  Remember, we talked about it before. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2707.32s)]
*  Charles Breyer, Stephen Breyer's younger brother, Stephen Breyer, the former associate justice of the Supreme Court. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2708.32s)]
*  Federal judge writes the New York Post expressed skepticism today about the constitutionality of Trump's order to deploy thousands of [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2717.32s)]
*  national guard troops to L.A. to quell an anti-ice riot. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2725.32s)]
*  This is black and white. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2728.32s)]
*  I don't know what this judge is fumbling around for. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2730.32s)]
*  Senior San Francisco U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer heard arguments from attorneys for Trump's Justice Department in California, Governor Newsom, [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2733.32s)]
*  after the Democrat had sued the feds over dispatching roughly 4,000 guard members to protect officers carrying out immigration and enforcement operations. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2741.32s)]
*  You know, in the past, governors wouldn't bring lawsuits, but now they have their favorite judges all over the place and they give it a shot. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2750.32s)]
*  They give it a shot. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2756.32s)]
*  And so the fact that a lawsuit is brought and not dismissed out of hand is really an abomination in a case like this. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2758.32s)]
*  We're talking about the president exercising his authority and the president is, of course, limited, Breyer said. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2767.32s)]
*  That's the difference between a constitutional government and King George. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2773.32s)]
*  I'm sick of these guys lecturing us like we're third graders using really stupid statements. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2778.32s)]
*  Brett Shoemate, the head of DOJ's Civil Division, disputed Breyer's characterization of the president's order throughout the hour-long hearing, [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2784.32s)]
*  arguing the commander-in-chief had delegated the federalizing of the guard through California's adjunct general as legally required. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2793.32s)]
*  He also claimed that Newsom was merely a conduit for that order as it passed through the chain of command from Trump to Defense Secretary Pete Hegsett to the state guard. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2801.32s)]
*  He said, there's no constitutional requirement, pre-approved requirement. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2810.32s)]
*  There's one commander-in-chief of the armed forces. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2814.32s)]
*  That's exactly right. Who cares who it passed through? [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2816.32s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2820.32s)]
*  The California attorney general's office counted that allowing Trump action to stand implied there would be no guardrails for further abuse by the executive branch. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2822.32s)]
*  There is no abuse by the executive branch. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2829.32s)]
*  This is the way it's worked over God knows how long since there's been a National Guard. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2831.32s)]
*  The president by fiat can federalize the National Guard and deploy it, the attorney for Newsom said, whenever there is disobedience to an order. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2837.32s)]
*  While Breyer took issue with the deployment of the National Guard, he appeared more inclined to let stand Trump's orders sending around 700 U.S. Marines to the Golden State to assist with the federal immigration crackdown. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2846.32s)]
*  He said, I don't understand how I'm supposed to do anything with the Marines to tell you the truth, the judge said. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2857.32s)]
*  Breyer did not immediately issue a ruling, but said he hoped to put one out very soon. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2863.32s)]
*  Geez, I tell you, it's very simple. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2868.32s)]
*  The president can do both. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2871.32s)]
*  The National Guard federalize it and send the Marines. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2873.32s)]
*  I've read the statute. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2876.32s)]
*  I read some of it to you. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2878.32s)]
*  There's simply no doubt about it. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2880.32s)]
*  Also the precedent behind it. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2882.32s)]
*  The fact that it is amazing what these federal judges now entertain. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2884.32s)]
*  All of a sudden, they're very interested in what third parties have to say and what states have to say. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2890.32s)]
*  And yet when the Democrats are in charge, they don't want to hear from third parties. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2894.32s)]
*  They have no standing and they don't want to hear from states under federal. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2898.32s)]
*  They don't want to hear anything. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2900.32s)]
*  They don't want to hear anything. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2902.32s)]
*  So what's going on with Iran and the United States and Israel? [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2904.32s)]
*  It's hard to read the tea leaves, isn't it? [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2908.32s)]
*  It's hard to tell. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2912.32s)]
*  We've moved personnel out of the parts of the danger zone, apparently. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2917.32s)]
*  But that could be for a number of reasons. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2923.32s)]
*  It could be a head fake. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2925.32s)]
*  Or it could be because something's going to happen. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2926.32s)]
*  But I want to read something to you that I posted when we return. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2932.32s)]
*  Because I've had about enough of these self-appointed leaders of MAGA. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2937.32s)]
*  77 million people voted for Donald Trump. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2943.32s)]
*  Of all backgrounds, all beliefs, all faiths. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2946.32s)]
*  And to have people whose names are unknown to 76,990,000 of them. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2950.32s)]
*  Claiming that they're leaders of MAGA is really kind of repulsive. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2958.32s)]
*  I'll be right back. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2961.32s)]

*  We've once again made contact with our leader. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=2997.32s)]

*  You know Mr. Producer. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3013.32s)]
*  Maybe I'll do a little video tonight here Mark. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3015.32s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3019.32s)]
*  Oh not that kind of video. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3020.32s)]
*  My book showed up. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3024.32s)]
*  The galley form which is the pre-formal form but it's very cool. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3026.32s)]
*  And I know you're going to love this book. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3032.32s)]
*  On Power. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3034.32s)]
*  And so maybe I'll just do a little video. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3036.32s)]
*  Show you the book. Cover the book. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3038.32s)]
*  My face. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3041.32s)]
*  Oh yeah yeah yeah I know. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3043.32s)]
*  Don't worry about that. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3045.32s)]
*  But. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3046.32s)]
*  It's so cool. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3048.32s)]
*  And Mr. Producer and I have been working on the audio. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3049.32s)]
*  We've got one more session. Right Rich? [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3051.32s)]
*  And you said you're liking it. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3055.32s)]
*  That's good. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3057.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3058.32s)]
*  Well we're not sure what's going to happen. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3062.32s)]
*  With Iran right now. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3064.32s)]
*  But I am sure of this. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3067.32s)]
*  There is a hyper intensive campaign. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3068.32s)]
*  By the isolationists to let Iran get a nuclear weapon. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3072.32s)]
*  I'm just telling you the truth. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3077.32s)]
*  Chatsborne. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3080.32s)]
*  Katarelson is. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3082.32s)]
*  No doubt burning up the. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3085.32s)]
*  His cell phone. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3087.32s)]
*  Maybe as a burner phone don't you think. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3088.32s)]
*  Probably throws it away. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3090.32s)]
*  Just so his fingerprints aren't on everything. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3091.32s)]
*  At the White House with. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3095.32s)]
*  Probably with JD I'm just guessing. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3098.32s)]
*  Maybe with. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3101.32s)]
*  Gabby over there. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3103.32s)]
*  Gabby. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3105.32s)]
*  And perhaps with the president. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3107.32s)]
*  I don't have any idea. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3108.32s)]
*  He's free to do it. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3109.32s)]
*  And I don't claim to know what he discusses. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3112.32s)]
*  You know I don't do it. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3114.32s)]
*  He does. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3115.32s)]
*  That's all right. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3116.32s)]
*  This is really pretty clear. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3118.32s)]
*  Either you understand. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3120.32s)]
*  The danger that Iran is. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3122.32s)]
*  Or. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3125.32s)]
*  You attack your fellow countrymen. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3126.32s)]
*  So I was reading you know Breitbart is one of my favorite websites. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3129.32s)]
*  No question about it. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3132.32s)]
*  And Alex who runs the thing is absolutely fantastic. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3133.32s)]
*  And. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3138.32s)]
*  Policco over there does a fantastic job too. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3140.32s)]
*  They all do really. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3142.32s)]
*  And so there was an article there. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3145.32s)]
*  About the so-called leaders. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3147.32s)]
*  Or influencers of MAGA. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3150.32s)]
*  And I got to thinking about it. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3152.32s)]
*  And who would they be other than the president. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3153.32s)]
*  Who are they. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3156.32s)]
*  Self appointed individuals who claim to represent 77 million of us. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3158.32s)]
*  The people who elected Donald Trump. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3162.32s)]
*  Very diverse group of people. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3163.32s)]
*  He united us all. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3166.32s)]
*  They don't represent me. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3168.32s)]
*  They don't represent. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3169.32s)]
*  If I were to put their names out there. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3170.32s)]
*  Nobody even would know who the hell they are. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3173.32s)]
*  So let's not play games. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3178.32s)]
*  So I posted. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3182.32s)]
*  This is not about. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3184.32s)]
*  Uniparty or neocons or old ways or the rest of the world. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3185.32s)]
*  Or is it correct to claim. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3190.32s)]
*  That these folks represent all those who voted for President Trump. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3191.32s)]
*  Our leaders. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3196.32s)]
*  77 million of us voted for Trump. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3198.32s)]
*  The vast majority of whom don't know our so-called MAGA leaders. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3200.32s)]
*  A very diverse population of voters. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3205.32s)]
*  Simply false self-righteousness. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3208.32s)]
*  That said I like certain of these folks. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3212.32s)]
*  I truly do. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3214.32s)]
*  The demand that he abandoned it is not MAGA. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3215.32s)]
*  It's isolationist. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3218.32s)]
*  Which he has never been. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3220.32s)]
*  It's the Koch and Soros world. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3221.32s)]
*  Two billionaires who hate Trump and opposed his elections. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3223.32s)]
*  It's the Rand Paul world who refused to endorse Trump until months after he won the election. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3226.32s)]
*  Trump has never identified with the isolationists. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3232.32s)]
*  Their projection changes every day. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3236.32s)]
*  The only thing that's left to do is to get rid of them. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3239.32s)]
*  He has never identified with the isolationists. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3241.32s)]
*  Their projection changes nothing. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3244.32s)]
*  He said repeatedly. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3246.32s)]
*  Iran must never get a nuclear weapon. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3247.32s)]
*  Those who voted for him heard him. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3250.32s)]
*  He was and is abundantly clear. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3252.32s)]
*  What did the isolationists think he meant? [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3254.32s)]
*  He's not one of them. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3257.32s)]
*  He never has been. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3258.32s)]
*  His first term further demonstrates this. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3260.32s)]
*  POTUS will decide on what steps to take to keep our country safe. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3263.32s)]
*  He has shown he will use prudence, not ideology. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3268.32s)]
*  He's more Reagan. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3271.32s)]
*  Peace through strength. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3273.32s)]
*  That's a Reagan line. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3274.32s)]
*  Make America great again. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3275.32s)]
*  Originally from the Reagan campaign. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3276.32s)]
*  The isolationists are more, well, Bernie Sanders and Noam Chomsky. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3278.32s)]
*  I remind them that Iran is the enemy. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3282.32s)]
*  Not common sense MAGA conservatives like you and me. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3285.32s)]
*  With all the isolationists chest beating, and that's pretty much what it is, [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3289.32s)]
*  It would be great if they would lay out their plan for dealing with a nuclear Iran [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3293.32s)]
*  that continuously threatens us rather than smearing and sloganeering those who find their ideology dangerous and irrational. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3298.32s)]
*  Denying Iran is pursuing these weapons. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3306.32s)]
*  Blaming Israel and the rest of it. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3310.32s)]
*  Can Iran do whatever it wishes? [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3313.32s)]
*  Build nuclear missiles and aim them at our country? [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3315.32s)]
*  Provide nuclear devices to other countries and terrorist regimes? [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3318.32s)]
*  Is that okay? [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3321.32s)]
*  Use their nuclear weapons to blackmail and threaten us and our interests? [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3322.32s)]
*  Is there any line at all? [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3326.32s)]
*  Should we wait until the terrorists' death to America Islamist police state has its nuclear weapons to find out? [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3329.32s)]
*  Then what? [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3335.32s)]
*  It's too late then, isn't it? [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3336.32s)]
*  Now remind the isolationists and our so-called MAGA leaders. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3339.32s)]
*  This is the Islamist regime that attempted to assassinate our MAGA president. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3343.32s)]
*  Or is that false information too? [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3347.32s)]
*  It's time for the isolationists to stop bashing our history with reckless broadsides and step up and lay it out. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3350.32s)]
*  Their plan for the present and going forward, not in generalities, [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3358.32s)]
*  or perverse attacks on the heroes who defeated Imperial Japan, or our nation's great founders. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3363.32s)]
*  We're going to abandon their foreign policy, so said one of them. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3369.32s)]
*  But transparent details, this so-called new way of looking at things, sounds pretty damn old and lame to me. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3374.32s)]
*  If they know how to reinvent the world, as if they're Karl Marx, then show us more. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3382.32s)]
*  And I want to take a good look, don't you? [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3387.32s)]
*  And if our MAGA president does take action, then how about supporting him in our military? [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3392.32s)]
*  And yes, dare I say, our ally Israel? [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3396.32s)]
*  But for crying out loud, don't accuse him of abandoning MAGA by projecting your own isolationism onto him. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3399.32s)]
*  He's upholding a crucially important campaign promise. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3406.32s)]
*  No nuclear weapons for Iran. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3410.32s)]
*  I can spell it out in Farsi, so our friend Chatsworth Katarosin can understand it. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3414.32s)]
*  Or maybe I'll go to the Qataris and they can send them a note and let them know. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3422.32s)]
*  Maybe I can do that. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3426.32s)]
*  And here's the other thing. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3432.32s)]
*  It's one thing to debate the best way to protect us from Iran. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3434.32s)]
*  Some deal, military action, the Israelis, us, both of us. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3442.32s)]
*  But it's quite another to basically argue it's none of our business. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3448.32s)]
*  And that's where the isolationists are. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3454.32s)]
*  It's none of our business. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3456.32s)]
*  It can be managed. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3458.32s)]
*  Israel has a bomb, we have a bomb. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3461.32s)]
*  Why should the Islamist terrorists who keep threatening us get an atomic bomb? [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3463.32s)]
*  So again, it's one thing to debate whether there should be military action or not. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3468.32s)]
*  And if there's a deal and I look at the deal and I personally don't like it, I will condemn it. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3474.32s)]
*  But that's quite different from the isolationists. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3479.32s)]
*  From the Katarosins and his ilk. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3483.32s)]
*  They're saying, forget about it. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3489.32s)]
*  Don't worry about it. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3493.32s)]
*  That's what they're saying. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3495.32s)]
*  And of course, and of course, that would be suicide. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3500.32s)]
*  So you either stand with the president or you stand with them because he's not one of them. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3507.32s)]
*  And if they have a deal and it's a bomb deal, of course I'm going to criticize it. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3515.32s)]
*  But again, that's a debate between and among those of us who are sincere about trying to protect America from the Islamist Nazi regime. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3519.32s)]
*  That's not a debate with the isolationists who believe it's a matter of ideological fact that we should not be involved overseas. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3528.32s)]
*  Unless of course they're supporting Putin and Qatar and those people. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3538.32s)]
*  Then of course we should be. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3542.32s)]
*  But you get my point. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3544.32s)]
*  Let me try it again. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3546.32s)]
*  It's one thing if there's a deal or military action by us or Israel or both of us where people want a deal, criticize the military action or people who think there should be military action criticize the deal. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3548.32s)]
*  That's one thing. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3566.32s)]
*  But it's quite another thing to be an isolationist. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3569.32s)]
*  Which is what I'm dealing with. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3573.32s)]
*  Which is what I'm exposing. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3575.32s)]
*  I'm going to be talking about each and every one of them and I'm not done. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3577.32s)]
*  It's only round three or four. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3581.32s)]
*  There's going to be many rounds as far as I'm concerned. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3583.32s)]
*  That's quite different than the Charles Koch heads, the Noam Chomskis, the Rand Pauls. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3588.32s)]
*  These are extremists. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3597.32s)]
*  These are ideologues. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3599.32s)]
*  Farm policy is not about ideology. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3602.32s)]
*  It's about principles and prudence. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3605.32s)]
*  Using prudence, judgment, wisdom, facts, experience to apply them to your principles. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3608.32s)]
*  Like one principle is, it's the job of the Commander in Chief to protect America. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3615.32s)]
*  Okay. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3620.32s)]
*  How do you do that? [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3621.32s)]
*  Ignore the Iranians? [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3622.32s)]
*  So what? [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3623.32s)]
*  Now if you really want to know what the isolationists think, the embeds at our White House and at the Department of Defense and the State Department, read Axios. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3626.32s)]
*  Because they're leaking all over the place. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3637.32s)]
*  Doing enormous damage to our national security. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3640.32s)]
*  Undermining the President's negotiation position. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3644.32s)]
*  They're providing information about missiles and all kinds of things that you would think is classified. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3648.32s)]
*  But there it is. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3654.32s)]
*  They should be investigated. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3657.32s)]
*  They should be investigated. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3660.32s)]
*  And for their leaks, they should be charged. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3661.32s)]
*  In my humble opinion. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3664.32s)]
*  That's what we would have done in the Reagan administration. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3665.32s)]
*  And that's what we ought to do now. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3667.32s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3672.32s)]
*  They're the ones who have a desperate 11th hour full on pressure campaign using their media friends on the left, many of them. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3674.32s)]
*  Some of their goofball media friends on the hard right. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3686.32s)]
*  Who are not Constitutional conservatives. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3690.32s)]
*  They are as I described them. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3692.32s)]
*  And themselves. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3695.32s)]
*  And their own platforms. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3696.32s)]
*  I'm trying to convince you of something that is utterly insane. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3699.32s)]
*  A forever war. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3705.32s)]
*  It wouldn't be a forever war. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3706.32s)]
*  Tens of thousands of troops will die. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3709.32s)]
*  We don't have tens of thousands of troops there. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3711.32s)]
*  We're not sending them there like we did with Iraq. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3713.32s)]
*  The Israelis are dragging us into this. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3717.32s)]
*  They're not dragging us into anything. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3720.32s)]
*  And furthermore, President of the United States has said. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3723.32s)]
*  They're not and they won't. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3728.32s)]
*  That's right. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3730.32s)]
*  Those hypersonic missiles they want. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3731.32s)]
*  But in any event. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3734.32s)]
*  Those intercontinental ballistic missiles. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3736.32s)]
*  You know if they shot one. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3738.32s)]
*  Those things can reach us. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3741.32s)]
*  So why are they hell bent on building them? [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3743.32s)]
*  For domestic energy? [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3746.32s)]
*  And it's about time the isolationists lay out their national security program. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3749.32s)]
*  What is it? [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3755.32s)]
*  How would you deal with Iran? [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3756.32s)]
*  Not at all. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3758.32s)]
*  What would you do? [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3759.32s)]
*  You see their problem is this. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3761.32s)]
*  They've denied the fact that Iran is trying to create nuclear weapons. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3762.32s)]
*  So they're liars. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3767.32s)]
*  They've denied the fact. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3769.32s)]
*  They're liars. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3770.32s)]
*  They've denied the fact that Iran is a grave threat to us. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3773.32s)]
*  So they deny the fact that they're seeking nukes. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3777.32s)]
*  And they deny the fact that Iran is a great threat. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3781.32s)]
*  So what exactly is their program? [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3783.32s)]
*  How are they going to put it together? [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3785.32s)]
*  They can't have a program. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3786.32s)]
*  Because if you deny the enemy is the enemy. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3788.32s)]
*  What program do you need? [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3790.32s)]
*  You don't need anything. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3791.32s)]
*  Is that how you feel folks? [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3792.32s)]
*  Is that what you believe? [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3793.32s)]
*  This is why they sound like Bernie Sanders. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3800.32s)]
*  These are Bernie Sanders so-called Republicans. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3802.32s)]
*  That's what they are. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3805.32s)]
*  Now they attack our past foreign policy. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3811.32s)]
*  But like anything else there's issues you certainly can attack in our past foreign policy. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3815.32s)]
*  But there's issues you can also celebrate. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3819.32s)]
*  The Soviet Union was a grave threat to the free world and the United States. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3826.32s)]
*  At the end of World War II. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3832.32s)]
*  Where is the Soviet Union today? [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3835.32s)]
*  Where is it? [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3837.32s)]
*  Ronald Reagan destroyed them without firing a shot. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3840.32s)]
*  But we had to get involved in other wars like Afghanistan. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3844.32s)]
*  Like Angola. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3848.32s)]
*  Like Nicaragua. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3850.32s)]
*  Like the Middle East. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3852.32s)]
*  In order to push back against the Soviet Union. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3854.32s)]
*  But they imploded. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3859.32s)]
*  Soon after he left office. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3862.32s)]
*  Was he a war hawk? [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3866.32s)]
*  Today Ronald Reagan would be dismissed as a kook. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3869.32s)]
*  As a neocon. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3873.32s)]
*  As a warmonger. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3875.32s)]
*  And he did more for peace than any president. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3878.32s)]
*  Not just in our lifetime probably. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3881.32s)]
*  Since the end of World War II. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3884.32s)]
*  He destroyed the Soviet Union. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3887.32s)]
*  With the help of real neocons. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3891.32s)]
*  Real neocons. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3894.32s)]
*  Gene Kirkpatrick. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3896.32s)]
*  Among others. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3899.32s)]
*  I'm not a neocon. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3901.32s)]
*  I'm straight up conservative. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3903.32s)]
*  But we used neocons, we used conservatives, we used whatever we could. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3905.32s)]
*  We made the case, we were united and we destroyed the Soviet Union. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3909.32s)]
*  Tell me. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3912.32s)]
*  Who of the isolationists prevented from harming us? [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3914.32s)]
*  Name one country. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3916.32s)]
*  One. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3917.32s)]
*  Because they're not in the business of national security. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3918.32s)]
*  They're not in the business of defending the country. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3921.32s)]
*  They're not in the business of undermining those who want to defend the country and undermine the country. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3924.32s)]
*  And they cannot distinguish between people who make good judgments and prudential judgments and everybody else. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3928.32s)]
*  They just lob these broadsides. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3934.32s)]
*  Then they throw in their fortune cookie statements. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3937.32s)]
*  Then they call names and that's it. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3941.32s)]
*  I want to see the plan. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3944.32s)]
*  For what the isolationists would do with Iran. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3947.32s)]
*  And don't tell me it would be economic. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3950.32s)]
*  Because if you tell me it's economic, then you're confessing that they're a threat and they're a danger. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3952.32s)]
*  So what is it? [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3960.32s)]
*  It's nothing. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3961.32s)]
*  There is no plan. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3962.32s)]
*  If Iran's not a threat and a danger. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3964.32s)]
*  If it doesn't matter if they get a nuclear weapon. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3966.32s)]
*  If it can be managed and everything's our fault or the Jews' fault in Israel. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3968.32s)]
*  Then you don't have a plan. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3973.32s)]
*  You have a big mouth. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=3975.32s)]

*  They sent them against the rioters who were attacking federal ICE officials who had federal [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4290.32s)]
*  warrants. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4298.32s)]
*  It is amazing to me. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4299.32s)]
*  These people go on and on and on about January 6, January 6, January 6. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4300.32s)]
*  You attack an ICE official. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4304.32s)]
*  It's OK. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4306.32s)]
*  You try to destroy a federal courthouse. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4307.32s)]
*  It's OK. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4310.32s)]
*  These people, their party has physical alterations with federal officials. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4311.32s)]
*  Barges into a conference. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4319.32s)]
*  I mean, folks, seriously. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4320.32s)]
*  Go ahead. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4324.32s)]
*  This administration is purposely escalating the situation with this step and [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4326.32s)]
*  escalating the situation apparently means. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4331.32s)]
*  Sending in lawful officers to put down the riots. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4337.32s)]
*  So that's now escalating. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4344.32s)]
*  You understand? [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4345.32s)]
*  Go ahead. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4346.32s)]
*  This is the process. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4347.32s)]
*  Let's call it for what it is. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4348.32s)]
*  It's political theater. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4350.32s)]
*  Hexeth, are the Marines in Los Angeles? [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4352.32s)]
*  This guy's an IQ of a cumquat. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4358.32s)]
*  But even cumquats deserve representation, I guess, in Congress. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4363.32s)]
*  Go ahead. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4366.32s)]
*  Order to protect property by any means necessary. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4367.32s)]
*  Oh, I love that one. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4371.32s)]
*  I love that one. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4373.32s)]
*  This is the Marxist stuff. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4374.32s)]
*  You're literally going to use law enforcement to protect property? [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4376.32s)]
*  Property is not human beings. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4380.32s)]
*  To protect property? [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4382.32s)]
*  You're going to protect property? [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4385.32s)]
*  Is that what you're going to do in law enforcement? [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4387.32s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4389.32s)]
*  We are. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4390.32s)]
*  These are people who do not know or comprehend our founding. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4393.32s)]
*  They talk about property and property rights. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4399.32s)]
*  It's just amazing. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4402.32s)]
*  The shortest book I've ever written. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4404.32s)]
*  It's probably the most important. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4406.32s)]
*  I have a whole section here from James Madison on property. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4407.32s)]
*  Let's talk about property, should we? [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4412.32s)]
*  Because these people make it sound like it's no big deal. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4415.32s)]
*  So they destroy property. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4417.32s)]
*  What the hell's the problem with destroying property? [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4419.32s)]
*  This is on page 110 of my new book on power. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4425.32s)]
*  On March 29, 1792, Madison penned an iconic essay on rights and power in the context of, ready? [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4429.32s)]
*  Property rights. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4439.32s)]
*  How do you like that, Mr. Producer? [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4440.32s)]
*  I choose to provide the essay in the full I write in the book. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4443.32s)]
*  But anyway, let me cut to his essay. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4446.32s)]
*  Here's what he writes. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4447.32s)]
*  Page 110 and beyond. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4449.32s)]
*  This term in particular application means that's property. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4452.32s)]
*  That dominion which one man claims and exercises over the external things of the world in exclusion of every other individual. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4455.32s)]
*  This is property. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4463.32s)]
*  In its larger and juster meaning, property embraces everything to which a man may attach a value and have a right. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4464.32s)]
*  And which leaves to everyone else the like advantage. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4472.32s)]
*  In the former sense, a man's land or merchandise or money is called his property. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4476.32s)]
*  In the latter sense, a man has a property in his opinions and the free communication of them. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4482.32s)]
*  You see, this guy and the Democrats want to take your property away. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4489.32s)]
*  Your physical property, your personal property, and the property he talks about. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4492.32s)]
*  Your ability to have free speech and opinions and think for yourself and free will. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4496.32s)]
*  He goes on. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4502.32s)]
*  Man has a property of peculiar value in his religious opinions and in the profession and practice. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4504.32s)]
*  Dictated by them. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4510.32s)]
*  Is a property value very dear to him? [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4512.32s)]
*  The safety and liberty of his person. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4515.32s)]
*  Here's an equal property in the free use of his faculties and free choice of the objects on which to employ them. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4517.32s)]
*  In a word, a man is said to have a right to his property. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4525.32s)]
*  He may be equally said to have a property in his rights. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4529.32s)]
*  Where an excess of power prevails, property of no sort is duly written. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4533.32s)]
*  Property of no sort is duly respected. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4538.32s)]
*  Now this is a key point in his essay that I have in the book on power. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4541.32s)]
*  Key point. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4546.32s)]
*  This is why I want us to think differently about what you hear from these people. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4548.32s)]
*  Because they talk like, you know, totalitarian thugs. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4552.32s)]
*  And that is their belief system. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4557.32s)]
*  We're going to protect property against, you know, lawless invaders? [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4559.32s)]
*  And Madison says absolutely, because you protect property in order to protect liberty and the rights of the individual. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4563.32s)]
*  In a word, to repeat, as a man is said to have a right in his property, he may be equally said to have a property in his rights. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4569.32s)]
*  Where an excess of power prevails, property of no sort is duly respected. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4578.32s)]
*  No man is safe in his opinions, his person, his faculties, or his possessions. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4583.32s)]
*  Where there is an excess of liberty, and in this case he's talking about, for instance, Marbreuil, [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4588.32s)]
*  the effect is the same, though from an opposite cause. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4593.32s)]
*  Government is instituted to protect property of every sort. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4597.32s)]
*  And think about what Trump has done, exactly what Madison is calling for. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4603.32s)]
*  As well, that which lies in the various rights of individuals, as that which the term particularly expresses. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4607.32s)]
*  This being the end of government. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4616.32s)]
*  He's saying this is the whole point of government. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4618.32s)]
*  That alone is a just government, which impartially secures to every man whatever is his own. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4620.32s)]
*  His opinion, his freedom, his physical property. That's what he's talking about. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4627.32s)]
*  According to this standard of merit, the praise of affording a just, securing to property, [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4633.32s)]
*  hold on, I got it, hold on here, [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4640.32s)]
*  should be sparingly bestowed on government, which, however, scrupulously guarding the possessions of individuals, [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4647.32s)]
*  does not protect them in the enjoyment and communication of their opinions, [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4655.32s)]
*  which they have an equal, and in the estimation of some, a more valuable property. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4659.32s)]
*  More sparingly, should this praise be allowed to a government, where a man's religious rights are violated by penalties, [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4664.32s)]
*  or fettered by tests, or taxed by a hierarchy. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4671.32s)]
*  Conscience is the most sacred of all property, other property depending in part on positive law. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4676.32s)]
*  The exercise of that being a natural and an alienable right. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4683.32s)]
*  Ready? This is Madison. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4689.32s)]
*  To guard a man's house as his castle, to pay public and enforce private debts with the most exact faith, [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4692.32s)]
*  can give no title to invade a man's conscience, which is more sacred than his castle, [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4699.32s)]
*  or to withhold from it that debt of protection, for which the public faith is pledged by the very nature and original conditions of the social pact, the civil society. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4706.32s)]
*  That is not a just government, nor is property secure under it, [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4716.32s)]
*  where the property which a man has in his personal safety and personal liberty, [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4722.32s)]
*  is violated by arbitrary seizures of one class of citizens, for the service of the rest. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4727.32s)]
*  My God, is Madison speaking to today? Is Madison answering this buffoon? [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4733.32s)]
*  He's saying, if you lose one of these properties, you're going to lose all of these properties. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4740.32s)]
*  And it isn't an accident that in these Marxist regimes, [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4746.32s)]
*  they steal the property. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4749.32s)]
*  They steal your physical property, your security, your labor, your investment. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4753.32s)]
*  And if they do that, they can steal your opinion, your thought, your freedom. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4762.32s)]
*  That's his point. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4768.32s)]
*  A magistrate issuing his warrants to a press gang would be in his proper functions in Turkey or in Dostan, [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4770.32s)]
*  under appellations, proverbially, of the most complete despotism. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4778.32s)]
*  In other words, he's talking about fake courts, you know, like many of that we have. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4783.32s)]
*  That is not a just government, nor is property secure under it, [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4789.32s)]
*  where arbitrary restrictions, exemptions, and monopolies denied to part of its citizens, [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4792.32s)]
*  that free use of their faculties and free choice of their occupations, [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4797.32s)]
*  which not only constitute their property in the general sense of the word, [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4802.32s)]
*  but are the means of acquiring property strictly so called. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4806.32s)]
*  What must be the spirit of legislation where a manufacturer of linen cloth [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4809.32s)]
*  is forbidden to bury his own child in a linen shroud, [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4813.32s)]
*  in order to favor his neighbor who manufactures woolen cloth? And he goes on. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4816.32s)]
*  A just security of property is not afforded by that government [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4822.32s)]
*  under which unequal taxes oppress one species of property and reward another species, [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4828.32s)]
*  where arbitrary taxes invade the domestic sanctuaries of the rich [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4833.32s)]
*  and excess taxes grind the faces of the poor, [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4837.32s)]
*  where the keenness and competitions of want are deemed an insufficient spirit of labor, [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4840.32s)]
*  and taxes are again applied by an unfeeling policy as another spirit, [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4846.32s)]
*  as another spirit in violation of that sacred property which heaven and decree man. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4849.32s)]
*  And he goes on, and you'll read this. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4854.32s)]
*  This is the argument against socialism and Marxism and fascism, [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4856.32s)]
*  for capitalism and freedom and our constitutionalism. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4860.32s)]
*  And this man, Salud Garbajo, [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4864.32s)]
*  are the Marines in Los Angeles order to protect property by any means necessary? [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4869.32s)]
*  Yes. From you and your mobsters. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4879.32s)]
*  Now let's ask this question. What is private property? [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4885.32s)]
*  Madison goes into property is much broader than real estate, [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4888.32s)]
*  but I want to deal with real estate, I want to deal with businesses, [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4892.32s)]
*  I want to deal with your investments, your property. What is property? [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4895.32s)]
*  I explain this in the book too. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4900.32s)]
*  And I explained it in Liberty and Tyranny. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4903.32s)]
*  Property is your physical and intellectual labor [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4905.32s)]
*  that you used to acquire enough funds to purchase a piece of property. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4910.32s)]
*  It is your life, it is your freedom that you applied to a certain effort. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4918.32s)]
*  And as a consequence of that effort, your motivation, your desire, [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4926.32s)]
*  you acquire a piece of property. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4930.32s)]
*  So somebody should be able to come along and burn it down, just like that. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4931.32s)]
*  Somebody should be able to come along and steal it, just like that. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4936.32s)]
*  To put graffiti on your walls, just like that. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4942.32s)]
*  That is you, that is your, that's the embodiment of your labor, [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4946.32s)]
*  of your freedom, intellectual and physical. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4952.32s)]
*  And this jackass says, well you're going to use the Marines to protect property? [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=4955.32s)]

*  A shadowy U.S. billionaire who is bankrolling radicals, including groups involved in this week's riots in LA, [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5156.32s)]
*  faces being hauled before a congressional committee according to a Republican lawmaker. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5163.32s)]
*  China-based Neville Roy Singham will be called to testify about his funding of myriad nonprofits, [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5167.32s)]
*  including radical anti-Israel and Marxist groups. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5174.32s)]
*  They include the Party for Liberation and Socialism, [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5178.32s)]
*  which has been heavily involved in protests against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, in LA this week. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5182.32s)]
*  Although there is no evidence they have been directly involved in any of the violence which has erupted there. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5189.32s)]
*  Well, it doesn't work that way. You got to go dig for it. It's not like they say, look at us, we're involved. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5194.32s)]
*  That's not the way it works. If he refuses to appear, he will be subpoenaed. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5199.32s)]
*  And if he ignores that, he will be referred to the Department of Justice for Prosecution, [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5205.32s)]
*  said Florida Representative Anna Polina Luna, in a post on X and all capital letters this week. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5210.32s)]
*  The congressional committee will be looking at Singham's links to the Communist Chinese Party, according to Luna. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5217.32s)]
*  In April, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary urged the Department of Justice to investigate the People's Forum in Code Pink, [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5224.32s)]
*  leftist activist groups affiliated with Singham and his wife Jody Evans. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5231.32s)]
*  Born in Chicago, the software entrepreneur and his activist wife now live in Shanghai. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5236.32s)]
*  So, you know, they're puppets of the communists. So they do the communist bidding and the communists protect them and their money. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5241.32s)]
*  We've talked about these people like two years ago, Rich. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5247.32s)]
*  Now live in Shanghai, but still funnel plenty of money back to the U.S. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5251.32s)]
*  Although they deny working for the Chinese government, they share offices with the Macau Group, [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5256.32s)]
*  a propaganda network which promotes the Chinese Communist Party abroad. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5261.32s)]
*  Evidence suggests that the People's Forum in Code Pink have been funded and influenced by Singham [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5265.32s)]
*  and the Communist Chinese government, both of which are foreign principals. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5271.32s)]
*  The evidence also suggests that the People's Forum in Code Pink have engaged in political activities [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5277.32s)]
*  that directly advance the Communist Chinese government's politics and policy interests, [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5283.32s)]
*  said Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5288.32s)]
*  Last year, the House Ways and Means Committee asked the IRS to revoke the tax-exempt status for the People's Forum, [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5291.32s)]
*  a Manhattan-based nonprofit financed by Singham, [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5297.32s)]
*  and that group helped organize anti-Israel demonstrations in this city a day after October 7, Hamas attacks. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5301.32s)]
*  Some of the group members were also behind the violent demonstrations at an encampment for Gaza at Columbia University. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5310.32s)]
*  The Singham network operates as a coordinated movement incubator, [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5317.32s)]
*  a term used by the People's Forum itself, said Alex Goldenberg, Senior Advisor to the National Contagion Research Institute. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5320.32s)]
*  Let me tell you, that is a great organization. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5328.32s)]
*  We've used them here with all the Qatar links, and hence, Qatarlson, [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5331.32s)]
*  a think tank that tracks disinformation on social media platforms. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5337.32s)]
*  It combines media, publishing, and organizing under one roof. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5342.32s)]
*  Most of the groups linked to Singham operate out of a Chinese New York office and cafe [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5345.32s)]
*  where People's Forum regularly offers courses with titles such as [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5351.32s)]
*  Radical Capitalism in Spanish for Social Justice. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5355.32s)]
*  Among the Singham-linked nonprofits are Breakthrough News and a radical book publishing company called 1804 Books. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5359.32s)]
*  These groups do not operate independently, Goldenberg told the Post. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5367.32s)]
*  They share leadership, funding, and a united ideological mission, [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5371.32s)]
*  closely aligned with the Party for Socialism and Liberation, [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5373.32s)]
*  a revolutionary Marxist organization expanding its presence on college campuses and in major cities. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5377.32s)]
*  How much have I talked about the fusion of the Marxists and the Islamists? [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5383.32s)]
*  It's there. I've exposed it. Others are now exposing it. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5386.32s)]
*  You know, when my book, American Marxism, came out, nobody would use the word Marxism. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5391.32s)]
*  My brothers and sisters on Fox kept using progressivism, socialism. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5396.32s)]
*  My brothers and sisters on TalkRadar, same thing. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5400.32s)]
*  Knock it off. These are Marxists. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5403.32s)]
*  The Party for Social and Liberation was recently tied to Elias Rodriguez, [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5408.32s)]
*  the suspect in the shooting deaths of two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington last month. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5413.32s)]
*  Hold on a second. These commercials keep popping up, these ads. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5419.32s)]
*  In 2017, Rodriguez attended a police brutality demonstration as part of the radical socialist group [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5424.32s)]
*  which immediately distanced itself from him in the wake of the shooting. Of course it did. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5430.32s)]
*  Now, this billionaire, Singham, 71, has not always been against the accumulation of capital. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5435.32s)]
*  He's the founder and former chair of ThoughtWorks, a tech consulting company [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5440.32s)]
*  which he sold to a private equity firm in 2017 for $785 million. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5445.32s)]
*  They say Roy Singham is incredibly charismatic. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5451.32s)]
*  Evans, his wife, she's 70, co-founded the anti-war group Copenque, sits on the board of the People's Forum. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5454.32s)]
*  So here you have these multi-billionaires and multi-millionaires who are communists. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5462.32s)]
*  Well, multi-millionaire, like Bernie Sanders, runs around and talks about oligarchs. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5470.32s)]
*  Hold on to billionaires and oligarchs. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5475.32s)]
*  And another extreme example, Evans and another activist with Copenque traveled to North Korea in 2015 [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5477.32s)]
*  as part of a delegation of Women Cross DMZ, a pro-North Korea nonprofit based in Hawaii. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5483.32s)]
*  How could it be a pro-North Korea nonprofit based in Hawaii? [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5489.32s)]
*  North Korea is a death camp, the whole country. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5497.32s)]
*  This is what we're up against, America. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5501.32s)]
*  This is why the Democrats don't like ICE, don't like borders, don't like the police, [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5503.32s)]
*  are now personally, physically brutalizing federal law enforcement, [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5510.32s)]
*  are attacking ICE the way they used to attack the cops, still attack the cops. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5515.32s)]
*  This is what we're up against. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5520.32s)]
*  They are communists, they are Islamists. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5522.32s)]
*  They are not going to be able to do anything about it. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5525.32s)]

*  The Israeli Air Force is hitting Iran as I speak. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5725.08s)]
*  There's two news outlets reporting on it. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5732.0s)]
*  So it's begun. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5736.379999999999s)]
*  Godspeed to those who are involved in the fight on our side. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5739.599999999999s)]
*  The United States military is involved. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5745.72s)]
*  Godspeed. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5747.56s)]
*  I'm sure they're on alert. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5748.56s)]
*  If not playing a supportive role. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5751.32s)]
*  But as best as I can tell right now, the Israeli Air Force is attacking Iran. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5755.32s)]
*  Was inevitable. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5761.48s)]
*  Was inevitable. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5763.64s)]
*  Let's see. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5766.88s)]
*  I'm just looking. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5772.32s)]

*  Just want you to keep something in mind. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5781.92s)]
*  This was inevitable. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5787.36s)]
*  Iran was not going to give up its nukes despite the fools in our country who were saying they [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5789.36s)]
*  would or who don't care. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5793.12s)]
*  Little Israel has to survive. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5796.5199999999995s)]
*  It has to defend its people. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5798.0s)]
*  Of course, it looks to its ally, the United States, they help them. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5800.48s)]
*  But this is about us too. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5804.839999999999s)]
*  It's about our security too. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5807.74s)]
*  This is an Islamic, Nazi, fundamentalist regime that tried to assassinate our president. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5810.839999999999s)]
*  This is a regime that backed the Houthis that were attacking our ships. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5818.639999999999s)]
*  Hezbollah that murdered our citizens and our marines. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5823.24s)]
*  They're not going away. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5828.16s)]
*  The Israelis have suffered enough in their 77, 78 year history as a state. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5832.16s)]
*  They suffered a lot on October 7th. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5842.4s)]
*  They know that the vast majority of the world is rooting against them. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5845.599999999999s)]
*  They know that there are elements in our own country that are rooting against them. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5849.84s)]
*  We know who they are. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5853.64s)]
*  These are people that are not going to allow another Holocaust to occur. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5858.08s)]
*  These are people that can defend themselves. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5864.04s)]
*  Communist China backs Iran. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5869.16s)]
*  Russia backs Iran. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5870.84s)]
*  Qatar backs Iran. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5873.88s)]
*  And there's little Israel. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5875.88s)]
*  Even though we provide them with support, we provide a lot of countries with support. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5880.92s)]
*  In Afghanistan, where they collapsed. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5887.6s)]
*  And same with other parts of the world, where they've collapsed. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5891.240000000001s)]
*  The Israelis will fight with their bare hands if they have to. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5895.96s)]
*  This Islamic regime was born in terror and revolution. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5900.160000000001s)]
*  It immediately took hundreds of our people hostage. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5904.6s)]
*  This regime slaughters its own people, rapes its own people. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5911.6s)]
*  But I guess we don't care about that. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5917.0s)]
*  Some of the countries no doubt cheering on Israel are Arabs. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5921.48s)]
*  Arab countries. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5930.04s)]
*  Trey Yankst confirms, Israel carried out strikes in Iran, explosions heard into the capital [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5933.52s)]
*  of Tehran, state of emergency declared across Israel as the country braces for an Iranian [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5940.36s)]
*  But I'm sure this is the first wave with the Israelis. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5946.32s)]
*  They know how to fight. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5951.36s)]
*  And of course they will have casualties. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5955.48s)]
*  But the people there have had enough. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5959.759999999999s)]
*  Siren after siren, day after day, missile after missile. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5963.28s)]
*  They don't bother anybody. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5966.44s)]
*  They want to be left alone. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5968.96s)]
*  So it's begun. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5972.48s)]
*  It was inevitable. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5974.88s)]
*  Despite all the talk, it was inevitable. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5976.12s)]
*  Donald Trump laid down the red line. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5979.04s)]
*  He said, no nukes. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5980.72s)]
*  The Iranians kept thumbing their noses and thumbing their noses. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5983.4800000000005s)]
*  And as you saw, there was a peace in Axios, which is a main outlet for leaks for the Israel [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5987.36s)]
*  haters, some of whom are embeds in the government, that they have accumulated thousands of sophisticated [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=5993.76s)]
*  missiles to rain down on the state of Israel. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6003.48s)]
*  And they were trying to accumulate more of them with the help of the communist Chinese. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6005.799999999999s)]
*  So it's not just nuclear weapons, although that would be bad enough. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6011.639999999999s)]
*  It's these sophisticated missiles that the Iron Dome can't stop. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6018.0s)]
*  It can't stop all of them. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6021.4s)]
*  It can stop only some of them. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6023.12s)]
*  And they can carry up to 2,000 pounds in explosives, Mr. Producer, 2,000 pounds. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6024.759999999999s)]
*  And the Iranian regime was bragging yesterday that they're making them carry 4,000 pounds. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6033.16s)]
*  You can blow up entire city blocks, entire city blocks. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6040.5199999999995s)]
*  So the best reports I have right now, Israel carried out strikes in Iran, explosions heard [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6047.84s)]
*  near the capital of Tehran, state of emergency in Israel, and a state of confusion in Iran. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6054.2s)]
*  And if you're a person of faith, I would say a prayer now is about the right thing. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6063.72s)]
*  I'm going to make a surmise. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6072.64s)]

*  That's all I've got. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6084.16s)]
*  I'm looking around. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6087.64s)]
*  This is live radio. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6088.64s)]
*  We're going to keep looking, Mr. Producer, until we see what we can find here. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6089.64s)]
*  ABC News. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6094.96s)]
*  Israel has launched what it's called a preemptive strike against Iran, declared a state of emergency [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6097.64s)]
*  according to Defense Minister Israel Katz. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6101.64s)]
*  Following the state of Israel's preemptive strike against Iran, a missile and drone attack [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6105.04s)]
*  against the state of Israel and its civilian population is expected in the immediate future, [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6108.56s)]
*  he said. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6112.88s)]
*  Air raid sirens sounded in Tel Aviv. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6113.88s)]
*  Following the announcement, the U.S. did not provide any assistance or have any involvement [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6116.52s)]
*  in the strike. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6121.120000000001s)]
*  A U.S. official told ABC News this is a developing story. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6122.120000000001s)]
*  So we shall see how this plays out. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6129.0s)]
*  CNN. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6132.040000000001s)]
*  Israel has launched what it called preemptive strikes against Iran, and a state of emergency [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6133.040000000001s)]
*  has been declared in Israel. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6138.080000000001s)]
*  Following the state of Israel's preemptive strike against Iran, so they're basically [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6140.68s)]
*  what the defense minister is saying, a missile and drone attack against the state of Israel [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6144.839999999999s)]
*  and its civilian population is expected in the immediate future, Katz said in his statement. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6149.4s)]
*  So they're expecting a response, which means they're prepared for it as best as they can [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6154.2s)]
*  be, which also means the Israeli Air Force and their missile systems will probably strike [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6160.32s)]
*  in waves. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6168.24s)]
*  Basically watch where the response comes from. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6170.8s)]
*  That's typical military strategy. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6175.68s)]
*  See where the response comes from. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6178.2s)]
*  See where the launchers are. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6179.66s)]
*  They know where most of them are, I'm guessing. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6181.4400000000005s)]
*  And then try and take them out. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6184.68s)]
*  Take out whatever air defenses they have left, whatever missile systems they have left, and [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6187.72s)]
*  then hit the nuke sites. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6194.72s)]
*  That's my guess. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6196.12s)]
*  Well no more. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6199.12s)]
*  Take a break. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6200.12s)]
*  No more after the bottom of the hour. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6201.12s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6204.12s)]
*  OK, open source intel. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6207.12s)]
*  The IDF has confirmed the launch of a major aerial operation targeting Iran's nuclear [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6221.4s)]
*  program. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6226.64s)]
*  As we pull these things together, I will continue to report to you as I get information. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6230.04s)]
*  Now I have some friends like Colonel Kemp and some others who are there. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6239.56s)]
*  I don't bother the embassy. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6244.28s)]
*  I don't bother my stepson. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6245.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't get into that. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6247.16s)]
*  But God bless them and everybody in the embassy and all their families. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6248.8s)]
*  And of course our families, you know, wide-open eyes and praying for everybody's health and [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6254.64s)]
*  security. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6262.360000000001s)]
*  But I do not take advantage of that connection. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6264.56s)]
*  But there are other people there who I do know, including a friend we have in Tel Aviv, [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6267.320000000001s)]
*  the embassy is in Jerusalem. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6276.200000000001s)]
*  Obviously you know that. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6278.08s)]
*  Keep an eye on all this. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6282.9s)]
*  I will be on Hannity tonight. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6285.339999999999s)]
*  I guess that's kind of coincidental. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6290.179999999999s)]
*  But there you have it. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6293.74s)]
*  So we're going to keep an eye on this. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6295.379999999999s)]
*  I don't see any other news reports at this point. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6296.74s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6300.0199999999995s)]
*  Here's something. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6302.0199999999995s)]
*  Stick with me, folks. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6305.099999999999s)]
*  I am looking. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6306.9s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6308.9s)]
*  Stick with me. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6311.54s)]
*  No, that's not what I'm looking for. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6313.54s)]
*  This is live radio. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6316.86s)]
*  That's the way it goes. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6317.86s)]
*  All right. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6320.179999999999s)]
*  We shall see. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6322.259999999999s)]
*  As I get more information, you'll get more information. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6323.259999999999s)]
*  The call should not. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6326.9s)]
*  Let's do this. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6328.86s)]
*  Let's go to Keith Las Vegas, Nevada, the great KXNT. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6330.5s)]
*  Keith, how are you? [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6333.259999999999s)]
*  Hi, Mark. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6335.299999999999s)]
*  Well, not really good now. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6336.299999999999s)]
*  Most of my kids are in the IVF. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6338.3s)]
*  My daughter is a lawyer. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6339.860000000001s)]
*  My son was a full combat. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6341.42s)]
*  He actually got injured in Lebanon, but he's going to be healing now. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6343.14s)]
*  He's going to probably go back into Gaza. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6346.54s)]
*  He's been in Gaza and Lebanon. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6348.3s)]
*  It's not easy. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6349.7s)]
*  And it's not easy. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6350.7s)]
*  People do not understand. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6352.34s)]
*  They do not understand that this is a war zone and that the Israelis are the target [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6354.06s)]
*  and it is constant. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6359.18s)]
*  And the reason they're lashing out against Iran is because they know Iran will use these [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6360.38s)]
*  weapons against them. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6364.3s)]
*  And they've got to stop them. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6366.46s)]
*  Every family is affected by this. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6367.54s)]
*  Go ahead. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6369.42s)]
*  The thing is what people need to understand. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6371.42s)]
*  And first of all, if I go further, I just want to tell you that we love you. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6373.38s)]
*  My family loves you. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6376.06s)]
*  And every time my kids come to the United States, I make them listen to you. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6377.06s)]
*  OK, thank you. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6380.06s)]
*  I can tell my daughter, you've got to be like this when you're a lawyer. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6381.78s)]
*  OK, and now she is. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6384.34s)]
*  But I will tell you that people need to understand that the regime of Iran, OK, are [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6385.9s)]
*  I mean, they believe in the body. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6392.1s)]
*  They believe the only way to have the Messiah, the Islamic Messiah to come is to the end [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6394.22s)]
*  of times. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6399.660000000001s)]
*  There is no negotiating with them. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6400.660000000001s)]
*  There is no negotiating. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6402.660000000001s)]
*  They will cheat and lie every single second. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6403.660000000001s)]
*  And today, when I heard that even the way we're negotiating, saying, well, we're not [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6407.5s)]
*  going to get involved. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6411.3s)]
*  We're not going to help Israel. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6412.3s)]
*  Really, we're not. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6413.660000000001s)]
*  Well, we don't know that's the case yet. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6414.660000000001s)]
*  We don't know that's the case. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6416.820000000001s)]
*  I'm hoping it's just a plan. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6418.740000000001s)]
*  Sometimes you do a head fake, you know, I'm holding an example. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6421.0599999999995s)]
*  The president, I'm just putting the pieces together. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6424.9s)]
*  He said as recently as what, a few hours ago, according to leaks to Axios from the isolationist [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6427.219999999999s)]
*  that Israel has been told no while we're negotiating, stay out of it. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6432.74s)]
*  And so that could have easily been a head fake by the president. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6436.459999999999s)]
*  Of course, Axios is attacking Israel and reporting that maybe they did this without the permission [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6440.139999999999s)]
*  of the United States and so forth and so on. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6447.54s)]
*  That's not my understanding of how it works between Israel and the United States and the [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6450.62s)]
*  isolationist, the embeds, they've been leaking Axios constantly that Trump and Netanyahu [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6454.22s)]
*  don't get together. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6459.14s)]
*  Excuse me, don't get along. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6460.14s)]
*  The president has told me that you get along beautifully, beautifully. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6461.9s)]
*  So we're reading a lot of disinformation and misinformation as well as this goes on. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6466.98s)]
*  And Ryan, God bless you and your family. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6472.98s)]
*  We pray for everybody. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6475.34s)]
*  So you take care of yourself. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6478.5s)]
*  As far as I'm concerned, Israel is now fighting on behalf of Israel, the United States, the [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6480.58s)]
*  free world. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6486.58s)]
*  It must succeed. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6488.58s)]
*  It must succeed. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6492.54s)]
*  Iran started this war in 1979. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6494.14s)]
*  Israel's confronting them, the threat of Iran on the cusp of nuclear weapons. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6498.38s)]
*  This is the real thing. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6502.14s)]
*  It's time for serious people. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6503.86s)]
*  And they're the ones on the front line. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6506.14s)]
*  They're the ones who are going to take the incoming. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6510.42s)]
*  Let's go to Joel Naples, Florida, the great WFSX. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnfsdih5uy8&t=6514.820000000001s)]
