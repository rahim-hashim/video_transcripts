Video Description: This week on the Mark Levin Show, Trump's decisive military actions prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, which no other president, including Clinton, Obama, or Biden, was willing or able to accomplish.  Without Trump's intervention, Iran would have become a nuclear power, potentially arming groups like the Houthis and enabling terrorist sleeper cells in the U.S. to acquire dirty bombs. Also, Trump’s actions on Iran have ensured peace for a period.  Iran has been militarily defeated by Israel and had its nuclear program destroyed by U.S. forces under Trump. Despite these setbacks, the enemy persists.  Trump is to be trusted. He wants to win for America and his record is stellar. Let’s see how it goes.  Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City, is a Marxist and an Islamist who supports Hamas slogans, the BDS movement, and holds anti-Semitic views, though he reportedly denies these claims. If voted Mayor of NYC he will cause New York City's decline, with good people leaving and radical Islamists arriving.  Mamdani’s positions, including his criticism of Israel and Marxist beliefs, are incompatible with American values and pose a threat to New York City, particularly given its large Jewish population.  The Senate parliamentarian is blocking Medicaid changes to waste, fraud, and abuse in the big, beautiful bill. House Republicans proposed tightening Medicaid eligibility with work requirements and restrictions on illegal aliens, but the Senate parliamentarian deemed these changes outside budget reconciliation, exposing the bill to a filibuster. The Senate’s decision not to challenge this ruling perpetuates Medicaid misuse. Additionally, the Senate opposes raising the $10,000 cap on home mortgage interest and property tax deductions, disproportionately affecting taxpayers in high-tax blue states. We need to maximize tax deductions for individuals no matter if they live in a blue or a red state.

# The Best Of Mark Levin - 6/28/25
**The Mark Levin Show:** [June 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE)
*  It's all quiet in the underground bunker. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=0.0s)]
*  Doors closed, locks bolted. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3.92s)]
*  But the Great One isn't just resting on his laurels. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=7.32s)]
*  He's making sure your weekend is even better by giving you his best. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=10.88s)]
*  This is the best of Mark Levin. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=15.76s)]
*  It's clear if Donald Trump was not president, Iran would have nuclear weapons. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=19.88s)]
*  It's that simple. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=26.2s)]
*  The Democrats, media, isolationists, the American lasters, like Green, like Bannon, like Katarelson, like Gates. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=28.64s)]
*  God, what a Star Wars bar scene that is. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=41.160000000000004s)]
*  That they have no strength, they have no pull, they have no numbers. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  They did everything they could to prevent him from ordering our military to take out those sites. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=49.24s)]
*  But he did it. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=55.32s)]
*  He had faith in our military, he had faith in his own principles, he understood. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=56.92s)]
*  There was no choice. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=61.160000000000004s)]
*  You understand there's no choice. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=62.6s)]
*  Massive majorities of you, the American people. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=65.08s)]
*  One of those sites taken out. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=69.2s)]
*  He did what no president before him was willing to do. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=71.32000000000001s)]
*  None. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=74.04s)]
*  Clinton, Obama, and of course Biden, who funded the enemy. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=74.52000000000001s)]
*  Clinton refused to bomb the nuclear site in North Korea in 1996. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=86.84s)]
*  So 2006, they came out with nuclear weapons and now they have a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=91.56s)]
*  Now they have 50 on the way to 90. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=95.92s)]
*  So President Trump hadn't done what he did despite these countervailing pressures. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=103.72s)]
*  Iran would be a nuclear Iran. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=110.08000000000001s)]
*  I have no doubt the Houthis would have a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=113.80000000000001s)]
*  They talk about the sleeper cells in America. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=118.0s)]
*  Well, those sleeper cells have been here for years. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=120.4s)]
*  They didn't just come here over the weekend. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=123.04s)]
*  I have no doubt they would have tried to get a dirty bomb. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=127.12s)]
*  Just think of all the possibilities, the ifs. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=130.24s)]
*  I hear people say, including some of my friends in broadcast, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=134.8s)]
*  now let's see what the sleeper cells do. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=140.52s)]
*  Now let's see what they do to our military sites. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=142.32s)]
*  Now let's see. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=144.84s)]
*  They act like we don't have experience with this country. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=145.84s)]
*  They act like they're just as stupid as Marjorie Taylor Greene, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=148.6s)]
*  who said Iran has never killed an American. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=152.08s)]
*  They've been killing and maiming and spreading terrorism. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=157.52s)]
*  They don't need a quote unquote reaction to what took place in order to keep doing it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=161.68s)]
*  And they're going to keep doing it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=165.64s)]
*  Look, whether it's Iran, whether it's Hamas, whether it's Hezbollah, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=167.12s)]
*  the Muslim Brotherhood, Al-Qaeda, ISIS, Islamic Jihad, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=173.68s)]
*  and the list goes on and on and on, they're not going to stop. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=178.44s)]
*  They're not going to stop. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=183.16000000000003s)]
*  Because they believe their faith, as perverse as their approach to their faith is, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=186.8s)]
*  is to kill us. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=190.88000000000002s)]
*  That that's what God's mandate is. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=194.24s)]
*  So they kill Muslims who don't agree with them. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=198.08s)]
*  They kill Jews and Christians. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=201.16000000000003s)]
*  They don't care. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=203.36s)]
*  Atheists, gay people, they particularly hate. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=204.0s)]
*  They hate us, America. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=207.44s)]
*  And they're not going to stop. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=212.68s)]
*  Even if Iran were wiped out to face the earth, they're not going to stop. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  I'm sorry to pour reality on us, but they're not. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=223.8s)]
*  Let me tell you what's not going to happen to prove my point. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=228.08s)]
*  We have terrorist working groups, local, state, federal law enforcement. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=235.12s)]
*  They're not going away. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=239.84s)]
*  TSA at the airports, it's not going away. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=241.88000000000002s)]
*  Terrorist units within virtually every metropolitan police department, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  certainly every federal law enforcement entity, they're not going away. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=252.36s)]
*  The fence around the White House isn't going away. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=257.08s)]
*  The bulletproof glass when the president speaks, that's not going away. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=263.44s)]
*  It's not going away. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=269.56s)]
*  Of course we have homegrown nut jobs. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=270.59999999999997s)]
*  But we also have terrorists. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=272.4s)]
*  They're not going away. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=277.84s)]
*  It's very, very important to understand this. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=278.76s)]
*  You can only do what you can do. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=282.68s)]
*  Iran is still a horrendous danger. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=285.28s)]
*  They're plotting, the communist Chinese are plotting, North Korea is plotting, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=293.67999999999995s)]
*  and so many others. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=297.23999999999995s)]
*  They're not going to back down. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=299.76s)]
*  North Korea is going to build more nukes. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=301.59999999999997s)]
*  China is going to continue to build up its military as it eyeballs Taiwan, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=304.59999999999997s)]
*  islands off of Japan, Philippines, and beyond. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=309.28s)]
*  I mean, what the hell, they're on both sides of the Panama Canal. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=314.2s)]
*  That's not a mistake. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=316.71999999999997s)]
*  They're militarizing the Arctic Circle. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=318.64s)]
*  That's not a mistake. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=320.47999999999996s)]
*  Their base is in the middle of Pacific, including in Saipan, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=322.32s)]
*  where my great uncle fought. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=326.24s)]
*  That's not a mistake. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=327.84s)]
*  Their base is based on the west coast of Africa, facing our coast. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=329.28s)]
*  That's not a mistake. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=332.96s)]
*  These are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous entities. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=336.0s)]
*  So we can go around with the modern day peaceniks, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=338.64s)]
*  even though some of them are fat and slovenly. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=340.88s)]
*  Even though some of them pretend to be ultra patriotic, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=343.52s)]
*  even though they pretend to support our troops when they undermine our troops [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=347.84s)]
*  in a time of a battle like this. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=350.88s)]
*  They have the same voice, the same mindset, and we know this [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=354.96s)]
*  because of Tlaib and Omar and Bernie Sanders, with whom they've united. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=358.64s)]
*  With whom they've united. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=367.76s)]
*  And so this is a forever fight within the United States. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=369.2s)]
*  If we want to be safe and free, if you want your children and grandchildren [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=374.0s)]
*  to be the like, this enemy's not going away. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=378.08s)]
*  One day it's Iran, it's going to be another country and so forth and so on. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=383.44s)]
*  What do you want to do, warmonger? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=387.28000000000003s)]
*  What do you mean, what do I want to do? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=388.8s)]
*  I don't want to go to war with every country. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=390.88s)]
*  And we're not. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=394.8s)]
*  It's impossible. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=396.08000000000004s)]
*  It would also be stupid. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=396.96s)]
*  I told you foreign policy is based on prudence, not ideology. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=400.08s)]
*  Prudence, not ideology. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=404.71999999999997s)]
*  Each case has to be taken with its facts. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=406.64s)]
*  Intelligence, history, who's in charge. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=410.64s)]
*  There's a whole long list of things that need to be taken into consideration. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=413.76s)]
*  Far above my pay grade, and that's why we have the great military that we do. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=418.71999999999997s)]
*  They help us figure these things out. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=423.84s)]
*  That said, all these protections we have in place in our homeland, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=424.96s)]
*  whatever this ceasefire is or whatever deal is made, they're not going to go away. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=434.88s)]
*  Are they? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=443.12s)]
*  Well, why not? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=444.15999999999997s)]
*  Because the enemy is the enemy. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=446.71999999999997s)]
*  They're not going away. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=449.12s)]
*  The Islamist Nazi terrorists are not going away. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=450.08s)]
*  If they can take down, they can take down another building with a thousand Americans in it, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=457.44s)]
*  they're going to do it. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=463.68s)]
*  If they can assassinate our president, they're going to do it, or at least try. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=467.84s)]
*  They can slaughter people in a mall or plant bombs [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=473.52s)]
*  or shoot people in the back when they're leaving an event. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=477.2s)]
*  They're going to do it. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=480.56s)]
*  They're going to do it. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=482.15999999999997s)]
*  And it's not because of what happened in Iran. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=482.71999999999997s)]
*  Everything I just mentioned to you happened before what took place over this weekend. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=486.32s)]
*  The sleeper cells have been here. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=490.71999999999997s)]
*  The assassination attempt on our president took place. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=492.47999999999996s)]
*  These terrorist front groups are in our country. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=499.44s)]
*  Not because the Israelis destroyed the Iranian military, not because our military [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=501.36s)]
*  destroyed their nuclear sites. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=506.96000000000004s)]
*  They're here. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=510.32s)]
*  And there's going to be more of them. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=513.28s)]
*  They have children and grandchildren. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=515.92s)]
*  We have federal judges who keep releasing them. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=517.92s)]
*  They're here. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=520.8000000000001s)]
*  They're roaming the streets. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=521.6s)]
*  They're destroying the country. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=522.72s)]
*  They're destroying our territory. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=524.72s)]
*  They're destroying our security. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=525.9200000000001s)]
*  They're destroying our security. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=528.8000000000001s)]
*  They're roaming the streets. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=530.24s)]
*  They're destroying our schools. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=533.32s)]
*  They're creating a whole new mindset in this country, which is embraced by these fake MAGA [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=535.64s)]
*  guys, which is embraced by the Democrat Party, which is embraced by much of the media. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=542.12s)]
*  This is why we must continue to speak out. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=550.72s)]
*  We must be resolute. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=554.88s)]
*  Some of the slogans in the bumper sticker statements about warmongers and neocons and [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=558.36s)]
*  who's more principled than the next, none of that matters. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=562.5600000000001s)]
*  None of it. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=566.64s)]
*  This is a fake cabal. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=568.1800000000001s)]
*  This is a fake media and a very, very dangerous Democrat Party. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=572.1800000000001s)]
*  Very dangerous. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=580.5600000000001s)]
*  You have the Arab countries in the Middle East who have united against Iran tonight [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=584.98s)]
*  because they were never supporters of Iran except for Qatar, who Qatarilson has praised. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=589.1800000000001s)]
*  But even Qatar got its dander up, if you will. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=595.62s)]
*  This thing about Iran and the shooting of the missiles, I mean, the president all but [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=604.1s)]
*  said the whole thing was play acting. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=608.86s)]
*  They hid nothing. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=612.7s)]
*  They were shot out of the sky. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=614.66s)]
*  The Qataris got a heads up. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=615.9399999999999s)]
*  The United States got a heads up. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=617.66s)]
*  And apparently the Israelis got a heads up. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=619.02s)]
*  So they get the same face. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=621.9399999999999s)]
*  This is a regime, a regime that is likely now to remain in place unless the Iranian [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=623.4599999999999s)]
*  people rise up, which is less likely, I think, at this point. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=633.74s)]
*  Less likely at this point. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=639.22s)]
*  Other people who will try and twist it and attack it. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=644.3s)]
*  Anytime you want to know what I say, you listen. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=648.62s)]
*  If you can't listen live, you go to our website, marklevinshow.com. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=651.9399999999999s)]
*  We keep four years worth of archives there. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=655.78s)]
*  Four years. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=658.26s)]
*  Mark Levine. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=659.26s)]
*  Making your weekend even better. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=660.26s)]
*  This is the best of Mark Levine. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=672.18s)]
*  We spent a lot of time on this last night, but I think considering some of the things [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=675.02s)]
*  that happened really very early in the morning here or in the course of the night and then [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=679.38s)]
*  day in Israel, it's worth reiterating and commenting on. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=686.42s)]
*  You'll notice at no time do I trash the president of the United States. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=692.54s)]
*  I say he's committing this. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=695.4599999999999s)]
*  He's committing that. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=697.42s)]
*  No. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=699.2199999999999s)]
*  The enemy whose military has been defeated by the Israelis, this was posted last evening. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=700.54s)]
*  His nuclear program has been destroyed by our president of the military survives, at [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=705.62s)]
*  least for now. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=709.1s)]
*  We shall see all things unfold. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=710.86s)]
*  I've been and remain highly skeptical of deals made with terrorists of half a century record [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=713.46s)]
*  of killing Americans, Israelis, and anyone else in their way, and refuse to voluntarily [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=718.7s)]
*  abandon their nuclear weapons, lying and deceiving every step of the way. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=723.26s)]
*  Perhaps this is another POTUS strategy. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=728.5s)]
*  Perhaps POTUS believes this will smoke them out, and if they do not adhere to ceasefire [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=731.1s)]
*  terms or some agreement, then all bets are off. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=735.46s)]
*  But they've already been smoked out. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=739.54s)]
*  And will whatever is agreed to include their proxies? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=742.04s)]
*  Will Russia stop supplying ground-to-air missile defense systems? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=745.5s)]
*  Will China stop selling the regime fuel for their ballistic missiles? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=749.14s)]
*  Will they stop building ballistic missiles? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=752.78s)]
*  My prediction, based on all of this and more, is that the terrorist regime's belief system [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=756.14s)]
*  and mindset will not be changed at all. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=760.42s)]
*  Just its tactics, maybe. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=763.1s)]
*  We shall see how this plays out. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=764.98s)]
*  Now, that seems to be a very rational comment, and we want the administration to succeed. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=767.6999999999999s)]
*  We want America to succeed, and it seems to me these are crucial issues that still need [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=775.38s)]
*  to be addressed, and may well be addressed. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=778.9s)]
*  And then I added, because I hit the send, as I'm wont to do while I'm on the air here, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=782.58s)]
*  but I meant to add and I added quickly thereafter, to be absolutely clear as I didn't finish [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=787.98s)]
*  my post, that President Trump is to be trusted. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=793.12s)]
*  He wants to win for America, and his record is stellar. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=796.48s)]
*  I also trust that the issues I mentioned here will be part of the process. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=799.34s)]
*  But Prime Minister Netanyahu has signed on. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=804.4200000000001s)]
*  Let's see how it goes. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=806.82s)]
*  I'm rooting for them. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=808.1s)]
*  Now, does that seem like a warmonger talk? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=810.78s)]
*  Does that seem anything like it? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=815.1800000000001s)]
*  I mean, if you're sitting down and you're either working a ceasefire or you get a ceasefire [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=816.66s)]
*  and then you're trying to figure out what to do next, don't you want to know what the [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=822.62s)]
*  Russians are going to do, the Chinese are going to do, the nature of the ballistic missiles [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=825.08s)]
*  and all these other things? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=828.82s)]
*  Of course. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=832.62s)]
*  Of course. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=835.22s)]
*  Of course they do. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=837.7s)]
*  So what happened? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=839.7s)]
*  Right out of the box, the Iranians are firing ballistic missiles after midnight, our time [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=842.7800000000001s)]
*  tonight. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=847.94s)]
*  But they only fired two, maybe it was one, maybe it was four. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=848.94s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=855.7s)]
*  Israelis wanted to respond. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=858.9000000000001s)]
*  The President asked them not to. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=860.38s)]
*  Also, the head of their atomic weapons program, he declared that this regime intends to reconstruct [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=866.18s)]
*  its nuclear program. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=879.3s)]
*  He said that. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=881.7399999999999s)]
*  They intend to reconstruct it. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=882.7399999999999s)]
*  President put out a true social and said, no, they're not going to be able to do that. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=886.5s)]
*  In other words, the mindset of the Islamonazi regime in Iran has not changed. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=892.6s)]
*  And it's not going to change. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=897.6s)]
*  To do that from their perspective, they have to abandon their so-called religious beliefs. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=900.24s)]
*  They're not going to do that. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=908.12s)]
*  They kill and maim, they send out suicide bombers to advance it. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=910.0600000000001s)]
*  Why do you think the sleeper cells in the United States that have been here? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=916.72s)]
*  Why do you think they've killed thousands of Americans directly and indirectly over [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=920.96s)]
*  the course of 47 years? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=924.12s)]
*  Why do you think they wanted to build a nuclear program in the first place? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=926.5600000000001s)]
*  See, they prove the point. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=929.44s)]
*  They believe they're going to heaven based on how many people they convert, but the people [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=937.12s)]
*  they don't convert, they slaughter. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=941.8000000000001s)]
*  They still didn't unilaterally surrender. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=947.0s)]
*  We didn't ask them to unilaterally surrender. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=949.08s)]
*  We have a ceasefire. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=952.1600000000001s)]
*  We'll see how that goes. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=953.1600000000001s)]
*  And it's much easier for democracy to place pressure on a democracy, the United States [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=957.64s)]
*  place pressure on Israel than it is for a regime from whom pressure doesn't seem to [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=962.08s)]
*  matter. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=968.5200000000001s)]
*  There was a lot of pressure placed on this regime to the lead up of Israel's attack on [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=969.5200000000001s)]
*  them. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=974.0s)]
*  Even to the point where Israel had blown out so much of their military, not the ballistic [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=977.0s)]
*  missiles, they were working on them, but they had a massive stockpile, but their army, their [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=984.24s)]
*  Navy, their Air Force, nonexistent for most intensive purposes. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=988.2800000000001s)]
*  Even with threats of our sending our B-2 bombers and taking out their, they never surrendered. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=993.6800000000001s)]
*  In fact, they never gave an inch. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1000.0400000000001s)]
*  Period. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1003.36s)]
*  They would not agree to the core issue of spinning centrifuges. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1005.2s)]
*  They were defiant. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1010.76s)]
*  They put out statements. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1011.76s)]

*  Their nuclear weapons are gone, so they can't use them against us. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1052.22s)]

*  Of course it is. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1133.44s)]
*  Was they taking out of their nuclear sites? [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1136.76s)]

*  Their terrorist ideology? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1142.92s)]

*  Now, leadership means everything. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1241.4s)]

*  There's nothing to blame the Israelis for. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1291.3200000000002s)]
*  They're trying to survive. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1295.24s)]

*  I just heard one commentator put it. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1318.06s)]
*  Israel was responding to the Islamic regime that had just fired ballistic missiles into [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1321.06s)]

*  One ballistic missile, what's the big deal? [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1328.4199999999998s)]
*  I ask you this. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1330.3s)]
*  If Mexico fired one ballistic missile into America after having fired hundreds of them [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1332.22s)]

*  There's no question about it. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1349.94s)]

*  in another country that is democratically elected and with which we share our Judeo-Christian [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1357.88s)]

*  Even more, I believe. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1385.8s)]
*  That's why we consider Donald Trump a great leader. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1386.8s)]

*  incompatible. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1542.54s)]
*  Now, what do I mean by that? [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1543.54s)]
*  Is that because I hate Muslims? [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1547.98s)]
*  Has nothing to do with that. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1549.5s)]
*  Nothing whatsoever. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1553.26s)]
*  But you've got to be able to speak the truth. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1556.26s)]
*  You know, you've got to be able to speak the truth, whether it's Carlson or Bannon or the [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1557.7s)]
*  rest of them, and you've got to be able to speak the truth about this. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1561.98s)]
*  This is life and death stuff. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1565.8200000000002s)]
*  As an example, the regime that runs Iran is not going to stop. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1568.14s)]
*  There's only so much a president can do in his term. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1575.8200000000002s)]
*  We took out their nukes. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1578.8600000000001s)]
*  The prime minister defeated them militarily. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1580.0200000000002s)]
*  But they're not going to stop. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1588.7800000000002s)]
*  Why? [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1589.7800000000002s)]
*  Because they are zealots. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1590.7800000000002s)]
*  They are fanatics. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1593.18s)]
*  They're throwbacks to the seventh century. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1594.26s)]
*  Let me explain. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1600.18s)]
*  First let's talk about ourselves. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1602.86s)]
*  I think this is important. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1604.02s)]
*  This is a little cerebral and that's important. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1605.1s)]
*  I like to get back to cerebral. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1606.74s)]
*  We're going to get out of the, out of this, out of the yes-or-no. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1608.82s)]
*  We're going to talk, Mark talk. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1611.42s)]
*  You and I, we believe God is the sovereign. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1617.18s)]
*  I don't care if you're an atheist or an agnostic. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1619.82s)]
*  You don't have to believe that. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1621.76s)]
*  But you benefit from it. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1623.68s)]
*  And I'll explain that in a minute too. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1625.04s)]
*  The people in this country benefit from the Judeo-Christian belief system, whether they [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1628.64s)]
*  are Jewish or Christian or not. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1633.48s)]
*  You don't have to be a Jew. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1638.68s)]
*  You don't have to be a Christian. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1639.88s)]
*  But you benefit from the Judeo-Christian value belief principle system. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1641.64s)]
*  You also benefit from the enlightenment. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1653.56s)]
*  From the enlightenment. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1658.36s)]
*  Now this is all in my new book, by the way, On Power. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1659.36s)]
*  In one section of it. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1664.1s)]
*  It's not the whole thing. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1665.1s)]
*  But I want you to hear me out because this is, this affects what's going on right now [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1667.62s)]
*  in New York and the whole country and Iran and all the rest of it. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1670.62s)]
*  We believe God is the sovereign. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1677.3799999999999s)]
*  Read your Declaration of Independence. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1679.28s)]
*  You don't even have to open the Bible. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1680.98s)]
*  Read your Declaration of Independence. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1682.68s)]
*  Natural law, natural rights, unalienable rights, universal truth. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1686.16s)]
*  Where does all that come from? [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1692.28s)]
*  Doesn't come from man. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1694.1200000000001s)]
*  Your founders in 1776 issued a Declaration of Independence, in essence a declaration [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1698.6000000000001s)]
*  of war against the most powerful military on the face of the earth, the British. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1705.38s)]
*  And they wanted to make it clear to the whole world why, why they are going to fight the [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1709.84s)]
*  most powerful military on the face of the earth. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1716.64s)]
*  Was almost a forever war, you know, went on for seven years, eight years. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1721.26s)]
*  But that aside. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1725.16s)]
*  And what did they cite, among other things? [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1729.32s)]
*  The core of it was, we have unalienable rights. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1732.16s)]
*  We have the right to be free. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1736.8799999999999s)]
*  We have the right to representative government. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1738.6399999999999s)]
*  There's natural law, natural. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1741.7199999999998s)]
*  Natural rights, unalienable rights that no man, no government can give or take. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1745.9199999999998s)]
*  The sovereign does. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1752.56s)]
*  Okay with me right now? [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1755.48s)]
*  Now look, people can preach religion a hell of a lot better than I can. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1756.48s)]
*  I'm not preaching religion. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1762.8s)]
*  I'm preaching your history. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1764.04s)]
*  Whether you like it or not, and most of you do. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1767.48s)]
*  God is the sovereign. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1772.96s)]
*  That's what the people that wrote the declaration believe. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1775.56s)]
*  That's what the people who fought for your freedom in your country believed. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1777.72s)]
*  Hence God's children. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1783.2s)]
*  When mere mortals are making a government, God's children are the sovereign. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1787.3600000000001s)]
*  The children of God who he created are the sovereign. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1791.32s)]
*  Because he says so. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1796.44s)]
*  You're the sovereign. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1800.24s)]
*  Not a man-made government, not a polar bureau, not a dictator. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1802.44s)]
*  You're the sovereign. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1808.04s)]
*  Okay? [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1811.52s)]
*  Now what did the founders do? [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1812.52s)]
*  Well we know they believed in that. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1818.56s)]
*  That's the declaration. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1821.2s)]
*  And then they write this constitution. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1822.2s)]
*  Right? [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1824.0800000000002s)]
*  I'm going to be doing this all hour. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1826.1599999999999s)]
*  It's very, very important. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1827.1599999999999s)]
*  And again, it's all in my book On Power. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1828.1599999999999s)]
*  If you like what I'm talking about, you find it intriguing and compelling, get the book [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1830.3999999999999s)]
*  because it's explained in much more detail in a book. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1834.32s)]
*  But let me continue. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1837.32s)]
*  This is just part of the book. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1838.32s)]
*  And it relates to everything including this frigging nominee. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1839.32s)]
*  Stick with me. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1844.6399999999999s)]
*  The constitution. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1849.9599999999998s)]
*  Where did they get this stuff about representative government? [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1851.72s)]
*  Now that's not in the Bible. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1855.96s)]
*  That's not in the Torah. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1857.32s)]
*  Consensual government. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1859.8s)]
*  Where does that come from? [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1860.8s)]
*  That you have to divide power, separation of powers. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1861.8s)]
*  That you can't have an overbearing centralized government that lords over you. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1867.24s)]
*  Where did they get this stuff from? [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1872.06s)]
*  The Enlightenment. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1874.2s)]
*  From John Locke, from Montesquieu and others. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1877.92s)]
*  Originally Aristotle, among the Romans Cicero. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1882.1200000000001s)]
*  Many. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1885.6000000000001s)]
*  But your framers of the constitution were focused on Locke and Montesquieu. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1887.3600000000001s)]
*  Montesquieu is mentioned multiple times in the Federalist paper. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1892.0400000000002s)]
*  Now, how do we know they relied on all of this? [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1895.88s)]
*  Because they tell us. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1898.44s)]
*  I include the letter. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1902.5200000000002s)]
*  Thomas Jefferson was asked. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1903.5200000000002s)]
*  He was accused. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1906.72s)]
*  You didn't come up with all these ideas, Jefferson. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1907.72s)]
*  What makes you so great? [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1910.24s)]
*  You didn't come up with all these ideas. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1911.32s)]
*  In effect, that's what the guy wrote him. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1912.6000000000001s)]
*  And he wrote back. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1914.1200000000001s)]
*  I never said I did. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1915.1200000000001s)]
*  I used the accumulated agreed upon knowledge that existed in our country. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1919.76s)]
*  And of course, the declaration speaks of this God seven times. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1927.3600000000001s)]
*  The creator, Providence, so forth. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1935.64s)]
*  And then he cites Aristotle and Cicero and Locke. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1939.44s)]
*  And Montesquieu and others and others. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1945.4s)]
*  He tells us that's what he relied on when he made the first draft of the declaration. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1948.4s)]
*  That's what they embraced. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1953.64s)]
*  All of them. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1954.88s)]
*  So what does that tell you? [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1956.68s)]
*  As I explained in my book. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1957.68s)]
*  Judeo was founded with a fusion of Judeo-Christian values and the Enlightenment. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1960.6s)]
*  Judeo-Christian values and the Enlightenment. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1970.96s)]
*  Now let's turn to Marxism. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1973.52s)]
*  Well, they don't believe in any religious values or faith values. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1976.3999999999999s)]
*  They believe in the elimination of faith. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1979.44s)]
*  They believe the state is the demigod. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1981.56s)]
*  They believe the state gives rights, takes rights, gives freedom, take freedom for the [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1985.6399999999999s)]
*  people. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1990.28s)]
*  Well, of course, the people make all these decisions and we know that's a lie, don't [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1991.28s)]
*  we? [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1993.56s)]
*  People make no decisions. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1994.56s)]
*  There's no democratic aspect to it whatsoever. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1995.56s)]
*  But the proletariat will rise up, destroy the bourgeoisie, destroy the existing vestiges [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=1997.8s)]
*  of any prior society, the chains of prior societies, the feudal systems, agrarian systems, [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2006.2s)]
*  all systems, capitalism. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2012.8s)]
*  The word capitalism was first written by Marx. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2015.96s)]
*  Marx. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2019.64s)]
*  We must destroy what exists, even the family relationship, the nuclear family. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2022.56s)]
*  It must all be destroyed. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2027.44s)]
*  Faith is nothing more than mysticism and it stands in the way of progress and modernity [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2030.1200000000001s)]
*  and all the rest. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2035.1200000000001s)]
*  That's in the book too, just explaining it. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2036.76s)]
*  That's Marxism. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2040.64s)]
*  And the paradise will be the worker's paradise. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2041.64s)]
*  Isn't it funny how they always predict what's going to be the end result? [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2046.6399999999999s)]
*  You can't predict any end result when you're talking about human behavior. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2048.64s)]
*  There's so many fallacies in Marxism and I touch on a number of them in the book. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2051.84s)]
*  But I don't want to talk about Marxism. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2055.24s)]
*  I want to talk about Islamism. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2057.8s)]
*  What does Islamism have in common with Marxism? [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2063.0s)]
*  Why is it that Islamists and Marxists are often the same? [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2065.86s)]
*  Are they marched together in Colombia or UCLA or Harvard or whatever? [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2068.48s)]
*  Why is it that the Marxists like Bernie Sanders and the Islamists like Tlaib, the Marxists [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2073.6s)]
*  like AOC and the Islamists like Omar and down the list, why is it that they form such a [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2079.88s)]
*  tight, tight alliance? [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2086.24s)]
*  Because the means that justify the ends. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2093.04s)]
*  What do the Islamists want? [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2097.52s)]
*  They tell us what they want. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2099.48s)]
*  I don't have to imply anything. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2102.8399999999997s)]
*  Just because they don't read it in the New York Times or they read it and they don't [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2104.7599999999998s)]
*  care, it's irrelevant to me. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2107.16s)]
*  The Islamists want the same thing the Marxists want, the absolute destruction of the West, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2112.48s)]
*  the absolute destruction of Judaism, Christianity and Judeo-Christian values. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2117.12s)]
*  That's what Islamists want. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2122.68s)]
*  That's why they march together. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2126.3999999999996s)]
*  Now you'll say, well, the Islamists, they believe in God. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2129.4s)]
*  The Marxists don't. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2134.04s)]
*  Doesn't matter. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2135.04s)]
*  It's only when, if they take the world over that that will become relevant. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2137.64s)]
*  Then they fight among themselves and decide, it's almost like Trotsky and Stalin, two communists [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2142.68s)]
*  who fight and decide, no, this is the way we rule. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2148.72s)]
*  No, this is the way that we rule. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2150.7999999999997s)]
*  Not an exact parallel, but good enough. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2152.48s)]
*  The Islamists and the Marxists at some point, God forbid if we don't exist anymore. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2156.78s)]
*  And by the way, it's not just Jews and Christians. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2161.46s)]
*  It's Muslims who don't believe what they believe. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2164.1800000000003s)]
*  It's Hindus, it's Buddhists, it's atheists, it's agnostic. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2166.0600000000004s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2168.78s)]
*  You don't conform. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2171.3s)]
*  You don't conform for Marxism, you die. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2172.34s)]
*  You don't conform for Islamism, you die. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2174.78s)]
*  Nothing else matters. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2178.1800000000003s)]
*  One says it's the calling of paradise on earth. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2180.46s)]
*  The other says it's the only way to serve our God. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2184.7s)]
*  It's the only way that we can reach our God is destroy all this, all this other stuff [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2189.08s)]
*  that's in between. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2193.66s)]
*  That's what they write. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2195.3799999999997s)]
*  That's what they say. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2196.66s)]
*  That's what they believe. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2198.0s)]
*  That's why the regime in Iran, unless it is completely obliterated, is not gone away. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2201.8599999999997s)]
*  And neither are their nuclear ambitions. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2208.22s)]
*  It's different from saying Trump should do it, the Israelis should do it, the world should [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2212.06s)]
*  do it. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2215.54s)]
*  I'm not getting into that right now. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2216.54s)]
*  I'm talking about the mindset. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2217.54s)]
*  And so of course, Islamists are the enemy. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2223.1s)]
*  They're our enemy. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2225.58s)]
*  They're the enemy of Americanism. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2226.58s)]
*  They're the enemy of the West. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2229.86s)]
*  That's what they are. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2233.14s)]
*  That's why they say death to America, death to Israel. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2235.24s)]
*  Death to everybody who disagrees with us, everybody. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2238.7400000000002s)]
*  And now one of them is the Democrat nominee for mayor of New York. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2246.34s)]
*  Does that mean he's a terrorist and wants to kill everybody? [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2253.5s)]
*  No, of course not. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2255.94s)]
*  In order to westernize the revolution, and we know this from among other things, the [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2261.1600000000003s)]
*  1993 bugging of a hotel room at the Marriott outside the Philadelphia International Airport [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2266.18s)]
*  where Hamasians met, and they created care. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2270.7799999999997s)]
*  And everything they said was taken down. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2276.4199999999996s)]
*  And among other things, it's available, a lot of it, for you on the internet. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2279.06s)]
*  For the New York Times, if you want to take a look. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2282.3399999999997s)]
*  And by the way, as a footnote, to call Charlie Kirk a racist makes me sick to my stomach. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2284.8199999999997s)]
*  He and I don't always agree, but he's earnest, okay? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2291.74s)]
*  He's not a racist. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2295.02s)]
*  He's not an anti-Semite. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2296.02s)]
*  Some people are. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2297.86s)]
*  Some people are. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2299.1s)]
*  And I've called them out. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2300.1s)]
*  He's not one of them. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2301.1s)]
*  That's my two cents. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2305.22s)]
*  And so what they decided to do is sort of Americanize themselves, get people elected [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2308.86s)]
*  to Congress, get people in the media, create care which would claim to be the greatest [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2313.22s)]
*  civil rights, Muslim civil rights organization in America where they push the agenda. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2318.18s)]
*  To try to take over cities, state governments, local governments, have a big presence in [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2324.86s)]
*  Congress. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2332.7000000000003s)]
*  They play the long game. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2333.7000000000003s)]
*  We do not in the West. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2336.78s)]
*  We don't play any game. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2338.98s)]
*  Half the time we don't even know. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2339.98s)]
*  You know, they're playing football and we're playing bocce. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2342.5s)]
*  It's like that. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2344.62s)]
*  So this guy is the Democrat nominee for the mayor of New York City, is both a Marxist [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2348.06s)]
*  and an Islamist. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2356.38s)]
*  They keep it. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2357.38s)]
*  He's a socialist. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2358.38s)]
*  He's not a socialist. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2359.38s)]
*  He's a Marxist. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2360.38s)]
*  Socialism is bad enough. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2362.14s)]
*  That's an economic theory. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2363.94s)]
*  It's not an ideological doctrine. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2367.08s)]
*  He's a Marxist who believes in socialism and he's an Islamist. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2369.5s)]
*  He said so and then denied it. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2374.98s)]
*  He's an anti-Semite. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2377.66s)]
*  Oh, no, I'm not. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2378.66s)]
*  Just because I favor BDS, just because I'm opposed to Zionism, which means the state [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2381.46s)]
*  of Israel. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2385.5s)]
*  That's what it means. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2386.5s)]
*  Just because I believe in the globalization of the Intifada, the globalization of terrorism. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2387.62s)]
*  No, no, no, I don't mean that. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2392.2599999999998s)]
*  You know, it's just a phrase of oppressed people. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2394.94s)]
*  Now you know. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2399.7799999999997s)]
*  It's in the book On Power. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2400.7799999999997s)]
*  Grab your copy because it's going to be relevant throughout the next 10 years. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2403.1s)]
*  The Great One makes your weekend even better. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2408.5s)]
*  This is the best of Mark Levin. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2422.18s)]
*  By the way, let's say this. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2425.46s)]
*  Stick with me. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2428.8599999999997s)]
*  They're trying to diminish the accomplishment that took place. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2431.2599999999998s)]
*  We have the isolationists who didn't want the accomplishment to take place. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2434.86s)]
*  And if they had their way, Iran, let me even step back. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2439.02s)]
*  If they had had their way, Israel would never have attacked Iran because Israel was waiting [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2443.2200000000003s)]
*  for the United States to give the word that they would that we would back them in their [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2449.9s)]
*  endeavors. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2455.94s)]
*  And the president did that. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2456.94s)]
*  So that's where it really starts. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2459.42s)]
*  Even before we get to the taking out of their nuclear sites. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2460.58s)]
*  And it's just fantastic what this president did. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2467.42s)]
*  So you can see where the Jew haters, the Israel haters and truthfully, the fake MAGA, the [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2470.34s)]
*  six percent, the six percent, 94 percent of MAGA supported what took place. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2476.42s)]
*  The six percenters. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2481.38s)]
*  So I say, abandon these people, folks, abandon them. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2482.38s)]
*  They're crazy. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2485.94s)]
*  Pete Hagseth at a press conference at the NATO summit today. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2487.7799999999997s)]
*  Cut three, go. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2490.58s)]
*  There's a reason the president calls out fake news for what it is. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2491.8199999999997s)]
*  These pilots, these refuelers, these fighters, these air defenders, the skill and the courage [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2496.02s)]
*  it took to go into enemy territory, flying 36 hours on behalf of the American people [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2502.58s)]
*  in the world to take out a nuclear program is beyond what anyone in this audience can [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2506.4599999999996s)]
*  fathom. And then the instinct, the instinct of CNN, the instinct of the New York Times [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2511.06s)]
*  is to try to find a way to spin it for their own political reasons, to try to hurt President [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2517.9799999999996s)]
*  Trump or our country. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2524.74s)]
*  They don't care what the troops think. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2526.2599999999998s)]
*  They don't care what the world thinks. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2527.8199999999997s)]
*  They want to spin it to try to make him look bad based on a leak. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2529.4199999999996s)]
*  Of course, we've all seen plenty of leakers and what leakers do. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2533.18s)]
*  They have agendas. And what do they do? [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2535.9399999999996s)]
*  Do they share the whole information or just the part that they want to introduce? [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2537.74s)]
*  And when they introduce that preliminary, a preliminary report that's deemed to be [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2542.62s)]
*  low, a low assessment, you know, a low assessment means low confidence in the data in that [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2548.66s)]
*  report. And why is there low confidence? [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2554.5s)]
*  Because all of the evidence of what was just bombed by 12,000, 30,000 pound bombs is buried [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2556.5s)]
*  under a mountain devastated and obliterated. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2563.3s)]
*  So if you want to make an assessment of what happened at Fordo, you better get a big shovel [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2566.42s)]
*  and go really deep because Iran's nuclear program is obliterated. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2571.54s)]
*  And somebody somewhere is trying to leak something to say, oh, with low confidence, we [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2576.02s)]
*  think maybe it's moderate. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2581.46s)]
*  Those that drop the bombs precisely in the right place know exactly what happened when [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2583.38s)]
*  that exploded. And you know who else knows Iran? [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2589.38s)]
*  That's why they came to the table right away, because their nuclear capabilities have been [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2592.2999999999997s)]
*  set back beyond what they thought were possible because of the courage of a commander in [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2596.66s)]
*  chief who led our troops, despite what the fake news wants to say. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2602.2599999999998s)]
*  And the president, Sarah Nadeau, and he's actually having to defend or. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2607.58s)]
*  Parry with the media that that's attacking him. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2612.5s)]
*  Now, ladies and gentlemen, this country has been in many wars, many military battles and [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2617.98s)]
*  events. We've never had a media like this that roots against us. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2622.2999999999997s)]
*  We've never had a fifth column like this of Democrats who want to impeach a president for [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2627.62s)]
*  doing exactly what he's able to do and doing it beautifully, flawlessly, brilliantly. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2631.46s)]
*  As well as the isolationists. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2636.38s)]
*  The same media is celebrating this guy, Zoran Momdai, or however the hell you pronounce [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2640.54s)]
*  it. You understand what I mean? [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2647.06s)]
*  Your instincts about the media are correct. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2649.42s)]
*  They covered up for Biden. They covered up the laptop. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2651.62s)]
*  They hate us. It's not just Trump. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2653.98s)]
*  He's the point of the spear. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2656.34s)]
*  They'd love him to go to prison. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2658.0600000000004s)]
*  That's not the point. He represents us. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2659.7400000000002s)]
*  That's why they hate him. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2662.38s)]
*  If he was one. You remember when it was the reform party, the Democrat Party, he was [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2663.78s)]
*  donating here and there. He was doing the deals as a businessman does in many instances. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2668.5800000000004s)]
*  They loved him. Then when he identifies with the Republican Party, that's it. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2673.5800000000004s)]
*  That's the end. He didn't even have to open his mouth. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2678.34s)]
*  That was it right there. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2680.5s)]
*  Honestly, just like Elon Musk. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2681.62s)]
*  Votes for Obama. He's great. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2687.9s)]

*  Donations to. He's great. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2692.1s)]
*  Signs up, joins with Trump. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2694.2999999999997s)]
*  Assists big time in the election. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2697.7799999999997s)]
*  Runs this doge and they're out to literally destroy him and imprison him, too. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2700.7s)]
*  That's what they do. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2709.54s)]
*  Very well said, Pete. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2712.62s)]
*  Very well said. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2715.22s)]
*  Rubio was quite good at this summit, too. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2718.46s)]
*  Cut seven, Mr. Producer, go. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2721.46s)]
*  First of all, on the stuff about the intelligence, this is what a leaker is telling you. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2723.94s)]
*  The intelligence says that's the game these people play. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2728.18s)]
*  They read it and then they go out and characterize it the way they want to characterize. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2730.54s)]
*  And they're leakers. This is the game they play. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2734.2599999999998s)]
*  So that's number one. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2736.14s)]
*  Number two. Here's a fact. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2737.18s)]
*  The conversion facility, which you can't do a nuclear weapon without a conversion facility. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2738.82s)]
*  We can't even find where it is, where it used to be on the map. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2743.78s)]
*  You can't even find where it used to be because the whole thing is blackened out. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2746.5s)]
*  It's gone. It's wiped out. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2749.42s)]
*  It's wiped out. Then we dropped 12 of the strongest bombs on the planet right down the hole in two places. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2750.58s)]
*  Everything underneath that mountain is in bad shape. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2756.42s)]
*  And I refer you to the statement of the IAEA, Mr. Grossi. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2759.1400000000003s)]
*  You know what he said? [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2762.46s)]
*  He said there was Iran the way it looked the day before the attack and what their nuclear program [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2763.38s)]
*  looks like now. Two very different things. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2768.22s)]
*  They are way behind where they were just seven days ago. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2770.3399999999997s)]
*  Now anything in the world can be rebuilt. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2773.14s)]
*  But now we know where it is. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2775.46s)]
*  And if they try to rebuild it, we'll have options there as well. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2776.8599999999997s)]
*  But all this leaker stuff, these leakers are professional stabbers. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2779.14s)]
*  That's what they are. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2783.02s)]
*  They go out and they read this stuff and then they tell you what it says against the law. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2783.94s)]
*  But they characterize it for you in a way that's absolutely false. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2788.8999999999996s)]
*  There's no way Iran comes to the table. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2792.58s)]
*  Somehow nothing had happened. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2794.2999999999997s)]
*  And this is complete and total obliteration. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2795.46s)]
*  They're in bad shape. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2798.5s)]
*  They are way behind today compared to where they were just seven days ago because of what the president. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2799.46s)]
*  The Mossad says the same thing. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2805.3s)]
*  The Mossad's all over that country. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2807.14s)]
*  I think we've learned that. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2809.58s)]
*  But these leakers are trying to undermine the great men and women of the military and what they've [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2812.58s)]
*  accomplished because they they're trying to destroy Donald Trump. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2817.18s)]
*  It's not going to work. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2820.18s)]
*  The American people are patriotic. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2822.18s)]
*  What the Democrats are doing is not going to work. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2824.82s)]
*  The American people are patriotic. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2826.86s)]
*  The isolationists, I have revealed them. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2828.46s)]
*  I've been the point of the spear. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2831.5s)]
*  You now know that Tucker Carlson is Chatsworth Katarlson. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2832.78s)]
*  That's his name. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2837.22s)]

*  So you now know he's pardon me Bannon. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2850.02s)]

*  It's humble. It's in the public record. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2860.66s)]
*  You could do it yourself, by the way. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2862.06s)]

*  It's just too easy, if you know what I mean. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2931.98s)]
*  So I'm going to. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2933.66s)]
*  We leave her alone. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2936.3799999999997s)]

*  Fat boy and prep boy, two different stories. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2942.1s)]

*  depending on how it goes, depending on how [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2962.8199999999997s)]
*  how they try and undermine our military, undermine our president, undermine our country, [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2966.62s)]
*  how much grifting they're doing, how many lies they're telling, [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2970.3799999999997s)]
*  how much anti-Semitism they're spreading. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2973.06s)]

*  I really would. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=2983.3399999999997s)]

*  First, it's the War Powers Act. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3030.1800000000003s)]
*  Then it's impeachment. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3033.06s)]
*  But they tamped that down because they thought that would blow up in their face [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3035.94s)]

*  They got many of the retailers very up, we can't put that book on the shelves. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3073.58s)]

*  On Power, it's going to be everywhere. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3081.94s)]

*  They're going to carry my book and they've already increased the order. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3092.94s)]
*  My book's going to have more books in Costco's than most other books, [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3098.94s)]
*  which don't even appear anymore. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3103.54s)]
*  I'm just telling you, this is going to take off. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3104.94s)]
*  I want you to be part of this. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3106.94s)]

*  I'm very, very anxious that you embrace this because you're going to love it. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3111.94s)]
*  I gave you a little feel for it, just a tiny, [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3115.94s)]
*  which you can get at Amazon.com right now, about 24 bucks. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3117.94s)]
*  And let's say 10,000 of you, just 10,000. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3122.94s)]
*  That's it. There's millions of you out there. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3125.94s)]
*  10,000 of you go in there, order the book. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3127.94s)]
*  That discount will get even bigger and the more that order. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3130.94s)]
*  I've seen that discount with my books go to 50 percent, 50 percent. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3133.94s)]
*  This is why I say don't wait. You're going to wait till the end. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3138.94s)]
*  Get the accumulated benefit, Levinites, of this audience of getting a huge discount. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3142.94s)]
*  I know how their system works. They only want me to tell you. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3146.94s)]
*  I'm telling you, the more pre-orders they get, the greater the discount. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3149.94s)]
*  This book could wind up costing you, what, 15 bucks, depending on how it goes. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3153.94s)]
*  We're giving you nothing but the best, the best of Mark Levin. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3168.94s)]
*  By the way, on this, this great big bill, I could be wrong. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3173.94s)]
*  If the Senate's making it look better, I'd like to know how. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3179.94s)]
*  The House Republicans, to their great credit, they looked at Medicaid. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3184.94s)]
*  They saw legal aliens were getting Medicaid. They wanted to tighten it up. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3188.94s)]
*  They see that individuals who are sound of mind and body, who won't work at least 20 hours a week, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3192.94s)]
*  were getting Medicaid, which is a welfare program. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3199.94s)]
*  So they wanted to fix that and have a stronger work requirement in there and a couple things like that. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3202.94s)]
*  So the Senate parliamentarian, who is a bureaucrat, has apparently ruled that that's not part of a budget process. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3208.94s)]
*  That's more policy oriented and therefore does not fit within the reconciliation process. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3217.94s)]
*  Now, what's all that jargon mean? [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3223.94s)]
*  What it means is, if you put it in the bill, the bill is subject to a filibuster as opposed to just a majority. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3224.94s)]
*  And we know what the Democrats would do with it. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3231.94s)]
*  So Senator Thune, as I read the various press reports, has said that he will not, [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3233.94s)]
*  he will not overturn the parliamentarian's decision. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3239.94s)]
*  So now if this bill passes, it means that all this fraud and waste that's going to individuals who shouldn't get it under Medicaid, they'll get it. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3243.94s)]
*  OK, I'm cutting to the chase. No Washington, D.C. jargon. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3251.94s)]
*  Number two, I guess some of the minority on this with some people, I don't think with you, but I think inside Washington, [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3256.94s)]
*  these deductions for home mortgage interest and property taxes, there used to be no cap on that. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3263.94s)]
*  None whatsoever. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3271.94s)]
*  None. But then they put a ten thousand dollar cap on it. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3273.94s)]
*  Because their view is, well, that'll cover most people. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3279.94s)]
*  And so the Republicans went back and quite frankly, some of the Republicans from Northeastern states where taxes are ridiculous. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3283.94s)]
*  They got it to go up. I think it was to forty thousand dollars. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3292.94s)]
*  Now, that doesn't mean most of you need a forty thousand dollar tax deduction. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3295.94s)]
*  But this isn't just about Frank over there and Sally over there and Hakeem over there and so forth and so on. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3299.94s)]
*  It's what's best for the country. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3305.94s)]
*  My attitude is always if you can keep more of your money, you earned it. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3308.94s)]
*  You earned it and you should keep as much as possible. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3312.94s)]
*  This is Ron DeSantis's view here in Florida, where there's no income tax. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3314.94s)]
*  All taxes are low except for these property taxes and the state is nothing to do with it. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3319.94s)]
*  It's the selfish, damnable counties paying off teachers unions and everything else. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3324.94s)]
*  So the property taxes are fairly high in Florida and the state has no direct control over it. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3330.94s)]
*  So he wants to address that. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3338.94s)]
*  Well, in a lot of states, a lot of you Republicans live in blue or purple states and your property taxes are significant. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3341.94s)]
*  And so it seems the position of the Senate Republicans and they're not the only ones is screw you. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3349.94s)]
*  You live in a blue state. They have to lower the property taxes. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3354.94s)]
*  Otherwise, you're going to suffer. No, that's not the way it's supposed to work. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3357.94s)]
*  At the federal level, we're talking about taxes. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3366.94s)]
*  We should be able to keep as much as we can, whatever the state property taxes are. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3369.94s)]
*  It's not about rewarding this state or that state. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3374.94s)]
*  If you have mega people living in New York, living in California, living in Illinois, you know, they don't we don't all live in one little neighborhood. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3378.94s)]
*  They should be able to have as much of a tax deduction as possible as anybody else. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3388.94s)]
*  No, but we're going to punish the blue state. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3394.94s)]
*  What do you mean punish? [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3396.94s)]
*  You're talking about individual citizens. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3398.94s)]
*  It's their money. It's your money. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3400.94s)]
*  That's my view. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3402.94s)]
*  I remember when Regulus president, we had massive slash of taxes across the board. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3404.94s)]
*  You know what we had? [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3409.94s)]
*  He got rid of the inheritance tax because you've already paid taxes on that money. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3410.94s)]
*  And so it was zero, zero, not today. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3417.94s)]
*  And then when it came to interest deductions of property tax reductions, there was no cap. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3423.94s)]
*  No cap on that. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3428.94s)]
*  No inheritance tax. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3430.94s)]
*  And you know what happened, ladies and gentlemen, massive economic growth. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3432.94s)]
*  For the years that Donald Trump was president, our economy grew by almost one third. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3438.94s)]
*  The entire damn economy grew by almost one third because of his tax program. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3443.94s)]
*  So the Republicans are acting like kind of rhinos. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3449.94s)]
*  Well, the Senate says we're not going to go along with this house thing of forty thousand dollar deduction. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3454.94s)]
*  We're going to go back to ten. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3462.94s)]
*  Why? [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3463.94s)]
*  Well, we don't want to benefit these these blue states. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3464.94s)]
*  We never even had those arguments during the Reagan administration. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3468.94s)]
*  It wasn't a matter of blue states, red states, purple states, polka dot states. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3471.94s)]
*  It was a matter of the individual taxpayer. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3475.94s)]
*  They're the ones who pay the taxes, not the state government of New York and California and Illinois and Rhode Island. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3478.94s)]
*  A real human being with a family. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3485.94s)]
*  You pay the taxes. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3487.94s)]
*  So I have a strong desire to pay taxes. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3489.94s)]
*  I have a strong desire to pay taxes. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3493.94s)]
*  So, you know, you get a program that's full of bloat and fraud with illegal aliens and people who can work able bodied, able minded people who won't work. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3495.94s)]
*  And So I have a strong disagreement with the Senate on this and a strong disagreement with with the Majority Leader. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3506.94s)]
*  He should override the Parliamentarian. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3517.94s)]
*  We didn't vote for the Parliamentarian. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3520.94s)]

*  about Marxism a [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3715.1800000000003s)]
*  Couple of things that you'll learn from the book on power as well [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3717.26s)]
*  Marxism was always flawed for a number of reasons number one [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3720.7000000000003s)]
*  The great second Industrial Revolution began in around 1870 [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3724.6200000000003s)]
*  Most of what Marx and Engels wrote [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3733.1800000000003s)]
*  Preceded 1870 [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3736.1s)]
*  They saw the first Industrial Revolution which which was okay [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3738.7799999999997s)]
*  But it was the second one where there was this explosion of growth and inventions and development and so forth and so on [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3742.16s)]
*  When Marx was writing about capitalism a word he termed that didn't exist [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3749.66s)]
*  It didn't even exist [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3756.2999999999997s)]
*  Number two Marxism and all these other isms [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3761.66s)]
*  That predict [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3765.8199999999997s)]
*  The promised land the end of society [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3768.3399999999997s)]
*  Are flawed how can you predict the end of society? I don't mean that it will end but that [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3773.66s)]
*  What the the final society will look like how where how do you know that? [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3779.8599999999997s)]
*  See, we don't do that here [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3786.66s)]
*  Our system isn't set up that way [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3789.54s)]
*  That we're gonna do this this this and this to meet the promised land to get to the promise that's not what we do [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3792.2599999999998s)]
*  We set up a realistic system. We have [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3797.5s)]
*  Our founders did framers through the Constitution [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3800.94s)]
*  To live by day by day. We hope to preserve it for our children and grandchildren as long as we possibly can [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3805.02s)]
*  But we don't say [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3812.5s)]
*  The American government at the very end at the pinnacle is gonna look like X [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3814.7799999999997s)]
*  No, we don't and yet Marxist do that Islamists do that [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3818.66s)]
*  It's another great [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3824.06s)]
*  Fault as I explained in the book [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3827.34s)]
*  But I also explained in the book to counter this [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3831.74s)]
*  This marks they keep calling him a socialist socialism is an economic policy and mark said [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3835.06s)]
*  socialism is [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3840.66s)]
*  the last step before [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3841.98s)]
*  communism [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3844.22s)]
*  So when I talk about this guy [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3846.8199999999997s)]
*  Zoran Mamdani, he's a Marxist. He supports economic socialism just like AOC [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3849.66s)]
*  Just like Bernie Sanders and so forth. Okay [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3855.7799999999997s)]
*  Now use this word Marxism when I used it on talk radio on Fox nobody would use it they kept saying socialism [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3859.66s)]
*  Progressivism left-wingism and so I would tell them I would tell them off air and on stop it and [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3866.74s)]
*  Stop calling them progressives. That's their own nomenclature. They gave it to themselves. They're not progressive [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3872.9s)]
*  Marxism so now you hear the word Marxist [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgMesxG75VE&t=3878.66s)]
