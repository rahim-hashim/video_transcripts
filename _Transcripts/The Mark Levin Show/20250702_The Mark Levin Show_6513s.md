Video Description: On Wednesday’s Mark Levin Show, it’s time for a Levin surge to tell your member of Congress to vote yes for the big, beautiful bill. Yes, there are certain issues that matter to us all that are not addressed as we would wish, but there are many very important provisions in this bill that must be enacted from tax cuts and more resources for detaining and deporting criminal illegal aliens! There is a miniscule majority in the House. If there was a larger majority the outcome might be different, but IF is not reality. In ‘On Power’ negative power is maintained through manipulative communication techniques like deception, fearmongering, and intimidation, designed to suppress independent thought and arouse prejudice. This approach aims to control populations by undermining morality and open democratic societies, denying citizens the information needed for informed decisions. Such language seeks to incite destructive actions that serve the demagogue’s goals, corrupting the legitimate consent of the governed. This is exactly what’s going on today with Democrats such as Rep Hakeem Jeffries, Rep Nancy Pelosi and Zohran Mamdani. The Democrat party sounds like a Stalinist party. Later, the district attorney is incompetent and immoral for striking a plea deal that allows Bryan Kohberger to live, despite the defense’s claims of innocence and attempts to distract from the evidence. It’s unjust that taxpayers must fund Kohberger’s life in prison while good people lost their lives too soon. The legal system’s handling of this case was utterly immoral. Also, in Democracy in America, Alexis de Tocqueville warns that America’s democracy could falter under the weight of a vast administrative state. He describes this state as an overreaching, paternalistic power that, while mild and providential, seeks to manage every aspect of citizens’ lives—security, needs, pleasures, and property. We see this happening in NYC. Finally, Rep Jim Jordan calls in to explain that the big, beautiful bill is as good as it gets. You know this is a good bill because Democrats hate it.  This bill empowers Americans through tax cuts, including eliminating taxes on tips, promoting school choice, and implementing work requirements for welfare recipients.  This bill strengthens border security with more ICE agents, detention spaces, and funding for the wall.

# The Big, Beautiful Bill: Why We Can’t Afford to Wait
**The Mark Levin Show:** [July 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU)
*  Ladies and gentlemen, this next segment of the podcast is brought to you by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=0.0s)]
*  For over 50 years, the Great Heritage Foundation has been America's outpost in Washington, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=4.8s)]
*  fighting against the D.C. federal bureaucracy and working to secure a future that allows Americans [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=9.52s)]
*  to live the good life. For too long, common sense principles have been ignored by many of the very [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=14.64s)]
*  leaders claiming to fight for America, but the Heritage Foundation is proud to hold our leaders [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=19.28s)]
*  accountable and stand up for America's founding principles, paid for by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=23.6s)]
*  He's here. Now, broadcasting from the underground command post, deep in the bowels of a hidden [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=30.48s)]
*  bunker, somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=38.0s)]
*  we once again make contact with our leader, Mark LeVein. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  Hello America, Mark LeVein here, our number 877-381-3811, 877-381-3811. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=120.0s)]
*  It's time for a rare but necessary LeVein surge, America. All you patriots out there. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=133.44s)]
*  Please call your member of the House through the Capitol Hill switchboard, 202-224-3121. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=140.96s)]
*  I'm posting it on my social sites, 202-224-3121. Yes, there are certain issues that matter to us [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=147.76s)]
*  all that are not addressed as we would wish in this bill, but there are many, many very important [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=155.12s)]
*  provisions in this bill that must be enacted, and if we don't get the bill enacted, there's going to [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=160.0s)]
*  be a massive tax increase. There won't be enough ice to protect us on the border. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=165.76s)]
*  There are Medicaid issues. We don't want illegal aliens getting Medicaid, and we don't want [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=172.0s)]
*  able-bodied men and women who refuse to put in 20 hours a week getting Medicaid either. That's not [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=175.92s)]
*  what Medicaid was ever for. We have a minuscule majority in the House of Representatives. Like it [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=181.92s)]
*  or not, it matters. If we had 30, 40, 50 more conservatives in the House and maybe 10 more [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=188.39999999999998s)]
*  conservatives in the Senate, you and I could impose our will, but as it is now, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=195.76s)]
*  Donald Trump has done everything humanly possible to get the very best bill he can. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=200.88s)]
*  We can sit here and twirl our thumbs and whine about it. You've got individuals who want to beat [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=207.6s)]
*  their chests. That's all well and good, but this is where we are. This is what we have. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=213.27999999999997s)]
*  There's a reason why the Democrats are jumping up and down in opposition to this bill. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=221.27999999999997s)]
*  So I want to strongly encourage you, my fellow patriots, Levinites, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=225.28s)]
*  this is one of those rare occasions when we use the Levin surge, as we have in the past decades, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=231.6s)]
*  to block legislation and to support tax cuts. There are tax cuts in this bill [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=239.52s)]
*  that should positively affect the vast majority of you in my House, and I'm sure you know that. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  The vast majority. So it is time for Levin surge, it is time for patriots to come together [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=255.28s)]
*  to make your voice heard, to flood the Capitol Hill switchboard, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=267.44s)]
*  starting right now, 202-224-3121. That number will be on all my social sites. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=272.16s)]
*  202-224-3121. I remember when I served in the Reagan administration for eight years, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=278.24s)]
*  no bill was good enough. A massive tax cut. I remember it, in August of 1981. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=289.12s)]
*  And you had people saying, well, there'll be massive deficits and the cuts don't go far enough. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=299.84000000000003s)]
*  The greatest tax cuts in American history. These will now be the greatest tax cuts in [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=305.04s)]
*  American history. And the truth is, it created extraordinary growth in our economy. Our economy [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=309.92s)]
*  exploded with growth. Business creation and entrepreneurs. It exploded with growth. Job [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=316.72s)]
*  creation across the board. This will do the same thing. And now having learned from what the [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=322.88s)]
*  Democrats and the Rinos did with the Reagan tax cuts, kept spending and spending and spending. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=331.2s)]
*  You have a President, Trump, who has seen that, who knows about it. We all do. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=337.03999999999996s)]
*  So we learn from experience, we learn from history, it's called knowledge. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=342.32s)]
*  We may never have an opportunity like this again, America. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=350.08s)]
*  So this is now an official event surge. I'll be reminding you of it throughout the three hours of [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=353.28000000000003s)]
*  the program. The Capitol Hill switchboard is 202-224-3121. Is the bill perfect? I don't want [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=358.32s)]
*  to hear about that anymore. Are these members of Congress perfect? No, I can't stand most of them. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=365.68s)]
*  But that's beside the point! 202-224-3121. Wherever you are in your country, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=370.16s)]
*  in your car, in rush hour, at the dinner table, at some event this summer, some wonderful event, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=379.76000000000005s)]
*  it takes nothing to pull out your iPhone or whatever kind of phone you have and make the call. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=390.24s)]
*  202-224-3121. Ask for the office of your member of the House of Representatives and say, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=395.04s)]
*  I politely, I want you to vote for the Trump bill, period. Well, what about this? I'm not interested. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=401.44s)]
*  I want you to vote for the Trump bill. Ladies and gentlemen, we wouldn't even be here if [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=411.2s)]
*  Donald Trump wasn't elected president of the United States. We wouldn't even be here if his [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=417.2s)]
*  co-deals didn't elect the Republicans to take over the Senate. We wouldn't even be here. We [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=421.6s)]
*  wouldn't have a House majority but for Donald Trump. The stars are aligned. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=426.08s)]
*  The stars are aligned. We can't keep hearing people say, he's the greatest president of my [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=434.47999999999996s)]
*  lifetime. He's had the greatest six months of any president. And then the Republicans in the Congress [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=438.71999999999997s)]
*  thwart him. We can't have that. 202-224-3121. A Levin surge. All patriots. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=445.12s)]
*  Don't leave it to somebody else. Don't figure it'll get done. I'm imploring you, we need your help. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=455.92s)]
*  Just like an election night. Just like an election night. I implored you. Get to the polls. Get out [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=462.48s)]
*  of your cars. Drive to the precincts. I'm imploring you again. This is a positive thing [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=467.84s)]
*  you'll be doing. Positive for your own family. Positive for the country. Now, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=475.91999999999996s)]
*  I want to play you some clips of the enemy, aka the Democrats. I want to play you some clips [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=483.44s)]
*  and then I want to address this in a very thorough Levin-like way. It's very important. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=491.84s)]
*  First, we go to Zahran Mamdani, the Marxist Islamist, America-hating, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=497.84s)]
*  Jew-hating, Democrat nominee for mayor. Let us not forget. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=505.35999999999996s)]
*  Let's go. Cut to in a campaign video. Go. Go further toward the Vienna model. We'll have to go [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=512.88s)]
*  beyond the market. We can establish community land trusts to gradually buy up housing on the [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=518.8s)]
*  private market and convert it to community ownership. We can give tenants the right of [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=523.2s)]
*  first refusal to buy out their landlords when buildings go up for sale. And we can fully commit [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=527.2s)]
*  to a new era of social housing, ending subsidies for luxury housing development and using our wealth [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=531.76s)]
*  to build beautiful, high-quality social housing projects that offer good homes and strong [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=537.2s)]
*  communities to everyone. We won't decommodify housing overnight, but we know what we have to do [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=542.08s)]
*  and we have history to guide us. All right, cut seven. This is Maxwell Frost, Democrat, Florida. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=547.84s)]
*  Go. That clip you posted earlier when he was asked about the health care system, even the way he [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=554.96s)]
*  answered the question was the first thing he said. Hold on, hold on, hold on, please. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=559.6800000000001s)]
*  When Vance was asked about the health care system. Go ahead. That clip you posted earlier when he [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=563.2s)]
*  was asked about the health care system, even the way he answered the question, what's the first [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=568.1600000000001s)]
*  thing he said? He brought up the business of rural health care. He didn't bring up making sure [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=571.44s)]
*  humans in rural America are healthy, the business. And that's the thing is it's all a business. It's [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=576.96s)]
*  all making money to these guys. And it's not a new thing. The Republican party has been about this [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=581.76s)]
*  for generations. They have someone in Donald Trump now who's a billionaire himself who wants to do it [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=586.32s)]
*  to such a degree that where people will die. Hacking Jeffries just said this on a call I got [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=591.76s)]
*  off. He said, if this passes, the floor of the house will become a crime scene. And I fully agree [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=597.2s)]
*  with that characterization. It's it's murder. It's killing people. See, it was unbelievable [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=602.4s)]
*  to stick with me. And here is Hacking Jeffries. He just mentioned cut eight, go. And as a result, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=610.0799999999999s)]
*  people are going to die. Connected to this one big ugly bill. Tens of thousands of unnecessary [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=615.84s)]
*  American deaths per year. Shame on Republicans for even bringing this bill to the House floor. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=626.24s)]
*  So all we need are four Republicans to join us [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=636.4s)]
*  in support of their constituents to have John McCain level courage and stand up in defense. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=640.4s)]
*  They hated McCain too, by the way, as you may recall. Go ahead. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=649.6800000000001s)]
*  Of the American people. All right. One more Pelosi on the floor today. Cut 10. Go. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=655.2s)]
*  The gentleman just ended by saying to vote for this big, beautiful bill. This big, beautiful bill. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=662.32s)]
*  Well, if beauty is in the eye of the beholder, then you, GOP, you have a very blurred vision [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=669.44s)]
*  of what America is about. Is it beautiful to cut off food from seniors and children? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=675.68s)]
*  Is it beautiful to cut off? She's slurring her speech now. Time to hang it up, don't you think? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=683.04s)]
*  Go ahead. People from health care. Is it beautiful to do this to give tax cuts to billionaires in our [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=688.8s)]
*  country? Is it beautiful, beautiful to take money from education and the rest? The list goes on and [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=696.4799999999999s)]
*  on. Dr. King nearly 60 years ago said of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=703.52s)]
*  is the most shocking and the most inhuman because it often results in physical death. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=710.96s)]
*  We come to this floor with a moral force of Dr. King's words in our heart. Let us not with this [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=717.12s)]
*  bill turn the American dream he talked about in a nightmare for America's seniors, the disabled, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=723.68s)]
*  our children, our children, our children. Let us vote no on the shameful bill and throw a punch [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=731.28s)]
*  for the children. Sounds like she's been drinking the punch. Don't you think, Mr. Producer? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=737.76s)]
*  I'm going to take a break now. We're going to take some time to break this down. This is very, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=747.04s)]
*  very important because this is what we hear more and more of this, how they sell you the pie in the [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=750.48s)]
*  sky and if you don't agree with them, you're out to kill people and starve children. And I've had [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=756.8s)]
*  about enough of this. So we'll be right back. President Trump is in Washington with a mandate [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=761.5999999999999s)]

*  and restore American greatness. But since January 20, judges across our country have consistently [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=778.64s)]
*  been blocking President Trump's attempts to fulfill his mandate. The Heritage Foundation [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=784.64s)]
*  has been analyzing the situation and they've been able to identify the legal issues with these [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=789.1999999999999s)]
*  judges' actions as well as the solutions that can end this potential crisis. Now to see the results [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=794.16s)]

*  protect Americans and take back our nation. So go to heritage.org slash Levin, that's heritage.org [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=817.6800000000001s)]

*  You just are. And I'm blessed to have you out there and we're gonna really take a chunk out of [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=842.72s)]
*  this now and discuss what's actually going on. And we're going to do it through On Power, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=848.8000000000001s)]
*  chapter four on language. And I think you'll see why I'm trying to promote certain ideas and arguments [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=857.6s)]
*  because we are surrounded by these cultural, political, and governmental evils. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=866.4s)]
*  So when it comes to language, I point out the pursuit and maintenance of negative power, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=875.52s)]
*  which is what the left stands for. Require the utilization of negative techniques of communication, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=880.48s)]
*  including manipulation, deception, repetition, deceit, concealment, distraction, and fear-mongering, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=887.12s)]
*  in language that is intimidating, self-serving, and orchestrated. Now, does that not describe [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=896.4s)]
*  exactly what you just heard, Mr. Producer? It is an approach that seeks to arouse prejudices [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=903.2s)]
*  and stifle independent thought. The purpose is to exert power over language [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=910.8000000000001s)]
*  and to control the population without moral reservations. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=919.36s)]
*  Indeed, morality itself is said to be relative or nothing but an abstraction, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=923.36s)]
*  concealing the rot of open societies and democracies and obfuscating the exploitation of the people. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=927.52s)]
*  In the political context, when language is applied this way, it strikes a central part [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=936.88s)]
*  of the democratic system, denying the body politic information with which to make knowledgeable, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=942.3199999999999s)]
*  qualitative, and collective decisions. And, ladies and gentlemen, this book comes out in four weeks [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=948.16s)]
*  and I think describes to a T, a T, what you're hearing and watching right now. Of course, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=955.04s)]
*  this is the intention of its practitioners. Moreover, communication of this sort exists [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=961.68s)]
*  for the purpose of arousing and angering the citizenry and exhorting them to action that is [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=966.56s)]
*  destructive of the existing society and their own lives and lifestyles in service to the demagogue [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=971.4399999999999s)]
*  and his aim. So we're talking about this guy running in New York, I'm talking about these [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=977.28s)]
*  democrats and what they're saying about this bill and so forth, but I didn't know about the democrat [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=981.4399999999999s)]
*  who was running at the time I wrote this. Inasmuch as the people and their consent are the only [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=988.3199999999999s)]
*  legitimate and just source of government, the entire enterprise becomes corrupt and malevolent. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=993.76s)]
*  Unfortunately, citizens acquiesce to it, regurgitate it, or even demand it, or applicable, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1000.0s)]
*  applicable, vote for it, believing there is no other course, that it is the best course, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1006.32s)]
*  until it's too late to reverse course, without an abrupt and often violent revolt. But for many, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1012.32s)]
*  suffering persists for an extended period of time. Now these two paragraphs [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1018.24s)]
*  describe presciently exactly what's going on in New York, exactly what's going on on Capitol Hill, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1026.3200000000002s)]
*  what's going on in this country right now. And then I provide a little talk context for you. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1031.2s)]
*  For example, prior to the Russian Revolution, Britannica finds that in Vladimir Lenin's [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1038.0s)]
*  1902 pamphlet, that's before the revolution, what is to be done, he argues, and I'm quoting [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1043.76s)]
*  Britannica here, that the propagandist whose primary medium is print, remember this is back then, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1050.56s)]
*  explains the causes of social inequities, such as unemployment or hunger, while the agitator, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1055.9199999999998s)]
*  whose primary medium is speech, seizes on the emotional aspects of those issues to arouse his [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1062.0s)]
*  audience to indignation or action. Agitation is thus the use of political slogans and half-truths [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1067.9199999999998s)]
*  to exploit the grievances of the public, and thereby to mold public opinion and mobilize [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1076.0s)]
*  public support. Propaganda, by contrast, is the reason used of historical and scientific arguments [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1081.68s)]
*  to indoctrinate the educated and so-called enlightened members of society, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1088.8s)]
*  such as party members, such as Democrats. The combination of agitation with propaganda [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1094.16s)]
*  is called agitprop, A-G-I-T-P-R-O-P. The term agitprop was originated and invented [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1102.24s)]
*  by the Soviet Union and its communist central committee secretariat. Now I want to go on with [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1110.64s)]
*  this, we're going to take a break, I hope you'll stick with me, I think it's crucially important [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1117.6000000000001s)]
*  because this is precisely what is taking place. When you watch how I write these books, American [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1121.68s)]
*  Marxism explains the whole Marxist process that's been going on and tailored for the United States [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1128.3200000000002s)]
*  and the West really. Now what I'm digging into here are the entrails of it, what you're seeing, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1133.6799999999998s)]
*  the exercise of power through propaganda, the exercise of power through language. You're hearing [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1140.56s)]
*  it tonight on TV, you're watching it, you've been hearing it with this mayoral candidate, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1146.0s)]
*  so stick with me. I think this is crucial, we'll be right back. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1150.24s)]
*  Are you concerned about the rising number of judges who've been limiting President [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1157.52s)]
*  Trump's executive orders? Now if you're not concerned yet, you should be. When these judges [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1161.36s)]
*  use injunctions to block President Trump's attempts to fulfill his mandate from the American people, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1165.52s)]
*  it is we the people who lose out. Thankfully, the Heritage Foundation has the policy solutions [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1170.4799999999998s)]

*  why it matters, and how under the Constitution they can be stopped. President Trump's agenda [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1188.32s)]
*  is in danger, but even more importantly, the safety of Americans and the future of our nation [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1193.52s)]
*  could be at stake. So please go to heritage.org slash Levin, heritage.org slash L-E-V-I-N, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1198.24s)]

*  This is the nation's town hall meeting and you can join in at 877-381-3811. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1211.76s)]
*  To those of you who are interested, and I know many of you are, I fear you're going to wait to [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1220.8s)]
*  the last minute, but I hope not. At the Reagan Library, 80% of the tickets have sold, so there's [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1225.2s)]
*  20% left and surely in the next 24 or 48 hours and over the weekend and all they'll all be gone. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1232.24s)]
*  So it's like the event of the summer, Sunday, August 17th, the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1238.08s)]
*  we'd love to have you. You go to reaganfoundation.org slash Levin, the entire explanation is there for [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1245.52s)]
*  all you'll be doing and all that's available to you. Reaganfoundation.org slash L-E-V-I-N, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1253.12s)]
*  it's up there on my social sites one more time, reaganfoundation.org slash L-E-V-I-N, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1259.04s)]
*  and it's a book signing, it's dinner, it's... I don't give a speech, we have a conversation, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1263.76s)]
*  we'll go over these things. Some of the things I'm going over with you right now, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1271.92s)]
*  some of the things we'll be discussing and I want to get back to it. So if you're really interested, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1274.8s)]
*  you better jump in because I spoke to the Reagan Library right before I came on the air here [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1279.6000000000001s)]
*  and they said, Mark, you better warn people because what happens is we get stragglers and [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1284.0800000000002s)]
*  other people that they say, okay, I waited, I heard from Mark, okay, I'm just letting you know. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1288.96s)]
*  Let's go on. On power, chapter four, on language, because language is crucial, language is key. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1294.8s)]
*  Again, for Marxism and other forms of autocratic ideologies and governing systems, negative power [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1306.32s)]
*  is exercised through language, and this is what you're hearing now with this guy running in [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1311.92s)]
*  New York and you're hearing from those who are posing this bill right now on the Democrat side, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1316.24s)]
*  at least. That is tailored to lord over the people and control the society and culture. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1321.04s)]
*  Language is a tool of the state that serves the state. It takes on an official character. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1329.4399999999998s)]
*  It is limited, prescribed, restricted. It compels certain types of speech and suppresses other forms. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1335.28s)]
*  Hannah Arendt, a historian and philosopher who escaped the Third Reich, she defined it, simply put [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1341.12s)]
*  it, as thought control of the people, and this is what you're seeing right now. Arendt explained [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1348.8s)]
*  further that what she called totalitarian propaganda involves the use of indirect, veiled, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1354.8799999999999s)]
*  and menacing hints of violence to non-believers. Oh, you're going to be killing people. You're [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1360.8s)]
*  going to be killing people. You're starving children. We're there right now, right? [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1365.92s)]
*  Claims of scientific prophecy is distinguished from old-fashioned appeals to the past [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1372.64s)]
*  and to absolutist systems which suppress men from this history of the human race. It employs [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1377.76s)]
*  absurd predictions, hello, to avoid discussion. Absurd predictions to avoid discussion for only [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1384.8000000000002s)]
*  the future can reveal its merits. Arendt observes that totalitarian propaganda highlights socialism [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1393.84s)]
*  and race as two key categories of exploitation because they neatly lend themselves to group [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1400.9599999999998s)]
*  identification and exploitation, that is, class and ethnic warfare. You hear this from the guy [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1408.24s)]
*  running as the Democrat nominee in New York. You heard it from Pelosi, Jeffries, and others whose [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1416.32s)]
*  clips I played for you half hour ago. It is not a mistake that class and ethnic warfare, among other [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1423.2s)]
*  forms of exploitation, are employed incessantly by American Marxists. Consequently, the goal is to [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1430.48s)]
*  subvert the civil society and the principles, values, and beliefs on which it was established, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1437.04s)]
*  corrupt the public spirit in civic harmony, and reject compromise and accommodation. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1443.2s)]
*  The people must be unmoored from and cleansed of their history, faith, and family. Service to the [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1448.72s)]
*  totalitarian state in its utopian fiction is the highest calling, if not the only calling, and all [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1456.32s)]
*  other forms of experience and socialization are impediments and hindrances to the cause. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1463.52s)]
*  This is me writing. Of course, democracies are not immune to this plight. In fact, they are [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1471.6000000000001s)]
*  susceptible to it. Negative power, and that's what you're seeing, and I describe it at much more [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1476.88s)]
*  length, but I can't read the whole book, albeit to a different degree than in totalitarian regimes, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1482.4s)]
*  in which I earlier referred to it as soft negative power. However, an examination of its influence [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1489.0400000000002s)]
*  in democracies first requires a review, and I'm not going to get into that review because it'll [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1495.0400000000002s)]
*  be too long in the book, but I do want to remind you of this later in the chapter on language. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1501.92s)]
*  An additional area worthy of examination involves truth. By truth, I do not mean in a relative [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1510.88s)]
*  sense, that is, what one might honestly and wrongly believe to be the truth, rather the intentional [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1516.48s)]
*  use of positive language to communicate what is widely known and commonly understood to be truthful [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1521.6000000000001s)]
*  by the person or government using it. In contrast to the intentional use of deceit, slander, and [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1527.84s)]
*  falsehoods in a form or way to suggest, imply, or flat out portray, the statement is true. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1534.1599999999999s)]

*  called Stalin's constitution of 1936. Ready? Article 123, equality of rights of citizens of [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1579.2s)]

*  Article 125, this is the Stalin constitution of 1936. In conformity with the interests of the [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1644.8s)]

*  This is Hakeem Jeffries. This is Nancy Pelosi. You just heard it all. Article 126 of Stalin's 1936 [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1694.24s)]
*  Soviet constitution. In conformity with the interests of the working people and in order [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1702.4s)]

*  protected by law. It goes on. So here you have a crushing genocidal maniac who puts out a [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1761.04s)]
*  constitution like this. It sounds great. Do you know? This not only borrows from our bill of rights, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1767.2s)]
*  but it exceeds them by far. And it provides economic benefits. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1773.44s)]
*  And so I comment. In its civil liberties language, the Stalin constitution is modeled after major [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1783.28s)]
*  parts of our constitution and its bill of rights. But it goes much further, adding language that [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1790.08s)]
*  claims to ensure extensive economic benefits and security as human rights. Yet we all know that [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1796.32s)]
*  Stalin's Soviet Union was one of the most horrific genocidal communist regimes of all. Indeed, it was [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1801.6s)]
*  among the most monstrous autocracies of any ever. That's the language in these articles. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1806.8799999999999s)]
*  And the articles taking together, which promise a free and open society where the government [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1813.12s)]
*  recognizes and protects individual human rights and liberties and provides for the economic and [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1817.12s)]
*  welfare rights of its citizens are loathsome lies. Here, positive language is used as an atrocious [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1822.0s)]
*  deception to advance the gravest form of negative power, mass imprisonments and executions. It has [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1829.6s)]
*  absolutely no connection to the truth. Stalin did not believe a word of it. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1835.4399999999998s)]
*  So why would a diabolical despot establish such a constitution? [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1841.28s)]
*  Language, ladies and gentlemen, sometimes if not often belief in a false idea is enough [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1847.12s)]
*  to make it seem true. Right? At least in the minds of those among the citizenry who want to believe, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1852.32s)]
*  including those who self-identify as patriots of their country and are loyal to it. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1859.9199999999998s)]
*  This is what I call illusory truth. This is an illusory truth. Moreover, the country and [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1864.56s)]
*  government are often seen as one in the same as a whole. To disbelieve in the government is said to [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1870.6399999999999s)]
*  disbelieve in your country. The Stalin's constitution was the motherland's constitution, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1875.52s)]
*  Russia's constitution. Despite being a pack of lies, it is worth noting that the supposed civil [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1880.96s)]
*  liberties in the constitution did not apply to either the police or the Ministry of Interior, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1886.96s)]
*  the monitoring and enforcement arms of the Soviet Union. The language in Stalin's constitution [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1892.32s)]
*  is intended to deceive the people inside and outside the country and perversely justify the [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1899.36s)]
*  regime's domestic terror tactics, which were carried out in the name of the people and the [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1904.96s)]
*  cause. Now, one more time, Mr. Bidusar, I want you to play Zoran Mandami in his campaign video, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1910.16s)]
*  Cut 2, please go. Further toward the Vienna model, we'll have to go beyond the market. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1918.48s)]
*  We can establish community land trusts to gradually buy up housing on the private market [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1924.0s)]
*  and convert it to community ownership. We can give tenants a right of first refusal to buy out [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1928.0s)]
*  their landlords when buildings go up for sale. And we can fully commit to a new era of social [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1932.16s)]
*  housing, ending subsidies for luxury housing development and using our wealth to build beautiful, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1937.0400000000002s)]
*  high quality social housing projects that offer good homes and strong communities to everyone. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1942.3200000000002s)]
*  We won't decommodify housing overnight, but we know what we have to do and we have history to guide [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1947.92s)]
*  He's a liar. He's a soft spoken communist. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1953.6000000000001s)]
*  Then there's Hakeem Jeffries. Once again, the head of the Democrat party in the house. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1961.8400000000001s)]
*  Listen very carefully. Tell me what he sounds like. Cut 8, go. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1965.68s)]
*  And as a result, people are going to die. Connected to this one big ugly bill, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1969.8400000000001s)]
*  10s of thousands of unnecessary American deaths per year. Shame on Republicans for even bringing [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1977.1999999999998s)]
*  this bill to the house floor. It's all we need are for Republicans to join us in support of [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=1986.4799999999998s)]

*  On Power. Cut 10, go. The gentleman just ended by saying to vote for this big beautiful bill. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2018.3200000000002s)]
*  This big beautiful bill. Well, if beauty is in the eye of the beholder, then you, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2025.2s)]
*  GOP, you have a very blurred vision of what America is about. Is it beautiful to cut off [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2030.16s)]
*  food from seniors and children? Is it beautiful to cut off 17 million people from health care? [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2038.72s)]
*  Is it beautiful to do this to give tax cuts to billionaires in our country? Is it beautiful, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2045.3600000000001s)]
*  beautiful to take money from education and the rest? The list goes- [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2052.2400000000002s)]
*  That's enough. You get it. I've got clip after clip after clip. The Democrat Party sounds like [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2056.0s)]
*  a Stalinist party. Their candidates sound more and more that way. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2061.28s)]
*  Do they not? This is the language, the totalitarian language that is used by autocracies. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2071.2s)]
*  They know everything they're saying is a lie, and yet they all say it. They all click their heels. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2081.28s)]
*  They're all in line. And yet when this bill does pass, hopefully tonight, hopefully by tomorrow, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2086.0s)]

*  pass ultimately, many of you are going to have a massive tax increase on average of over $2,000, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2323.92s)]
*  which would be the highest tax increase in American history. This is what the Democrats [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2331.92s)]
*  are hoping for. I have sympathy with some of my friends who are saying it doesn't cut enough. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2335.6s)]
*  The problem is we live in a republic. We have a house of representatives that the people voted for, [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2341.76s)]
*  and they have a three-vote majority. I wish it were 10. I wish it were 50. I wish we had the red [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2348.8799999999997s)]
*  wave everybody kept talking about. But we do have a majority in the House and majority in the Senate. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2354.7999999999997s)]
*  And so at least we can get what we can get. At least we can get what we can get. None of the [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2361.3599999999997s)]
*  people who are objecting to this have a way out of it. None of them. None of them. That's why Rand [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2367.2s)]
*  Paul and Tom Massey, they make good points, but they're irrelevant. They're irrelevant. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2374.08s)]
*  We live in a republic. There are other representatives, and they don't agree with them. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2382.64s)]
*  So what do you want to do? There's a lot of good things in this bill, too, many. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2387.12s)]
*  The Trump bill needs to pass. They wouldn't have a majority in the Senate. They wouldn't have a [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2394.96s)]
*  majority in the House but for him. And let's be blunt about it. I remember, again, in October 1981, [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2398.3199999999997s)]
*  when we had one of the greatest tax cuts in American history under Ronald Reagan. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2403.76s)]
*  Enormous economic growth. And people were poo-pooing that bill, too. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2407.84s)]
*  Now Donald Trump put out a true social tweet tonight. Check that this morning. And he said, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2414.96s)]
*  nobody's talking about growth. What he's saying is the tax cuts will create enormous amount of [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2421.6800000000003s)]
*  growth on top of his other economic policies. We're re-industrializing America. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2427.04s)]
*  That's what his tariffs are intended to do, to re-industrialize America [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2434.96s)]
*  in the face of the communist Chinese and the rest. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2438.56s)]
*  And he wants a massive tax cut across the board that has nothing to do with billionaires or [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2443.2799999999997s)]
*  millionaires, with people who are average income earners or less. He's trying to protect people [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2448.32s)]
*  who get tips. He's trying to protect people who work overtime. He's trying to protect senior [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2456.8s)]
*  citizens. He's trying to protect people who provide assistance to a loved one who is ill. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2461.1200000000003s)]
*  There's all kinds of great things in here. Does it go as far as we want? No, of course not, [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2469.2000000000003s)]
*  because we only have three majority in the House. And when you look at the Senate, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2474.48s)]
*  when you look that you needed JD Vance, the vice president, president of the Senate, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2479.84s)]
*  to break a tie vote, you can see what's going on here. In other words, every primadonna can blackmail [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2484.16s)]
*  the whole group. Now we've all been in meetings like this, where we look at the guys and look at [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2490.24s)]
*  that a-hole over there. Right? Haven't you, Mr. Medusa? We always have one or two. Okay, great. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2495.2s)]
*  But they have no fix. They have no resolution. That's the problem. Now, if more would get elected, [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2503.68s)]
*  we'd have some room to operate, but we have none. And under those circumstances, [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2512.96s)]
*  this is pretty damn good. So we have an official of Vint Cerge. Here's the number. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2519.04s)]
*  You'll get the Capitol Hill board. They'll ask you for the name of your senator or house member. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2524.16s)]
*  Have the name of your house member ready. It'll go to the house member. And I'm told now everything's [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2530.0s)]
*  going to voicemail because we've clogged up the lines. That's okay in voicemail. Be polite, [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2534.48s)]

*  monster murdered these four beautiful young people [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2658.96s)]

*  And I don't know what's wrong with people. I really don't. I don't know what's wrong with [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2740.32s)]

*  this? Why is it so hard? Was there a screw-up? Who are the screw-ups? I'm so sick of these screw-ups. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2766.24s)]
*  And he confessed today because he wants to live. Isn't that amazing? He wants to do what he didn't [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=2775.04s)]

*  what we're dealing with here so i feel like many of them should get out on during the election [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5295.839999999999s)]
*  cycle and help us elect more conservatives some of them you know they keep pulling in money for [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5301.28s)]
*  themselves they're in relatively safe districts they call my shauncey please can i come on i have [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5305.76s)]
*  a better idea let's get some more of our guys elected so we can make more cuts right well well [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5310.08s)]
*  well said well said here's the other thing i think is important for us all to remember and you [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5316.24s)]
*  understand this momentum is important it's important in sports it's important in politics [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5320.16s)]
*  and right now president trump is it's a wave of momentum we've seen the numbers his approval [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5326.56s)]
*  numbers amongst republicans and and base voters and and all kinds of americans are off the charts [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5332.64s)]
*  we just had the successful operation in iran he just went to nato got those countries to [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5338.08s)]
*  ante up more for the defense of our country and their countries and and of course we have a secure [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5343.280000000001s)]
*  border that he's done in the first seven months of his presidency and now we're going to stop a bill [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5348.320000000001s)]
*  that cuts taxes for american families are you kidding me so i think we need to remember that [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5354.400000000001s)]
*  as well it just it makes so much sense just to pass this thing now we've got to we got some other [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5361.44s)]
*  things we got to deal with i get that we'll get with them down the road but let's get this thing [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5367.36s)]
*  passed and let the president sign her on the fourth of july for goodness sake that'd be great [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5371.12s)]
*  and this really is a pro growth bill that's the focus and now like you put out this morning [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5376.0s)]
*  and that was very reagan-esque too you say look we need to slash these taxes we're going to [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5382.16s)]
*  re-industrialize america we need to have a massive economic you know expansion in these tax cuts [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5387.04s)]
*  most of which go to the middle class and these tax cuts are what are going to look kennedy did it [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5395.36s)]
*  and reagan did it yeah and trump did it before they always work to grow the economy don't they [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5402.8s)]
*  yeah whenever you let regular people keep their money and not give it to the bureaucracy here in [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5409.44s)]
*  dc not give it to the government agency whenever you give it to the people it's better spent it's [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5415.52s)]
*  good for them their future their goals their dreams their kids and our economy in our country [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5422.160000000001s)]
*  that is just fundamental republican principle but it's the truth so again i can't believe we're [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5429.4400000000005s)]
*  we're right and i don't think we're going so i think it's going to pass sometime today maybe [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5436.56s)]
*  late tonight still but i think it is going to pass and it should pass because it's good for the [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5439.76s)]
*  country let me remind my listeners this is a levin search 202-224-312 and that's the capitol [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5444.4s)]
*  line they're going to ask you for the name of your senator congressman tell them the name of [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5451.839999999999s)]
*  your congressman leave a very polite voicemail if there's any room left on the voicemail [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5455.04s)]
*  and tell them to vote for the trump bill that's what you want to time i want to overwhelm these [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5461.12s)]
*  lines i want to really push in because every now and then we got to get involved at the [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5465.12s)]
*  grassroots that's what we do on the show and make something happen and that's us it's our country [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5469.68s)]
*  we got to make it happen now you make a great point wouldn't it be strange indeed if it's the [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5475.4400000000005s)]
*  republicans who blunt trump's massive progress in the first six months that's insane is it not [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5481.12s)]
*  i mean yeah i mean sometimes i think we have to be careful that we don't miss the force for the [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5490.16s)]
*  trees here and understand that the big picture since look at the momentum that we are generating [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5495.04s)]
*  as a party that president trump under his leadership is generating for our party for our country [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5500.16s)]
*  i don't think we want to stymie that in any way um so like i said let's get this passed we can we [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5507.04s)]
*  can move on to some other things we got to deal with i get all that but this this makes so much [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5512.16s)]
*  sense to me because it again democrats hate it they hate this bill and that should tell us a lot [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5516.72s)]
*  not one single democrat is supporting it conservatives in the senate conservatives [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5523.92s)]
*  in the house conservatives like mark levin are supporting it that's why it makes sense i think [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5528.4s)]
*  as well to pass this thing jim jordan i heard it from god himself hakim jeffries who said [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5532.72s)]
*  thousands of people tens of thousands are going to lose their lives if this bill is passed let us [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5541.04s)]
*  engage on that point after the bottom of the hour we'll be right back with the great jim jordan [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5546.88s)]
*  mark levin the thunder on the right calling now eight seven seven three eight one three eight one [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5555.68s)]

*  jim you've been in congress how long now 18 years is it getting dumber in there or what the [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5569.76s)]
*  rhetoric that these people use now on the left it's like it's like thousands of people are going [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5579.2s)]
*  to die and i'm going what the hell are these fools talking about what the hell are these fools [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5585.2s)]
*  talking about i don't even know yeah it's just yeah it's not even true uh somehow you know you're [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5589.4400000000005s)]
*  you're making people work who are getting public assistance a work requirement for able-bodied [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5596.0s)]
*  men able-bodied adults somehow that's kicking people off and taking health care from it makes [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5600.88s)]
*  makes no sense but i always say not all democrats are crazy but the left that controls their party [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5605.76s)]
*  is and you can go issue by it is crazy to defund the police it is crazy not to have a border it is [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5610.96s)]
*  crazy let men compete against women in sports it's crazy to blame president trump for the riots in [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5616.88s)]
*  la because he sent troops out there to stop the riots in la you can just keep it's crazy let a [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5621.28s)]
*  chinese spy balloon fly clear across the country and then shoot it down i think i think mark levin [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5626.0s)]
*  would have probably shot it down before it went across the country i know trump i know i would [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyyvfEACxHU&t=5631.679999999999s)]
