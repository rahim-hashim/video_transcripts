Video Description: This week on the Mark Levin Show, there is this Marxist-Islamist movement infiltrating U.S. institutions, especially the Democratic Party. ‘On Power’ is a unique educational tool on these threats and it explores the ideological threats of Marxism and Islamism to American liberty, rights, sovereignty, and faith. It delves into the historical, philosophical, and political contexts of these issues, contrasting the Judeo-Christian belief system with Marxist-Islamist ideologies.  It’s time for a Levin surge to tell your member of Congress to vote yes for the big, beautiful bill. Yes, there are certain issues that matter to us all that are not addressed as we would wish, but there are many very important provisions in this bill that must be enacted from tax cuts and more resources for detaining and deporting criminal illegal aliens! There is a miniscule majority in the House. If there was a larger majority the outcome might be different, but IF is not reality.  The economy is strong with robust job growth, low unemployment, minimal inflation, and declining prices for gas, food, and housing. The big, beautiful bill, now passed, has significant tax cuts and include more border security with increased ICE funding. There’s a lot more to do but we should take a victory lap.

# The Best Of Mark Levin - 7/5/25
**The Mark Levin Show:** [July 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA)
*  It's all quiet in the underground bunker. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=0.0s)]
*  Doors closed, locks bolted. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=4.0s)]
*  But the Great One isn't just resting on his laurels. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=7.5s)]
*  He's making sure your weekend is even better by giving you his best. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=11.0s)]
*  This is the Best of Mark Levin. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=16.0s)]
*  I was the keynote speaker, although there were great speakers. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=20.5s)]
*  Just tremendous. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=26.0s)]
*  At the Christianage United for Israel event. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=27.5s)]
*  And Kufi represents almost 11 million active Christians in support of the United States, the State of Israel, and the Bible. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=30.5s)]
*  And it was founded by Pastor John Hegge, the Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=42.5s)]
*  His beautiful wife and daughter and son. Just a beautiful family. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=49.5s)]
*  My family and his family become extraordinarily close. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=53.5s)]
*  Such a great honor. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=57.5s)]
*  And we met so many fantastic people there. Perhaps many of you. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=61.5s)]
*  Just fantastic, God-loving people. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=67.5s)]
*  You know, we say God-fearing, I say God-loving people. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=70.5s)]
*  And when you think about the debate, the lead up to what Israel did with Iran and then what we did... [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=75.5s)]
*  ...to their nuclear sites, you realize that... [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=81.5s)]
*  ...this debate occurs mostly in Washington. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=86.5s)]
*  That the overwhelming majority of the American people... [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=90.5s)]
*  ...wanted the Israelis to defeat the Iranians and wanted the United States military to take out their nuclear sites. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=95.5s)]
*  And that's what the polling shows. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=101.5s)]
*  And I sat here and I thought about this. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=106.5s)]
*  Look what's happened in the Middle East. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=110.5s)]
*  Thanks to Benjamin Netanyahu having to deal with Biden and now Benjamin Netanyahu teaming up with our great president, Donald Trump. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=114.5s)]
*  What the two of them have done. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=122.5s)]
*  It's radically changed the Middle East for the better and more changes to come. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=124.5s)]
*  Keep this in mind next time there's a debate among so-called influencers and isolationists. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=132.5s)]
*  And we red-blooded American yanks. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=137.5s)]
*  All this hate America stuff coming from the isolationists, the paleo-cons, that's what they used to be called, the Buchananites. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=142.5s)]
*  And the Marxist Islamists on the left. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=151.5s)]
*  And look what this president has achieved. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=156.5s)]
*  There's reason to be optimistic, very. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=158.5s)]
*  The border is secure. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=162.5s)]
*  They're trying to find and remove the criminals and these are horrendous people sent into this country who've come into this country. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=164.5s)]
*  During the Democrat-Biden regime open border and they came by the millions, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=176.5s)]
*  People came here by the millions. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=181.5s)]
*  It's shocking. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=187.5s)]
*  And this president trying to deal with it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=188.5s)]
*  Look at the Supreme Court rule when it comes to these lower courts. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=191.5s)]
*  You ruled what we wanted them to rule. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=194.5s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=196.5s)]
*  I'm not a Patsy. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=197.5s)]
*  I'm not a Pollyanna, but I'm just saying let's look at the victories. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=198.5s)]
*  It just told the lower courts you can't do what you're doing. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=202.5s)]
*  Now will they look for ways around it? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=206.5s)]
*  Yes, they certainly will. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=208.5s)]
*  But at least in the first round, which is a big round, we won. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=210.5s)]
*  Look at the other ruling written by Alito, 6 to 3, about parents and children. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=216.5s)]
*  And school boards and school systems. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=226.5s)]
*  A massive victory. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=228.5s)]
*  And the president is trying to get the people to do what he wants. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=231.5s)]
*  And school boards and school systems. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=234.5s)]
*  A massive victory. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=237.5s)]
*  And if the president is able and the Republican leadership is able to get this bill through, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=241.5s)]
*  whether it takes a little longer or not, you can have a massive tax cut. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=246.5s)]
*  Not everybody, but 70% of the American people. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=250.5s)]
*  A massive tax cut. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=253.5s)]
*  And for those of you who don't get much of a tax cut, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=255.5s)]
*  at least you'll be able to hold on to most of the tax cut you had in the prior Trump term. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=258.5s)]
*  Now you might talk spending. I don't disagree. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=265.5s)]
*  But what's the alternative here? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=268.5s)]
*  The Democrat party wants massive tax increases and even more spending. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=270.5s)]
*  And I would say to my conservative brothers and sisters, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=276.5s)]
*  I want bigger tax, excuse me, spending cuts too. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=279.5s)]
*  But you can't do it when you have a three vote majority in both houses of Congress [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=282.5s)]
*  because you have the Susan Collins types. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=287.5s)]
*  Or you have the Rhino types. You have liberal Republicans or whatever you have. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=291.5s)]
*  So it's impossible to accomplish what we want to accomplish. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=296.5s)]
*  There are more reports about how Israelis are killing Palestinians. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=305.5s)]
*  It's amazing to me. You've got hostages there in Gaza. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=308.5s)]
*  They still won't allow... They could have peace in two minutes. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=312.5s)]
*  Surrender, give the hostages back and it's all over. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=315.5s)]
*  But they won't do it. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=318.5s)]
*  They won't do it. That's the bottom line. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=319.5s)]
*  Now, things aren't perfect and we need to fight. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=323.5s)]
*  We need to be resolute. There's a lot to do. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=326.5s)]
*  There's a movement in this country, Marxist Islamist movement, that has taken hold. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=330.5s)]
*  That is in our culture. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=334.5s)]
*  It's in academia. It's destroying our colleges, even our best colleges. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=336.5s)]
*  It's destroying our entertainment. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=341.5s)]
*  It's destroying our news media. It's destroyed the Democrat party. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=343.5s)]
*  It's leeching into the Republican party through isolationists. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=346.5s)]
*  And it's a real deal. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=351.5s)]
*  And all you have to do is look at France and especially England now and then you'll see. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=354.5s)]
*  This has been in the works for about 40 to 50 years. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=359.5s)]
*  CARE was founded in 1993. It's a Hamas front group. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=362.5s)]
*  It was founded for the purpose of leading the cause. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=366.5s)]
*  To try mainstream radical jihadi Islamism. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=368.5s)]
*  And the Marxists long ago took over our faculty in the 1960s. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=378.5s)]
*  And you have the fusion of what I've talked about repeatedly of the Marxists and the Islamists. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=385.5s)]
*  They are here. They are dangerous. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=389.5s)]
*  They have basically conquered the Democrat party. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=391.5s)]
*  That's what they've done. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=394.5s)]
*  They have basically conquered the Democrat party. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=395.5s)]
*  That's what they've done. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=397.5s)]
*  They have basically conquered the Democrat party. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=399.5s)]
*  How did this happen? It's in my book, On Power. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=402.5s)]
*  Where are we going with this? It's in my book, On Power. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=405.5s)]
*  Why do they hate us? Why do they want to destroy us? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=410.5s)]
*  It's in my book, On Power. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=412.5s)]
*  What about the Democrat party? It's in my book, On Power. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=416.5s)]
*  I delve into faith. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=422.5s)]
*  Faith belief. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=425.5s)]
*  The Judeo-Christian belief system. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=427.5s)]
*  Versus the Marxist-Islamist belief system. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=429.5s)]
*  And they have a lot in common, those two. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=432.5s)]
*  Not ultimately, but a lot in terms of the means, not so much the ends. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=434.5s)]
*  And you're going to read about it. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=440.5s)]
*  It's something I think that you'll find compelling. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=443.5s)]
*  And really motivating to deal with. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=447.5s)]
*  And that's the point of this book. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=450.5s)]
*  You're going to look at a way, and find a way, to look at freedom [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=453.5s)]
*  and unalienable rights like you've never looked at it before. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=457.5s)]
*  Ever. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=461.5s)]
*  Because in my eleventh book, it's what it is. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=465.5s)]
*  Ten, excluding rescuing Sprite on these substantive issues. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=468.5s)]
*  Having taken time to do research for half a century. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=477.5s)]
*  To study these issues for half a century. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=480.5s)]
*  I think I've come upon something that's very important. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=484.5s)]
*  People talk about power and passing, and then they move on. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=489.5s)]
*  We talk about liberty till we're blown in the face. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=493.5s)]
*  We talk about tyranny till we're blown in the face. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=495.5s)]
*  And we should. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=497.5s)]
*  But we have to explain why liberty. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=498.5s)]
*  Why tyranny. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=500.5s)]
*  Why not Islamism? Why not Marxism? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=502.5s)]
*  Why yes, Republicanism? Why yes, Constitutionalism? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=505.5s)]
*  And I lay it out. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=508.5s)]
*  And every time I look, I have this Marxist, Islamist, anti-Semite [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=510.5s)]
*  and Tafata supporter, that's terrorism. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=518.5s)]
*  Who's the Democrat nomination for mayor of New York? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=523.5s)]
*  You never thought it would happen. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=525.5s)]
*  Worse is going to happen. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=527.5s)]
*  If we don't educate ourselves about this, the education in this book [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=530.5s)]
*  is not available anywhere else. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=533.5s)]
*  You're not going to get it in college. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=535.5s)]
*  You're not going to get it in high school. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=536.5s)]
*  You're not going to get it in the media. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=537.5s)]
*  It's not available anywhere else. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=539.5s)]
*  Well, you'll get it in the media to the extent I talk about it. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=541.5s)]
*  Then you'll get it. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=543.5s)]
*  Very important. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=544.5s)]
*  And why is it the isolationists are so wrong? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=550.5s)]
*  I don't even mention them in the book. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=552.5s)]
*  But why is it that they're so wrong? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=554.5s)]
*  Because they don't accept the mindset of the enemy. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=556.5s)]
*  They don't even treat it as an enemy. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=560.5s)]
*  They think we're the enemy. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=562.5s)]
*  Or the Jews are the enemy. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=564.5s)]
*  Or Israel's the enemy. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=565.5s)]
*  Or the warmonger's the enemy. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=566.5s)]
*  This is a problem. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=568.5s)]
*  This is a problem we've got to deal with. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=569.5s)]
*  It's a matter of understanding, informing ourselves on what we're dealing with. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=573.5s)]
*  I divide this book into different chapters. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=583.5s)]
*  There are not a lot of chapters. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=588.5s)]
*  Into different chapters. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=589.5s)]
*  There are not a lot of chapters. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=590.5s)]
*  There are not a lot of chapters. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=595.5s)]
*  But each one is very important. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=599.5s)]
*  The first chapter is on power. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=601.5s)]
*  What do I mean by this? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=603.5s)]
*  Think about power. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=605.5s)]
*  It's ubiquitous. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=606.5s)]
*  So what do I mean by it? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=607.5s)]
*  And how am I going to fashion a discussion about it? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=608.5s)]
*  Chapter two is on negative power. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=612.5s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=614.5s)]
*  People think they know what it means, but people really don't know what that means. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=615.5s)]
*  So I broke out that piece and I explained that. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=618.5s)]
*  Next chapter, obviously, positive power. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=620.5s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=622.5s)]
*  Why is it positive? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=626.5s)]
*  Chapter four is on language. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=630.5s)]
*  I address on language in other books, but this time I address it in another way. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=631.5s)]
*  In relation to power. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=637.5s)]
*  And wokeism. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=639.5s)]
*  And speech rules on college campuses and on and on and on. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=640.5s)]
*  On rights. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=647.5s)]
*  What does power have to do with rights? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=650.5s)]
*  We have rights right there in the Declaration of Independence. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=651.5s)]
*  Unalienable rights. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=653.5s)]
*  Well, there's a difference between God giving unalienable rights and how those unalienable [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=655.5s)]
*  rights given to us by God are matched with the rights of the people of the world. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=660.5s)]
*  And how those unalienable rights given to us by God are manifested right here on Earth. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=665.5s)]
*  The earthly application of those unalienable rights. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=671.5s)]
*  So we're going to discuss that in the book. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=674.5s)]
*  Chapter five and much more. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=676.5s)]
*  What do we mean by liberty? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=679.5s)]
*  Well, ladies and gentlemen, I went to the greatest sources of that word. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=681.5s)]
*  I went to Aristotle and Cicero. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=684.5s)]
*  I want to John Stuart Mill wrote a whole book called on liberty. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=688.5s)]
*  I wrote to the founders. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=691.5s)]
*  I went to the founders of your country. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=692.5s)]
*  And many more. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=695.5s)]
*  You know what I found, Mr. Producer? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=698.5s)]
*  There's no great definition for liberty. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=702.5s)]
*  It's typically described by what it's not. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=706.5s)]
*  When the context is something else. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=709.5s)]
*  And so we get into this. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=713.5s)]
*  What really does liberty mean? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=716.5s)]
*  What really does liberty mean? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=718.5s)]
*  This book could have been a thousand pages long. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=723.5s)]
*  It could be ten books. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=725.5s)]
*  If I decided to apply power to immigration. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=727.5s)]
*  Power to equality. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=730.5s)]
*  Power to you name it. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=731.5s)]
*  That's not the nature of this book. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=734.5s)]
*  And if I wrote a book a thousand pages long, you wouldn't read it. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=735.5s)]
*  Neither would I. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=738.5s)]
*  Be a good good doorstop, probably. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=739.5s)]
*  Or one of those cocktail table books and nobody reads it just sits there. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=742.5s)]
*  I want you to read it. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=745.5s)]
*  That's why when you read this book, you'll find there's a. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=748.5s)]
*  A limit on the number of endnotes, because most of it's my own thinking. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=752.5s)]
*  There's endnotes. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=755.5s)]
*  I give credit where credit's due. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=756.5s)]
*  You will find. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=757.5s)]
*  That the book, the substance of the book. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=760.5s)]
*  Is one hundred and eighty two pages long, not three hundred pages long. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=765.5s)]
*  You will find in each page in each chapter. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=768.5s)]
*  Something that is intriguing and compelling. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=770.5s)]
*  You may have to go back and read it twice, maybe three times. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=772.5s)]
*  The thing through the think through the points that I'm raising with you. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=777.5s)]
*  And you're going to find that this book has everything to do with what. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=784.5s)]
*  You discuss at the breakfast table, that the dinner table at Thanksgiving. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=787.5s)]
*  This book has everything to do with the debates that go on. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=791.5s)]
*  You're going to find that. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=794.5s)]
*  Breakfast table at the dinner table at Thanksgiving. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=795.5s)]
*  This book has everything to do with the debates that go on in this country. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=797.5s)]
*  This book has everything to do with 80 percent of what you see on TV. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=800.5s)]
*  Or listen to on radio. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=804.5s)]
*  And it's going to change the way you view things for the better. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=807.5s)]
*  For the better. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=812.5s)]

*  They are the first that I have spoken to. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=876.5s)]

*  people, you know, the system has told me, these strong elected people, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=882.5s)]
*  right? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=888.5s)]

*  Excuse me. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=896.5s)]
*  I'm gonna [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=898.5s)]
*  to remember what it is that we are fighting for. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=900.78s)]
*  And to remember that our agenda is an agenda [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=903.66s)]
*  that must not be dictated by calculus, but by conviction. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=906.18s)]
*  And what I mean by that is that the many things [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=910.06s)]
*  that we believe, some of them are already popular [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=912.26s)]
*  in this moment right now. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=915.48s)]
*  If we're talking about the cancellation of student debt, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=916.98s)]
*  if we're talking about Medicare for all, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=919.02s)]

*  of popular support across this country. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=924.22s)]
*  But then there are also other issues [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=926.62s)]
*  that we firmly believe in, whether it's BDS, right? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=928.06s)]

*  protecting what is yours. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=963.3s)]
*  Again, this book on power gets into this in a big way. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=966.5s)]
*  He just said seize the means of production. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=970.4599999999999s)]
*  He's a Stalinist. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=976.18s)]
*  He didn't simply say, which would be bad enough, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=979.5s)]
*  share the wealth, did he? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=981.54s)]
*  Redistribute wealth. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=982.9799999999999s)]
*  He said seize the means of production. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=983.8199999999999s)]
*  Now, are we supposed to forget this? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=988.74s)]
*  Because he smiles? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=991.06s)]
*  He's also from a fairly wealthy family. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=993.02s)]
*  He wants you to believe he grew up in the Third World. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=994.8199999999999s)]
*  No, he was born in the Third World, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=996.62s)]
*  and they came to the United States. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=998.02s)]
*  Then, of course, he wants to destroy the United States. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=999.9399999999999s)]
*  He's of Indian heritage. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1004.02s)]
*  And he's also a racist pig [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1007.6999999999999s)]
*  because he talks about taxing white people more. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1009.78s)]
*  He's also an anti-Semitic pig [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1013.74s)]
*  because of the things he says about Judaism and Israel. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1016.5799999999999s)]
*  This is who he is. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1026.8999999999999s)]
*  Go ahead, Mr. Producer. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1028.82s)]
*  At this very moment. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1031.18s)]
*  And what I want to say is that it is critical [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1033.02s)]
*  that in the way that we organize, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1035.6599999999999s)]
*  in the way that we set up our work and our priorities, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1037.54s)]
*  that we do not leave any one issue for the other, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1042.78s)]
*  that we do not meet a moment [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1046.38s)]
*  and only look at what people are ready for, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1049.22s)]
*  but that we are doing both of these things in tandem. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1051.46s)]
*  In other words, impose your will on the people. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1053.94s)]
*  Dress it up, camouflage it, make it sound cool. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1056.14s)]
*  Freebies for everybody. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1059.66s)]
*  Who could be against that? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1060.8200000000002s)]
*  Don't accept the status quo. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1064.0600000000002s)]
*  Destroy it and proceed. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1067.02s)]
*  One of the things that's never discussed in this, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1071.38s)]
*  in the book is what do you surrender in exchange for this? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1073.58s)]
*  And his opponents are probably not smart enough to raise it. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1080.02s)]
*  Maybe Curtis is, but I can't think of anyone else. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1082.94s)]
*  What do you lose when somebody says, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1087.22s)]
*  seize the means of production, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1090.3799999999999s)]
*  when somebody says, basically, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1092.42s)]
*  we're going to take over the grocery industry, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1094.6599999999999s)]
*  when somebody says free Medicare for everybody, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1096.58s)]
*  in his case, it won't be Medicare, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1100.22s)]
*  but it could be aspects of healthcare. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1101.58s)]
*  What do you lose? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1104.3799999999999s)]
*  You lose your liberty. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1105.22s)]
*  That's what you lose. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1106.22s)]
*  You lose freedom. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1108.3799999999999s)]
*  Because he can't do this through a democratic process. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1110.58s)]
*  Oh, he'll get elected maybe, but that's not my point. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1115.98s)]
*  You won't, once they're in, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1119.1399999999999s)]
*  they're not going to seek your input. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1120.82s)]
*  They're going to impose their will. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1123.02s)]
*  There is no way to seek your input and have it matter, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1124.4199999999998s)]
*  if you're talking about seizing the means of production. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1127.6999999999998s)]
*  So if you have a business in New York, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1130.3s)]
*  any kind of business, small, medium, large, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1132.3799999999999s)]
*  food, jewelry, doesn't matter. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1134.74s)]
*  Seize the means of production. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1137.58s)]
*  And of course, it's obvious. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1141.34s)]
*  What government can run anything, seriously? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1144.3s)]
*  That's a practical point, but here's a real point. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1147.74s)]
*  Any government that can seize the means of production [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1150.98s)]
*  can steal your liberty, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1155.54s)]
*  can steal your mobility. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1158.54s)]
*  Will make decisions about your life [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1161.3s)]
*  in the name of the people, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1163.6599999999999s)]
*  even though the people aren't consulted. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1165.34s)]
*  This guy is a hardcore Stalinist. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1168.86s)]
*  He's a Stalinist. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1172.46s)]
*  Oh, does that mean he's going to lock everybody up? [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1174.26s)]
*  No, but that doesn't mean he's not a Stalinist. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1177.1399999999999s)]
*  He has a Stalinist mentality. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1180.54s)]
*  That's what he is. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1182.98s)]
*  Mark Levin. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1183.82s)]
*  Making your weekend even better. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1190.3s)]
*  This is the best of Mark Levin. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1197.4199999999998s)]
*  It's time for a rare, but necessary Levin surge, America. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1200.6599999999999s)]
*  All you patriots out there, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1204.62s)]
*  please call your member of the house [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1208.18s)]
*  through the Capitol Hill switchboard, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1210.26s)]
*  202-224-3121. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1211.98s)]
*  I'm posting it on my social sites, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1215.02s)]
*  202-224-3121. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1217.34s)]
*  Yes, there are certain issues that matter to us all [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1221.14s)]
*  that are not addressed as we would wish in this bill. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1223.26s)]
*  But there are many, many very important provisions [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1226.26s)]
*  in this bill that must be enacted. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1228.46s)]
*  And if we don't get the bill enacted, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1230.8600000000001s)]
*  there's going to be a massive tax increase. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1233.34s)]
*  There won't be enough ice to protect us on the border. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1235.18s)]
*  There are Medicaid issues. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1239.94s)]
*  We don't want illegal aliens getting Medicaid, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1241.14s)]
*  and we don't want able-bodied men and women [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1243.22s)]
*  who refuse to put in 20 hours a week getting Medicaid either. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1246.46s)]
*  We don't want the same amount of money [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1249.54s)]
*  that Medicaid was ever for. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1251.02s)]
*  We have a minuscule majority in the House of Representatives. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1254.26s)]
*  Like it or not, it matters. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1257.1s)]
*  If we had 30, 40, 50 more conservatives in the House [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1261.02s)]
*  and maybe 10 more conservatives in the Senate, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1264.1s)]
*  you and I could impose our will. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1266.9s)]
*  But as it is now, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1268.78s)]
*  Donald Trump has done everything humanly possible [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1271.1s)]
*  to get the very best bill he can. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1274.1s)]
*  We can sit here and twirl our thumbs and whine about it. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1275.98s)]
*  You've got individuals who want to beat their chests. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1279.3000000000002s)]
*  That's all well and good. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1282.3400000000001s)]
*  But this is where we are. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1284.66s)]
*  This is what we have. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1286.18s)]
*  There's a reason why the Democrats are jumping up and down [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1289.6200000000001s)]
*  in opposition to this bill. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1292.3000000000002s)]
*  So I want to strongly encourage you, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1296.6200000000001s)]
*  my fellow patriots, Levinites, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1298.98s)]
*  this is one of those rare occasions [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1302.9s)]
*  when we use the Levin surge, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1304.74s)]
*  as we have in the past decades, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1307.3s)]
*  to block legislation and to support tax cuts. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1310.78s)]
*  There are tax cuts in this bill [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1316.34s)]
*  that should positively affect [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1319.14s)]
*  the vast majority of you in my audience. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1320.9s)]
*  The vast majority. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1325.46s)]
*  So it is time for Levin surge. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1329.46s)]
*  It is time for patriots to come together [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1331.3s)]
*  to make your voice heard, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1334.5s)]
*  to flood the Capitol Hill switchboard. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1336.5s)]
*  Starting right now, 202-224-3121. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1339.14s)]
*  That number will be on all my social sites. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1343.1s)]
*  202-224-3121. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1349.06s)]
*  I remember when I served in the Reagan administration [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1352.98s)]
*  for eight years, no bill was good enough. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1355.14s)]
*  A massive tax cut. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1357.9s)]
*  I remember it in August of 1981. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1360.46s)]
*  And you had people saying, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1367.14s)]
*  well, there'll be massive deficits [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1368.66s)]
*  and the cuts don't go far enough. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1370.46s)]
*  The greatest tax cuts in American history. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1372.26s)]
*  These will now be the greatest tax cuts [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1374.94s)]
*  in American history. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1377.06s)]
*  And the truth is, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1378.9s)]
*  it created extraordinary growth in our economy. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1380.3s)]

*  Business creation and entrepreneurs. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1385.86s)]
*  It exploded with growth. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1387.98s)]

*  And now having learned from what the Democrats [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1396.1s)]
*  and the rhinos did with the Reagan tax cuts, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1399.1s)]
*  kept spending and spending and spending. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1401.78s)]
*  You have a president, Trump, who has seen that, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1404.34s)]
*  who knows about it. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1406.5s)]
*  We all do. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1407.5s)]

*  We learn from history. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1411.02s)]
*  It's called knowledge. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1412.1s)]

*  America. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1419.58s)]

*  Is the bill perfect? [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1434.78s)]

*  Are these members of Congress perfect? [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1437.5s)]
*  No, I can't stand most of them. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1439.1s)]
*  But that's beside the point. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1440.6599999999999s)]

*  He's had the greatest six months of any president. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1506.46s)]
*  And then the Republicans in the Congress thwart him. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1509.02s)]
*  We can't have that. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1513.3s)]
*  202-224-3121. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1515.9s)]

*  I'm imploring you, we need your help. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1527.18s)]
*  Just like an election night. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1529.66s)]
*  Just like an election night, I implored you. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1531.82s)]
*  Get to the polls, get out of your cars, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1533.94s)]

*  Positive for your own family, positive for the country. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1543.78s)]
*  Now, I wanna play you some clips of the enemy, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1549.06s)]
*  AKA the Democrats. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1554.02s)]
*  I wanna play you some clips, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1557.38s)]
*  and then I wanna address this [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1559.1s)]
*  in a very thorough Levin-like way. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1560.18s)]
*  It's very important. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1563.06s)]
*  First, we go to Zaran Mamdani, the Marxist Islamist, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1565.0600000000002s)]

*  Let us not forget. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1575.66s)]
*  Let's go, cut to in a campaign video, go. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1580.14s)]
*  Go further toward the Vienna model. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1583.18s)]
*  We'll have to go beyond the market. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1585.5s)]
*  We can establish community land trusts [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1587.38s)]
*  to gradually buy up housing on the private market [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1589.0200000000002s)]
*  and convert it to community ownership. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1591.3000000000002s)]
*  We can give tenants a right of first refusal [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1593.26s)]
*  to buy out their landlords when buildings go up for sale. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1595.06s)]
*  And we can fully commit to a new era of social housing, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1597.74s)]
*  ending subsidies for luxury housing development [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1601.18s)]
*  and using our wealth to build beautiful, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1603.3799999999999s)]
*  high-quality social housing projects [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1605.54s)]
*  that offer good homes and strong communities to everyone. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1607.58s)]
*  We won't decommodify housing overnight, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1611.18s)]
*  but we know what we have to do, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1613.62s)]
*  and we have history to guide us. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1615.1s)]
*  All right, cut to seven. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1618.1s)]
*  This is Maxwell Frost, Democrat, Florida, go. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1619.1s)]
*  That clip you posted earlier when he was asked [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1623.3799999999999s)]
*  about the health care system, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1625.22s)]
*  even the way he answered the question was the first he said. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1626.34s)]
*  One Vance was asked about the health care system, go ahead. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1630.54s)]
*  That clip you posted earlier when he was asked [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1633.98s)]

*  even the way he answered the question [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1636.98s)]
*  was the first thing he said. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1638.3s)]
*  He brought up the business of rural healthcare. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1639.42s)]
*  He didn't bring up making sure [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1642.58s)]
*  humans in rural America are healthy, the business. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1644.06s)]
*  And that's the thing, is it's all a business, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1647.1s)]
*  it's all making money to these guys. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1648.86s)]
*  And it's not a new thing, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1650.78s)]
*  Republican Party has been about this for generations. They have someone in Donald Trump now who's [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1651.94s)]
*  a billionaire himself who wants to do it to such a degree that where people will die. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1656.5s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries just said this on a call I got off. He said, if this passes, the floor [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1662.46s)]
*  of the house will become a crime scene. And I fully agree with that characterization. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1666.46s)]
*  It's murder. It's killing people. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1672.3s)]
*  See, Liz. Unbelievable. Just stick with me. And here is Hakeem Jeffries. He just mentioned [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1674.38s)]
*  cut eight, go. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1680.06s)]
*  And as a result, people are going to die. Connected to this one big ugly bill. Tens [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1681.3799999999999s)]
*  of thousands of unnecessary American deaths per year. Shame on Republicans for even bringing [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1690.5s)]
*  this bill to the House floor. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1698.6599999999999s)]

*  John McCain level courage and stand up in defense. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1710.8999999999999s)]

*  Of the American people. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1722.5s)]

*  The gentleman just ended by saying to vote for this big beautiful bill. This big beautiful [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1729.6599999999999s)]
*  bill. Well, if beauty is in the eye of the beholder, then you, GOP, you have a very [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1735.54s)]
*  blurred vision of what America is about. Is it beautiful to cut off food from seniors [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1741.22s)]

*  People from health care. Is it beautiful to do this, to give tax cuts to billionaires [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1757.02s)]
*  in our country? Is it beautiful, beautiful to take money from education and the rest? [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1763.18s)]
*  The list goes on and on. Dr. King nearly 60 years ago said of all the forms of inequality, [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1769.22s)]
*  injustice in health is the most shocking and the most inhuman because it often results [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1776.78s)]
*  in physical death. We come to this floor with a moral force of Dr. King's words in our heart. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1782.8200000000002s)]
*  Let us not with this bill turn the American dream he talked about in a nightmare for America's [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1789.7s)]
*  seniors, the disabled, our children, our children, our children. Let us vote no on this shameful [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1796.3s)]

*  Don't you think, Mr. Producer? I'm going to take a break now. We're going to take some [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1809.9s)]
*  time to break this down. This is very, very important because this is what we hear more [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1816.06s)]

*  you're out to kill people and starve children. And I've had about enough of this. You're [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1826.1s)]

*  going on. We're going to do it through On Power, Chapter 4 on language. And I think [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1843.1s)]
*  you'll see why I'm trying to promote certain ideas and arguments, because we are surrounded [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1852.4199999999998s)]
*  by these cultural, political, and governmental evils. So when it comes to language, I point [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1861.22s)]
*  out the pursuit and maintenance of negative power, which is what the left stands for. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1868.6200000000001s)]
*  Require the utilization of negative techniques of communication, including manipulation, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1875.18s)]
*  deception, repetition, deceit, concealment, distraction, and fear-mongering in language [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1880.46s)]
*  that is intimidating, self-serving, and orchestrated. Now, does that not describe exactly what you [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1888.38s)]
*  just heard, Mr. Producer? It is an approach that seeks to arouse prejudices and stifle [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1895.38s)]
*  independent thought. The purpose is to exert power over language and to control the population [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1903.0200000000002s)]
*  without moral reservations. Indeed, morality itself is said to be relative or nothing but [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1912.3000000000002s)]
*  an abstraction, concealing the rot of open societies and democracies and obfuscating [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1917.8600000000001s)]
*  the exploitation of the people. In the political context, when language is applied this way, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1923.5s)]
*  it strikes a central part of the democratic system, denying the body politic information [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1931.58s)]
*  with which to make knowledgeable, qualitative, and collective decisions. And, ladies and [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1937.78s)]
*  gentlemen, this book comes out in four weeks and I think describes to a T, a T, what you're [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1942.3s)]
*  hearing and watching right now. Of course, this is the intention of its practitioners. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1950.3s)]
*  Moreover, communication of this sort exists for the purpose of arousing and angering the [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1955.58s)]
*  citizenry and exhorting them to action that is destructive of the existing society and [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1960.06s)]
*  their own lives and lifestyles in service to the demagogue and his aims. So we're talking [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1965.46s)]
*  about this guy running in New York, I'm talking about these democrats and what they're saying [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1970.22s)]
*  about this bill and so forth. But I didn't know about the democrat who was running at [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1973.98s)]
*  the time I wrote this. And as much as the people and their consent are the only legitimate [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1980.46s)]
*  and just source of government, the entire enterprise becomes corrupt and malevolent. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1985.82s)]
*  Unfortunately, citizens acquiesce to it, regurgitate it, or even demand it, or applicable, vote [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1991.26s)]
*  for it, believing there is no other course, that it is the best course, until it's too [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=1998.82s)]
*  late to reverse course without an abrupt and often violent revolt. But for many, suffering [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2004.42s)]
*  persists for an extended period of time. Now these two paragraphs describe presciently [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2010.06s)]
*  exactly what's going on in New York, exactly what's going on in Capitol Hill, what's going [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2018.7s)]
*  on in this country right now. And then I provide a little context for you. For example, prior [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2023.18s)]
*  to the Russian Revolution, Britannica finds that in Vladimir Lenin's 1902 pamphlet, that's [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2030.3400000000001s)]
*  before the revolution, what is to be done, he argues, and I'm quoting Britannica here, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2036.9s)]
*  that the propagandist whose primary medium is print, remember this is back then, explains [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2043.38s)]
*  the causes of social inequities such as unemployment or hunger, while the agitator, whose primary [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2047.78s)]
*  medium is speech, seizes on the emotional aspects of those issues to rouse his audience [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2054.06s)]
*  to indignation or action. Agitation is thus the use of political slogans and half-truths [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2059.62s)]
*  to exploit the grievances of the public, and thereby to mold public opinion and mobilize [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2067.34s)]
*  public support. Propaganda, by contrast, is the reason used of historical and scientific [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2072.98s)]
*  arguments to indoctrinate the educated and so-called enlightened members of society such [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2079.2200000000003s)]
*  as party members, such as Democrats. The combination of agitation with propaganda is called agitprop, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2085.6600000000003s)]
*  A-G-I-T-P-R-O-P. The term agitprop was originated and invented by the Soviet Union in 1923. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2095.1800000000003s)]
*  The Soviet Union and its Communist Central Committee Secretariat. I want to go on with [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2102.78s)]
*  this, we're going to take a break, I hope you'll stick with me, I think it's crucially [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2109.2200000000003s)]
*  important because this is precisely what is taking place. When you watch how I write these [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2112.34s)]
*  books, American Marxism explains the whole Marxist process that's been going on and tailored [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2118.6200000000003s)]
*  for the United States, and the West really. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2123.5s)]
*  I want to read something to you folks, Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy in America. Democracy [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2126.5s)]
*  in America is really two volumes of what he wrote as he was traveling in America. He died [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2142.82s)]
*  at a very young age, I think he was about 50, and these two volumes which together are [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2149.82s)]
*  Democracy in America, they really weren't read very much and they certainly weren't [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2156.7000000000003s)]
*  popular for about half a century, and now they are embraced strongly by people like [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2161.6600000000003s)]
*  me. And so, in my book on power I quote the following paragraphs, and tell me what you [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2167.5800000000004s)]
*  think. And by the way, this is what we're going to do at the Reagan Library, we have [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2175.06s)]
*  interactive interaction, it's an intimate discussion, it's just fantastic just for those [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2178.82s)]
*  of you who have never participated. In his book Democracy in America, Alexis de Tocqueville, [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2184.42s)]
*  the renowned French political scientist and historian who traveled throughout America, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2189.1800000000003s)]
*  presciently wrote in 1840 what he believed could be America's downfall as a democracy, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2195.02s)]
*  a massive administrative state. Here's what he said, Above this race of men stands an [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2199.78s)]
*  immense and tutelary power, which takes upon itself alone to secure their gratifications [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2206.52s)]
*  and to watch over their fate. The power is absolute, minute, regular, prominent and mild. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2215.12s)]
*  It would be like the authority of a parent if, like that authority, its object was to [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2222.16s)]
*  prepare men for manhood, but it seeks, on the contrary, to keep them in perpetual childhood. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2227.48s)]
*  It is well content that the people should rejoice provided they think of nothing but [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2234.28s)]
*  rejoicing for the happiness such as a government willingly labors, but it chooses to be the [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2238.2000000000003s)]
*  sole agent, does the government, and the only arbiter of that happiness it provides for [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2245.36s)]
*  their security, foresees and supplies their necessities, facilitates their pleasures, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2250.6800000000003s)]
*  manages their principal concerns, directs their industry, regulates the descent of property [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2257.76s)]
*  and subdivides their inheritances. What remains but to spare them all the care of thinking [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2263.3199999999997s)]
*  and all the trouble of living? Thus it every day renders the exercise of the free agency [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2269.12s)]
*  of man less useful and less frequent. It circumscribes the will with any narrow range and gradually [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2277.4s)]
*  robs a man of all the uses of himself. The principle of equality has prepared men for [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2283.24s)]
*  these things. It has predisposed men to ensure them, to endure them rather, and often to [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2288.64s)]
*  look on them as benefits. Absolute genius. It goes on, after having thus successfully [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2293.7599999999998s)]
*  taken each member of the community in its powerful grasp and fashioned him at will, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2302.24s)]
*  the supreme power then extends its arm over the whole community. It covers the surface [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2308.2s)]
*  of society with a network of small, complicated rules, minute and uniform, through which the [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2313.82s)]
*  most original minds of the most energetic characters cannot penetrate, to rise above [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2319.3s)]
*  the crowd. The will of man is not shattered but softened, bent and guided. Men are seldom [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2325.3s)]
*  forced by it to act, but they are constantly restrained from acting. Such a power does [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2334.1000000000004s)]
*  not destroy but it prevents existence, does not tyrannize but it compresses, innervates, [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2341.2999999999997s)]
*  extinguishes and stupefies a people, though each nascent is reduced to nothing better [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2348.42s)]
*  than a flock of timid and industrious animals, of which the government is the shepherd. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2353.06s)]
*  He said, I have always thought that servitude of the regular, quiet and gentle kind, which [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2360.62s)]
*  I have just described, might be combined more easily than is commonly believed with some [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2365.14s)]
*  of the outward forms of freedom, and that it might even establish itself under the wing [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2371.7799999999997s)]
*  of the sovereignty of the people. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2376.8199999999997s)]
*  Lexister Tocqueville, that's in my book, On Power, and it's very, very important, isn't [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2381.3399999999997s)]
*  it? Very important. And you see this happening in New York City right now. I don't care who's [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2386.3399999999997s)]
*  old or young, it doesn't matter. I also explain in the book that we never have a fulsome debate [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2395.1s)]
*  about what's going on, even when you listen to my friends in cable or in concert or talk [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2401.46s)]
*  radio. The exposition of this Democrat, I barely want to use his name, of this Democrat [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2409.18s)]
*  who's been nominated to run for mayor in New York City, begins and ends with a discussion [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2416.18s)]
*  about what he stands for. But what is not done, and what needs to be done, and what's [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2423.18s)]
*  done in this book is these people need to be exposed, not just by going point by point, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2430.22s)]
*  but explaining what the real cost is for these socialists, and what they're doing to make [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2437.22s)]
*  money, but explaining what the real cost is for these so-called free benefits that [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2442.22s)]
*  they're stealing from other people. The cost is your liberty. The cost is your free will. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2447.3799999999997s)]
*  Today it's the guy next door. Today it's the billionaire. Tomorrow it's the plumber down [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2457.58s)]
*  the street. If they have the power to do this to the powerful, by God, they have the power [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2462.62s)]
*  to do it to anybody. That's the point. Your kingdom is your kingdom. People are proud [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2468.48s)]
*  of their homes, whether they're row homes or townhouses, whether they're condominiums, [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2476.2400000000002s)]
*  whether they're single family homes, whether they're single floors, ten floors, whether [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2480.08s)]
*  it's 10,000 square feet or 1,200 square feet. That's your castle. That's your home. That [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2484.92s)]
*  was your labor, your intellectual and physical labor. You did that. You made that. That's [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2490.52s)]
*  where you're supposed to be secure and safe and have your investment for somebody to step [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2496.52s)]
*  in like this guy wants to, and he says, you know, we're going to have community homes [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2501.52s)]
*  where the government's going to come in and they're going to buy it. Beyond the market, [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2506.52s)]
*  he says. Beyond the market. My God, ladies and gentlemen, people are actually voting [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2509.72s)]
*  for tyranny and totalitarianism. They're voting to destroy their liberty and their lives. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2517.32s)]
*  That's the responsibility of people like me who have microphones and TV cameras to explain, [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2524.92s)]
*  to confront, to challenge. Not just whine about it and point out the obvious. There [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2531.6000000000004s)]
*  is a cost to this. It's your lifestyle. It's your labor. It's your freedom. That's the [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2540.48s)]
*  cost. Surrender more liberty. Surrender more of your property. And then you can have nirvana [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2547.48s)]
*  and paradise. There is no nirvana or paradise on earth. Show me where it is. Show me where [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2562.84s)]
*  it's ever been. The closest thing is the United States of America. But only, only, only, only [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2568.96s)]
*  if it remains as the United States of America, which is what they want to destroy. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2578.04s)]
*  Folks, can I tell you something? This is why I do this radio show. This is why I do Fox. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2587.04s)]
*  This is why I do Blaze. This is why I wrote this book on power. There's no other reason. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2591.16s)]
*  I can retire tomorrow, have a very good life, but I'd be grinding my teeth right down to [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2597.08s)]
*  the gums. Right down to the gums. This is why I do what I do. At least for now, while [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2602.64s)]
*  I still have the energy. How can I abandon these platforms where I believe I'm explaining [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2617.2s)]
*  the nature of this country, the founding of this country, the reason we have this country, [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2624.2s)]
*  where I can use our constitution and free speech in order to communicate with you. Well, [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2631.2s)]
*  I'm still able to go to what I consider like when I go to the Reagan Library a couple of [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2639.2s)]
*  days, that's a town hall meeting for me. It's where I want to meet you and you meet me. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2644.2s)]
*  And we talk. You know, there's people who write books and there's people who have people [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2650.2s)]
*  write books for them and they slap their name on it. Have you noticed how consistent my [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2665.0s)]
*  books are? Except for Rescuing Sprite, which was a very important book. But the other 10 [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2671.24s)]
*  books. If you put one next to the other, they're actually volumes. There's volume one. Men [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2679.2s)]
*  in Black. There's volume two. Liberty and Tyranny. There's volume three. Ameritopia. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2689.24s)]
*  One after the one after the other. It's not an accident. I don't write self-help books. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2696.0s)]
*  I don't write books about who did this and who did that and made me what I am today and [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2703.72s)]
*  I don't care about that stuff. These are conversations in every platform I can think [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2708.72s)]
*  of, whether it's radio or television or digital TV or these books, this book, and they relate [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2721.0s)]
*  to exactly what's going on today. It's a goal to try and push back, to try and re-educate [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2728.54s)]
*  some people, educate some people, and move certain people to at least speak out at the [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2736.2599999999998s)]
*  dinner table or church or synagogue or wherever you go. That's the goal. That's what we're [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2744.54s)]
*  going to do at the Reagan Library. That's what we do at these other signings and so [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2754.38s)]
*  forth, but that's what we do right here in a less intimate situation. But nonetheless, [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2757.58s)]
*  I consider you family. I consider this a national town hall meeting every time I open [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2764.5s)]
*  my mouth. You're here voluntarily. Nobody puts a gun to your head. You've got a thousand [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2768.54s)]
*  things to do, but you're here. It's my responsibility. God gave me this. I don't really know how [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2774.38s)]
*  I got here. People say, how did you get here? I really don't know. I really don't, but I'm [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2784.74s)]
*  here. We all have an obligation and a role. This is mine, and I'm happy with it, and I'm [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2789.74s)]
*  proud of it, but it's mine, and this is what I try to do, to share it with you. Mark Levin. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2797.2999999999997s)]
*  The Great One makes your weekend even better. This is the best of Mark Levin. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2812.58s)]
*  I mean, think about this, folks. Think about what's going on here. You see the jobs numbers? [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2819.74s)]
*  More jobs created than expected. I mean, we hear this all the time under Trump, under [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2829.14s)]
*  Reagan, same thing. I mean, you have effectively no unemployment. I mean, there's some, but [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2833.7s)]
*  it's so low statistically. That's hardly true. You have effectively no inflation. The price [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2839.2999999999997s)]
*  of gasoline this holiday weekend is way down. The price of food in most instances is down. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2845.4s)]
*  Obviously we always want to do better. Housing prices around the country are down. Depending [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2854.4s)]
*  on whether you're a buyer or seller, that's either good or bad. The point is the economy's [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2860.2400000000002s)]
*  chugging along, and now with this bill that was passed, it is a massive tax cut across [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2865.6800000000003s)]
*  the board with special focus on people who work with their hands, who serve other people, [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2873.48s)]
*  and who have modest income. The Democrats keep talking about tax cuts for billionaires [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2885.16s)]
*  because what else are they going to say? What else are they going to say? So which tax cut [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2889.8399999999997s)]
*  is it for billionaires? Can somebody at some point, one of these reporters asked the Democrats, [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2897.84s)]
*  what tax cut is for billionaires? What are you talking about? Now there could be a tax [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2903.32s)]
*  cut that encompasses everybody that affects billionaires, but what is the tax cut for [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2908.48s)]
*  billionaires? Which one is it? Now you don't know, and I don't know, because there isn't [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2912.6400000000003s)]
*  one. So they keep saying tax cuts for billionaires. Well, which one is it? There aren't any. They're [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2917.1600000000003s)]
*  liars. But you know they're liars. They are in their media. That's what they do. They [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2924.48s)]
*  lie. And I have a few goons, thugs, and knuckleheads in the Republican Party who do the same thing, [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2928.52s)]
*  just like the Israeli attack on Iran or our attack on the nuclear sites, World War III. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2938.3999999999996s)]
*  Katarlson was talking about that. Pardon me. What's that slob's name again? I don't know. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2945.44s)]
*  CNN was talking about it. Marjorie Trader Green, still talking about it. They've become [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2952.44s)]
*  irrelevant. Irrelevant. The Democrats are either becoming irrelevant or, depending on [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2959.7200000000003s)]
*  which one you listen to, more extremist. They don't represent the American people. They [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2968.08s)]
*  hate you. They hate you. They lie to you incessantly. I mean, people don't understand the American [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2974.2000000000003s)]
*  people. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2982.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2982.8s)]
*  President Trump is pushing through his agenda with the tiniest of margins in the House and [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2983.12s)]
*  the Senate. And you have to give a lot of credit to Mike Johnson. He's a hell of a speaker. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2988.64s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy was, too, by the way. But this Mike Johnson, he's like the Houdini of legislation. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2993.84s)]
*  He's able to get these things done. It's unbelievable. It really is. Of course, he has the help of [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=2999.54s)]
*  President Trump. But he's still the quarterback in the House of Representatives trying to [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3004.7400000000002s)]
*  serve the American people in the present and get this thing done. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3011.08s)]
*  And Thune over in the Senate did a very good job too. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3018.0s)]
*  So sometimes we should take a victory lap. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3021.88s)]
*  It's okay. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3024.88s)]
*  Is there a lot more to do? [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3026.22s)]
*  Well, of course there is. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3027.22s)]
*  There's a lot more to do. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3031.2799999999997s)]
*  The lower courts were pushed back by the Supreme Court the other week. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3035.3199999999997s)]
*  That's a good thing. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3038.64s)]
*  A good thing. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3040.68s)]
*  The role of parents and the raising of their children was supported by the Supreme Court. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3044.72s)]
*  That is a good thing. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3050.3999999999996s)]
*  This bill includes school choice. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3051.3999999999996s)]
*  This is a good thing. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3052.7999999999997s)]
*  It's a good thing. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3056.48s)]
*  Do we need to slash spending? [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3057.48s)]
*  You better believe we do. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3059.16s)]
*  But what did I write in the Liberty Amendments? [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3060.56s)]
*  Washington can't do it. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3062.6s)]
*  It just can't do it. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3064.3399999999997s)]
*  And so we need our states to step up, our state legislatures, don't we? [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3068.4s)]
*  And to begin the process of capping and limiting the percentage of the GDP that the federal [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3072.92s)]
*  government can spend. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3081.76s)]
*  But you can't do that in a single budget bill all of a sudden with the tiniest of majorities. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3083.08s)]
*  This is the reality. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3088.6400000000003s)]
*  And many of the people who are yammering away, they don't even support Convention of States. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3091.32s)]
*  So you can of course support Convention of States and this bill at the same time, understanding [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3097.56s)]
*  reality. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3101.92s)]
*  I said Washington can't do what needs to be done. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3102.92s)]
*  That said, the states can. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3107.64s)]
*  It's fantastic what's taking place here. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3112.24s)]
*  I'm very excited about it. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3117.2799999999997s)]
*  Very excited about what the court has done. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3119.08s)]
*  It's going to disappoint us. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3121.2s)]
*  Don't worry. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3122.36s)]
*  That time will come. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3123.36s)]
*  Right now, these decisions have been excellent. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3124.36s)]
*  What's happened in the Middle East is superb, absolutely superb, that a single American [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3130.48s)]
*  military personnel wounded, let alone killed in any of these actions. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3137.28s)]
*  And Iran doesn't have a nuclear weapon or intercontinental ballistic missiles. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3144.6400000000003s)]
*  These people were all wrong. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3148.44s)]
*  They're a disgrace. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3149.92s)]
*  The border is secure. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3154.18s)]
*  This bill is going to triple basically the number of ICE individuals and the ability [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3156.7599999999998s)]
*  to have detention centers and so forth to really push people out of this country who [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3163.2999999999997s)]
*  shouldn't be here in the first place. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3168.8999999999996s)]
*  Terrible, horrible criminals in many cases. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3170.7799999999997s)]
*  You don't get enough credit. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3178.2799999999997s)]
*  You the American people. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3180.3399999999997s)]
*  I haven't heard anybody thank you. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3181.3399999999997s)]
*  I'm thanking you. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3183.16s)]
*  Because but for you, Donald Trump wouldn't be president of the United States. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3185.96s)]
*  But for you, we wouldn't have a majority in the Senate and the House. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3189.16s)]
*  You did this. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3191.64s)]
*  You wanted it. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3193.18s)]
*  You did it. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3194.5s)]
*  You voted. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3196.02s)]
*  And you got it. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3197.02s)]
*  And you got it. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3200.5s)]
*  All of you, and there were a lot of you, I'm told, who called Capitol Hill last evening [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3204.5s)]
*  and through the night and into the early morning, urging your representatives to vote for this [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3209.18s)]
*  bill. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3214.74s)]
*  I'm told you had an impact. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3215.74s)]
*  So I want to thank you. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3216.9s)]
*  I'm not saying it's the impact or what percent. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3218.38s)]
*  I'm just telling you, you had a very positive role. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3220.74s)]
*  And I want to thank each and every one of you in this audience who did it. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3225.34s)]
*  I have the best audience. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3228.14s)]
*  You're the best folks by far. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3229.14s)]
*  You're just terrific. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3231.94s)]
*  Now, tomorrow, as you know, is Independence Day, July 4th, 2025. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3234.86s)]
*  249 years ago, people keep saying 250, 249 years ago, the Declaration of Independence [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3244.86s)]
*  was signed after some pretty brilliant and emotional debating that took place in Philadelphia [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3253.82s)]
*  in what was the State Assembly Building, what we call Independence Hall now, the Second [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3264.94s)]
*  Continental Congress, the Second Continental Congress. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3273.98s)]
*  And there are a lot of states that were very skeptical about jumping into this war, which [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3280.14s)]
*  had already started. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3285.1s)]
*  Lexington and Concord had already been fought. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3287.1s)]
*  Bunker Hill had already been fought. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3290.1s)]
*  So you had several states, particularly in the South, that were selling a lot of cotton [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3292.1s)]
*  to Britain saying, why are we getting into this fight? [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3296.54s)]
*  They're not bothering us. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3298.66s)]
*  But they did. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3302.02s)]
*  So when we come back, I want to tell you a little bit about what took place 249 years [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3305.2999999999997s)]
*  and a few months ago at Lexington and Concord. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3312.2599999999998s)]
*  The shot heard around the world, you've heard that phrase, just to give you a very short [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3316.7s)]
*  little history lesson. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3320.1s)]
*  Many of you may already know this, but you're going to be celebrating tomorrow and throughout [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3322.5s)]
*  the week in our independence. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3327.1s)]
*  Mug the VIN. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3328.54s)]
*  We're giving you nothing but the best, the best of Mark Levin. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3336.14s)]
*  Battlefields. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3341.14s)]
*  Battlefields.org is a very great, great site. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3342.14s)]
*  April 19, 1775. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3347.14s)]
*  This is your history. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3352.14s)]
*  Facing an impending rebellion, British General Thomas Gage decided to seize weapons and gunpowder [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3355.14s)]
*  being stored in Concord, Massachusetts. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3361.2599999999998s)]
*  20 miles northwest of Boston to prevent violence. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3364.14s)]
*  Patriot spies soon got wind of Gage's plan. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3369.14s)]
*  Paul Revere and other riders spread the word, Dawes, of the 800 British regulars who were [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3373.14s)]
*  dispatched to Concord. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3379.14s)]
*  Departing Boston late in the evening of April 18, the King's troop marched into the small [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3382.14s)]
*  town of Lexington around 5 a.m. to find facing them a militia company of more than 70 men, [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3388.14s)]
*  led by Captain John Parker. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3395.14s)]
*  When the vanguard of the British force rushed forward upon the town green, Captain Parker [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3397.14s)]
*  immediately ordered his company to disperse. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3403.42s)]
*  At some point a shot rang out, historians still debate who fired it. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3407.2599999999998s)]
*  The nervous British soldiers fired a volley, killing seven and mortally wounding one of [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3411.8199999999997s)]
*  the retreating militiamen. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3417.26s)]
*  The British column moved on towards Concord, leaving the dead wounded and dying in their [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3420.0600000000004s)]
*  wake. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3425.46s)]
*  Parker and his men would have revenge later that afternoon. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3427.1000000000004s)]
*  Arriving in Concord around 8 a.m., British commanders Francis Smith and John Pickarron [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3431.5400000000004s)]
*  ordered several companies, about 220 troops in all, to secure the north bridge across [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3437.94s)]
*  the Concord River. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3443.5400000000004s)]
*  They continued on another mile to Barrett Farm, where suspected cash of arms and powder [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3445.7799999999997s)]
*  were presumably located. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3451.02s)]
*  But by the time the British arrived at the north bridge, a growing assembly of close [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3454.2599999999998s)]
*  to 400 militia from Concord and the surrounding towns had gathered on the high ground overlooking [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3459.46s)]
*  the north bridge. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3466.7s)]
*  From their vantage point, their vantage point on the hill, they could see smoke rising from [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3468.8999999999996s)]
*  Concord. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3473.74s)]
*  The result of British burning some supplies that they had uncovered. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3475.22s)]
*  Thinking that town was put to the torch, Lieutenant Joseph Hosmer of Concord shouted to his fellow [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3479.5s)]
*  officers, will you let them burn the town down? [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3485.7799999999997s)]
*  The decision was then made to take action. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3490.22s)]
*  Colonel James Barrett ordered his companies to march upon the bridge, but not to fire [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3492.58s)]
*  upon the British soldiers unless first fired upon. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3497.8999999999996s)]
*  The Acton Company, commanded by 30-year-old Captain Isaac Davis, was placed at the head [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3501.3s)]
*  of the column. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3507.46s)]
*  When asked if they were prepared to confront the British troops, Davis said, I haven't [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3508.86s)]
*  a man afraid to go. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3513.0600000000004s)]
*  Now, first of all, isn't it amazing, these men of history that literally began the war [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3514.6200000000003s)]
*  for independence in 1775, nobody ever talks about them because nobody has ever heard of [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3520.98s)]
*  them because it's not taught. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3528.38s)]
*  Colonel James Barrett, Lieutenant Joseph Hosmer, just to some extent Captain Isaac [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3531.26s)]
*  Davis, 30 years old, they all put their lives on the line. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3539.5400000000004s)]
*  Incredible, incredible how much history we don't know and isn't taught. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3544.9s)]
*  So these Minutemen, and they were called Minutemen because in a minute's notice they were able [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3550.1000000000004s)]
*  to arm themselves and come to the core of the battle, the Minutemen formed up and marched [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3553.9s)]
*  down the hill. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3559.1000000000004s)]
*  As they did so, the British soldiers, intimidated by the colonial numbers and orderly advance, [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3560.42s)]
*  retreated to the opposite shore and prepared to defend themselves. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3566.74s)]
*  When Davis's company came within range, British soldiers opened fire, killing Isaac Davis [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3571.7799999999997s)]
*  and also Abner Hosmer, another Acton Minuteman. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3576.7799999999997s)]
*  Major Buttrick of Concord Shatter, for God's sake, fire, and the Minutemen replied with [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3581.54s)]
*  their own volley, killing three British soldiers and wounding nine others. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3586.58s)]
*  This volley, this volley, is considered the shot heard round the world at Concord. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3591.7s)]
*  The rest of the British troops retreated back to town. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3601.38s)]
*  Spith and Pickaren, the Brits, soon ordered a return to Boston, which developed into a [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3604.98s)]
*  rout as thousands of Minutemen patriots descended on the area as the British were attacked from [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3609.2599999999998s)]
*  all sides by swarms of angry Minutemen along with what is known as the Battle Road. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3615.06s)]
*  When they reached Lexington, John Parker and his men had their revenge, firing on the British [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3621.7s)]
*  regulars from behind cover. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3626.74s)]
*  For the next 12 miles, the British were continually ambushed by Minutemen shooting from behind [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3628.9s)]
*  trees, rock walls, and buildings. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3634.1s)]
*  The emotions of this fight carried well beyond April 19, inspiring American warriors to rise [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3636.78s)]
*  up and fight again, even in the face of staggering odds against them. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3642.02s)]
*  Having heard of the morning fighting at Lexington, British General Gage ordered Lord Percy to [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3648.54s)]
*  march from Boston with a relief column. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3653.86s)]
*  The column reached Smith and Pickaren's men on the eastern outskirts of Lexington, but [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3656.62s)]
*  Minutemen continued to pour in as word spread quickly throughout the area. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3661.18s)]
*  Among these Minutemen and militia companies were many African Americans, both free and [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3666.46s)]
*  slave, who took up arms and fought alongside with their white neighbors. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3672.38s)]
*  The British conducted a running fight until they could get under the cover of British [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3677.46s)]
*  guns and ships anchored at the waterways surrounding Boston. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3686.46s)]
*  By 8 p.m., it was clear that the day had been a disaster for the British. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3690.9s)]
*  They lost 73 killed and many more wounded compared to the Patriots' loss of 49. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3694.9s)]
*  Concord poet Ralph Waldo Emerson, dubbed from the embattled farmers, they were not American [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3702.2200000000003s)]
*  citizens yet. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3708.3s)]
*  That would have to wait until 1776 and the Declaration of Independence, our Declaration [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3710.06s)]
*  of Independence from Britain. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3715.32s)]
*  Then Americans became American citizens. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3717.7400000000002s)]
*  On April 19, 1775, they were simply loyal British subjects who believed that they were [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3720.66s)]
*  standing up to defend and fight for their rights. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3726.18s)]
*  In doing so, they changed the world forever. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3728.8199999999997s)]
*  Think about that. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYe1JykTXZA&t=3734.8999999999996s)]
