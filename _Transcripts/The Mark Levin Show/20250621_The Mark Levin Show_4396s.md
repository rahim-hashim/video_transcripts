Video Description: This week on the Mark Levin Show, those exploiting the MAGA movement for personal gain have been exposed. These fake MAGA figures, like Chatsworth Qatarlson (Tucker Carlson), are grifting, lying, and promoting anti-American sentiments while falsely claiming to support America First. They support regimes like Iran and Qatar, which funded terrorism and undermined U.S. interests. Fake MAGA is very upset that their team, Iran, is losing. They want you to believe that patriotism is isolationism.  Peace is not mere avoidance of conflict but a state secured through strength and decisive action against threats like Iran’s nuclear ambitions. No great president—Washington, Lincoln, Reagan, or Trump—would tolerate such dangers. "America First" prioritizes national security and global stability, not isolationism. It demands pragmatic, not ideological, foreign policy, assessing each threat uniquely. Labeling prudent action as "pro-war" is a misnomer; opposing nuclear-armed terrorists is pro-American.  A Kamala Harris presidency, aligning with appeasement, would weaken America and allies like Israel. Trump’s leadership, grounded in common sense, rejects endless wars but never shies from necessary action.  There’s a CNN poll showing 79% of Americans (83% Republicans, 79% Democrats/independents) oppose Iran’s nuclear ambitions, with a slight majority favoring U.S. airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear sites (69% of Republicans agree, 27% oppose).  This refutes the small group of isolationists, amplified by the media, who downplay Iran’s threat and align with left-wing narratives, asserting most Americans support Trump’s strong stance on national security. These isolationist voices are paper tigers who align with left-wing media to downplay Iran’s threat and question intelligence on Iran’s nuclear program and assassination attempts against President Trump.  Iran's nuclear ambitions and ballistic missile development pose an existential threat to Israel and American civilization, which cannot be ignored. Israel, possibly with U.S. assistance, will take military action to neutralize this threat, as Iran will not go away on its own. Iran's actions, including attacks via proxies and American casualties, demand a decisive military response, which is self-defense rather than nation-building. These radical Democrats, fifth-columnists, and isolationists lack any strategy and moral clarity.

# The Best Of Mark Levin - 6/21/25
**The Mark Levin Show:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw)
*  It's all quiet in the underground bunker. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=0.0s)]
*  Doors closed, locks bolted. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  But the Great One isn't just resting on his laurels. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=7.2s)]
*  He's making sure your weekend is even better by giving you his best. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=10.8s)]
*  This is the best of Mark Levin. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=15.6s)]
*  I want to thank you. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  I spent several weeks here, and now they've exposed themselves. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  That is individuals who have glommed onto the MAGA movement. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=28.4s)]
*  Donald Trump's movement. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=32.8s)]
*  To try and hijack it. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=35.6s)]
*  To try and grift off it. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=38.4s)]
*  To try and whore themselves as a result of it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=41.2s)]
*  And we've exposed them. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=46.2s)]
*  You and I. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=48.6s)]
*  We've exposed them. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=51.8s)]
*  Most of them are anti-American, while they keep talking about America first. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=55.4s)]
*  Israel is winning this war that started Friday evening, as we're on the air here. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=62.199999999999996s)]
*  It's only Monday evening. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=67.0s)]
*  They have fought a spectacular war thus far. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=71.2s)]
*  Not a single American soldier has been involved in any direct way. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=77.6s)]
*  Firing bullets or having bullets fired at them. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=82.0s)]
*  Thank God. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=86.2s)]
*  And yet the fake MAGA that has spent years lying to you, deceiving you, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=89.2s)]
*  separating you from your money. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=98.2s)]
*  They're very upset tonight. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=102.2s)]
*  Because their team, the Islamo-Nazi regime in Tehran, is losing. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=106.0s)]
*  They have coddled these regimes in the Middle East. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=114.0s)]
*  They have coddled a war criminal, Putin. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=119.6s)]
*  They want you to believe that patriotism is isolationism. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=126.0s)]
*  Even in the face of a country, a regime like Iran, that has killed 603 American soldiers, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=131.6s)]
*  that has maimed thousands of American soldiers, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=143.79999999999998s)]
*  and then fake MAGA is telling you that they stand for the United States military. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  While they're undermining the United States military and our assets, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=156.4s)]
*  that have been placed throughout the world, not just the Middle East, throughout the world. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=162.6s)]
*  Many of our military assets in the Middle East have nothing to do with Israel. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=168.4s)]
*  Chadwick Guttarlsen, his favorite, murderous monarchical regime, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=175.0s)]
*  has the biggest United States base in the Middle East. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=181.8s)]
*  He hasn't said that ought to close down. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=185.2s)]
*  He hasn't said we ought to withdraw our troops and our jets from that base. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=187.39999999999998s)]
*  No, he's busy wet kissing the dictator monarch of Qatar, which has funded Hamas, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=195.2s)]
*  which gave aid and comfort and cover and safe haven to the mastermind of 9-11. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=206.79999999999998s)]
*  When our FBI was about to nab him, the Qatari monarchy gave him a passport [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=212.0s)]
*  and a plane out of the country. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=219.8s)]
*  A year or two later, he attacked us on 9-11. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=222.0s)]
*  Chadwick Guttarlsen sucked up to that monarchy and that regime. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=226.6s)]
*  And he wants you to believe he's America first. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=235.2s)]
*  And he wants you to believe he cares about the cops and the firefighters. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=237.2s)]
*  He died in those towers. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=240.6s)]
*  He wants you to believe he cares about our military, when he could care less. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=242.2s)]
*  He hasn't called for the closure of the main base in Qatar, has he? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=247.0s)]
*  That's our biggest base. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=252.0s)]
*  We have a base in Iraq. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=254.29999999999998s)]
*  Israel didn't put the base in Iraq. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=261.3s)]
*  That base in Iraq isn't there for Israel. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=262.76s)]
*  When we went to war with Iraq, we put the base in Iraq. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=267.36s)]
*  So why are they focused on Israel, fake MAGA? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=276.16s)]
*  Because most of them are Jew haters and anti-Semites. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=280.36s)]
*  And most of them are America haters. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=283.88s)]
*  Not all. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=287.32s)]
*  Not all. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=289.16s)]
*  But most. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=290.16s)]
*  with Chadwick Guttarlsen. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=292.56s)]
*  How do they support our troops? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=298.06s)]
*  By telling them they're not needed? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=300.66s)]
*  Is that how they support our troops? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=303.88s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=307.36s)]
*  These guys are thugs. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=310.68s)]
*  When you challenge them in a substantive or intellectual way, they try to smear you. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=312.84000000000003s)]
*  So you gotta get down into the gutter and duke it out with them. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=320.88s)]
*  And what President Trump sees, what I see, what more and more people see, is that these [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=326.36s)]
*  people are not only paper tigers. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=333.88s)]
*  They're loathsome. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=336.24s)]
*  Absolutely loathsome. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=337.24s)]
*  Gave nothing in common with you. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=340.92s)]
*  Chadwick Guttarlsen is a trust fund baby. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=345.64s)]
*  From the Swanson frozen food dynasty. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=350.91999999999996s)]
*  He went to prep school. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=357.36s)]
*  He's got a preppy, sort of effeminate way about him. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=360.64s)]
*  The way he speaks and the way he laughs, the way he carries himself. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=365.68s)]
*  But he wants to be a regular guy, you see, so he shows up at UFC events. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=368.28s)]
*  He's a better guy. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=374.08s)]
*  Tough guy. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=376.35999999999996s)]
*  His team is losing. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=381.28s)]
*  So he trashes Donald Trump. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=385.02s)]
*  Those of you who voted for Donald Trump, those of you who support his policies, those of [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=389.24s)]
*  you who want to defeat the Democrats and the left, he does not. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=394.96s)]
*  Because now he's trashing Donald Trump. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=403.88000000000005s)]
*  It's only a matter of time. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=405.04s)]
*  So are the comedians that surround him and his ilk. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=407.44000000000005s)]
*  Comedians that aren't funny, that don't even tell jokes. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=412.40000000000003s)]
*  They just are a joke. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=415.72s)]
*  And most of them have never lifted a finger for this country. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=419.32000000000005s)]
*  And I don't even mean in battle. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=425.20000000000005s)]
*  I just mean in supporting our troops. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=427.88000000000005s)]
*  Supporting our cops, supporting our firefighters. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=431.52000000000004s)]
*  How have they? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=433.56s)]
*  When you are defending a regime in Iran, they're not just opposed to quote unquote war. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=439.72s)]
*  They are defending right now the regime in Iran. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=446.32s)]
*  The regime in Iran is about to fall in a few more weeks if the Israelis are left to finish [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=448.84000000000003s)]
*  them off. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=455.24s)]
*  But they think they have a lifeline. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=457.46s)]
*  And Chatsworth, Qatar, they think they have a lifeline. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=459.96s)]
*  In the jokes of these comedians who are podcasters. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=465.23999999999995s)]
*  With a young generation of people who happen to be among the most patriotic in the country. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=470.91999999999996s)]
*  They feed on them. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=480.2s)]
*  They lie to them. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=482.52s)]
*  They sell them. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=485.24s)]
*  They sell them hate for their own country, for our military, for Jews. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=487.04s)]
*  And notice there aren't evangelical Christians among them either. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=493.88s)]
*  Have you noticed that? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=497.04s)]
*  The vast majority of evangelical Christians and evangelical Christian leaders like my [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=499.04s)]
*  dear friend Pastor John Hagee and so many others. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=503.28000000000003s)]
*  They don't stand with these reprobates. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=507.44s)]
*  They want nothing to do with these reprobates. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=509.6s)]
*  I'll tell you why. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=511.36s)]
*  Evangelical Christians and Christians of people of good faith all over the world and [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=512.36s)]
*  especially in this audience and in this country. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=519.32s)]
*  They love the Holy Land and they know what will happen to the Holy Land. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=522.32s)]
*  They know what will happen to the birthplace of Judaism and Christianity. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=528.44s)]
*  They know what will happen if the Islamo-Nazis have their way. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=533.16s)]
*  The things I tell you, the things we talk about, they're not imaginary. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=542.16s)]
*  It's not fear-mongering. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=546.4s)]
*  That's what they do. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=547.88s)]
*  Will we hit on 9-11 or not? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=549.6s)]
*  Who hit us? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=551.4s)]
*  We have a whole TSA program. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=552.4s)]
*  Every time you get on an airplane you have to be hassled and so forth. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=554.4s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=557.48s)]
*  To protect us from Jews and Christians or Islamists and jihadis? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=558.68s)]
*  Who is it that's trying to assassinate our president? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=564.88s)]

*  Other than say, don't use our military. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=619.48s)]
*  Obviously it's a very serious matter when our military is entered into combat. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=624.2s)]
*  We elected a man, Donald Trump, our commander in chief, who's well aware of that. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=631.6800000000001s)]

*  attacks around the world. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=663.36s)]
*  He was the right hand of Khomeini. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=666.04s)]
*  He was killing our soldiers. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=669.76s)]

*  Trump took him out. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=675.16s)]
*  And Katarlsson and his ilk attacked Trump, said they would start World War III. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=677.4399999999999s)]
*  Well is there World War III? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=682.76s)]

*  Not one, maybe Qatar. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=689.06s)]
*  And maybe if Katarlsson likes Qatar so much, rather than hiding in Maine in his little [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=694.24s)]
*  Maybe he should go there. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=700.64s)]
*  Well he'll be fully welcomed. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=704.64s)]
*  Or maybe he can go to Moscow where he likes the subway system. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=706.28s)]
*  Just a thought. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=709.56s)]

*  They do love it. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1150.6200000000001s)]
*  And who gets to decide? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1156.06s)]
*  The isolationist radicals, they want you to believe that Donald Trump has deceived you, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1160.22s)]
*  that he's defied his own statements. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1167.46s)]
*  We've heard some of this from people on some of our friendliest platforms. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1169.46s)]
*  The problem is them. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1174.1s)]
*  That's their position. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1178.3999999999999s)]
*  It's never been Donald Trump's position. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1179.74s)]
*  He's never conducted himself that way. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1183.58s)]
*  You see, there's some confusion out there, and it's intentional. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1186.22s)]
*  That if you're prudent with the use of military force, use it as a last resort, but nonetheless [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1192.3s)]
*  feel the trigger needs to be pulled, you're a warmonger. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1198.1399999999999s)]
*  Over a mediaite, some guy wrote, Mark's pro-war. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1202.58s)]
*  I'm not pro-war. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1206.5s)]
*  I'm anti-terrorists with nuclear weapons who keep saying they're going to use it against [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1207.5s)]
*  us. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1210.74s)]
*  That's not pro-war. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1211.74s)]
*  That's pro-American. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1212.82s)]
*  I tried to have the gentleman come on the program tonight. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1213.82s)]
*  He refused. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1217.6200000000001s)]
*  Kobe Howell over at the mediaite. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1219.9s)]
*  He's the big guy there. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1222.98s)]
*  He said he didn't want to be insulted and so forth. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1223.98s)]
*  And so I looked, Kobe, I'll tell you what, you weren't going to be insulted. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1225.9s)]
*  I wanted to have a real discussion. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1229.06s)]
*  I don't understand what you do at mediaite. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1230.46s)]
*  All of you. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1233.26s)]
*  I don't understand why you have these hyper dishonest headlines. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1234.26s)]
*  I don't understand your mission. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1240.42s)]
*  And I wanted you to explain it to the American people because I see little distance between [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1242.5s)]
*  you and Media Matters. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1249.34s)]
*  And is that what you're about? [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1250.86s)]
*  Aggregating things, slapping crazy titles on them, and certainly from center, center [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1254.3s)]
*  left or left. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1259.06s)]
*  And I don't understand why you're an apologist for these extremists effectively when you [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1264.5s)]
*  give a description of Chatsworth Cattarolson and you leave out completely his anti-Semitism [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1269.6599999999999s)]
*  and his promotion of anti-Semites. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1275.8999999999999s)]
*  That's wrong. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1278.02s)]
*  But you didn't want to have that discussion. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1279.02s)]
*  It would have been a very professional discussion. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1280.54s)]
*  No name calling, no insults. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1282.78s)]
*  I had my producer tell you that. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1284.26s)]
*  I hope you'll rethink this. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1286.4199999999998s)]
*  I really do. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1288.5s)]
*  These guys can't do enough stories with me in them. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1292.1799999999998s)]
*  And then every year they put out a list. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1294.54s)]
*  Just influential media figures, right, Mr. Reducer? [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1296.64s)]
*  Well, if I'm not on your list of 65, why do you keep talking about me, writing about me [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1299.4s)]
*  and reporting about me? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1305.0800000000002s)]
*  Don't you think that's kind of dishonest? [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1306.2s)]
*  I should be right at the top of your stupid list, but it doesn't matter. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1308.72s)]
*  The vast majority of America doesn't know what media is if I don't mention it. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1313.2s)]
*  But it's part and parcel of the problem. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1317.3600000000001s)]
*  We have this site called Axios, which is quite left. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1318.64s)]
*  And they have a reporter there, Barack Ravine. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1323.36s)]
*  And he used to be the go-to guy for the Biden administration, for the Biden State Department, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1327.56s)]
*  them, and Politico, and a few others, were basically their scribes for people who leaked [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1333.08s)]
*  to them. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1338.36s)]
*  And in the Trump presidency, the isolationists are leaking like hell. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1341.36s)]
*  They're relentless. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1348.04s)]
*  They're doing this almost every day to him, mostly to him. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1349.04s)]
*  And all these stories, the president denies them, other people deny them, trying to show [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1352.56s)]
*  a terrible rift between Israel and the president or the United States and on and on and on. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1356.52s)]
*  And the president put out a statement today saying what they had was false. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1361.96s)]
*  And there are reports, as I surmised, about who's involved, which offices are involved. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1367.96s)]
*  But I'm going to keep my powder dry until there's a little bit more meat on that bone. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1375.96s)]
*  But it is as I expected. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1384.0s)]
*  I don't leak to the media, by the way, as a footnote. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1388.3400000000001s)]
*  You can ask the media. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1390.64s)]
*  I don't. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1391.64s)]
*  If I have something to say, I'll say it on the record. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1392.64s)]
*  I don't talk a lot to the media. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1397.64s)]
*  Conservative media, sure, but I'm talking about the corporate media. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1401.52s)]
*  Why should I? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1406.24s)]
*  I have a radio show, a TV show, I have a digital show. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1407.24s)]
*  I can talk to you directly. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1409.36s)]
*  And I don't believe what I say will be reported accurately anyway. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1412.4599999999998s)]
*  I've spent tens of thousands of hours behind this microphone explaining my views in great [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1416.6399999999999s)]
*  detail. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1423.04s)]
*  I've written 10 bestselling books with thousands of notes on the back footnotes and endnotes. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1424.04s)]
*  And this is what I want to discuss from the guy from MediEight. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1431.96s)]
*  Why is it that you never report about these things? [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1435.56s)]
*  You really want to know my view. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1439.8799999999999s)]
*  They're spelled out in exquisite detail over the course of over two decades. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1441.48s)]
*  My views are not a secret. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1448.44s)]
*  I'm here today to express them, to explain them, if necessary, to defend them or alter them. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1449.96s)]
*  Donald Trump has explained what America First means. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1457.64s)]
*  And we have really, really outliers, some of whom I think have serious psychological [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1466.08s)]
*  issues, who insist that they get to define or insist on projecting onto Donald Trump [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1473.2s)]
*  what their views are, even though Donald Trump has never embraced them. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1481.0s)]
*  Of course, he's embraced their support, needs votes, but he's never embraced their views. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1483.9199999999998s)]
*  I told you this and I've told you this over and over again. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1490.04s)]
*  Just to keep throwing the word around, peace, peace, peace, doesn't make it so, nor does [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1496.52s)]
*  it mean the people who keep using it are for peace or have any idea what peace is about. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1501.9199999999998s)]
*  If you have a guy next door and he keeps telling you he wants to kill you, and he supports [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1510.08s)]
*  and funds individuals who've killed family members of yours, and he's telling you he [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1518.1200000000001s)]
*  wants to get a weapon strong enough to blow your house up, you just sit there and say [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1526.1200000000001s)]
*  peace means just sitting on my ass and watching this and listening to this? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1535.08s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1538.44s)]
*  That's not peace. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1542.1200000000001s)]
*  Iran with nuclear weapons and now ballistic missiles, we've learned about, that's not [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1545.1200000000001s)]
*  peace. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1548.8400000000001s)]
*  The question is, how do you ensure peace? [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1550.28s)]
*  How do you ensure that the United States is never hit by these weapons? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1553.52s)]
*  You're talking about a seventh century barbarian police state, a primitive regime. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1557.0s)]
*  That believes their God requires them to kill us, as you'll learn when you read my book [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1569.0s)]
*  on power. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1577.3600000000001s)]
*  Now, we have a brain for a reason. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1580.46s)]
*  We take into consideration what we know, what we've experienced, what we've seen, what we [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1587.3s)]
*  know about the death cult. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1593.54s)]
*  It's called knowledge. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1599.0600000000002s)]
*  That's what human beings use to make decisions. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1600.0600000000002s)]
*  Those who promote this radical isolationist position, all they keep doing is yelling, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1605.66s)]
*  no more war. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1611.0600000000002s)]
*  Does the enemy agree with them? [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1612.0600000000002s)]
*  I mean, what is this, third grade? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1616.42s)]
*  And yet their conduct gave aid and comfort, I believe, to the Iranian regime. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1621.46s)]
*  They thought they could hang on listening to these people. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1626.66s)]
*  They were undermining the president's message. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1632.46s)]
*  He's making the decision. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1634.3400000000001s)]
*  You know, ladies and gentlemen, it's one thing to have a disagreement with President Trump. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1635.3400000000001s)]
*  It's one thing to have been never Trump. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1640.74s)]
*  You know, it's another thing to have been in aggressive primary where names are thrown [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1643.16s)]
*  around and so forth and so off. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1648.7s)]
*  Marco Rubio, JD Vance, not even in the primary. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1650.5s)]
*  You use some horrible things about Trump and so forth and so on, and you're done. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1654.1s)]
*  It's over and you move on. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1658.26s)]
*  And the president has brought people like this into his cabinet, into his confidence. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1661.34s)]
*  That's the way it works. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1665.3s)]
*  That's the way it worked when Ronald Reagan got elected and I worked for him. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1667.6999999999998s)]
*  And I remember all these Bush guys attacking him left and right, left and right. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1670.3799999999999s)]
*  What did he do? [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1673.4199999999998s)]
*  He appointed the top Bush guy, George H.W. Bush as vice president, just as he appointed [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1674.4199999999998s)]
*  JD Vance his vice president, despite being called Hitler and so forth. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1680.26s)]
*  That's not what I'm talking about. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1687.42s)]

*  he's none of those things. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1856.0s)]

*  there's no question. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1891.88s)]

*  I certainly don't want to be involved in it, but what are we doing? [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=1900.0s)]

*  They are grotesque, actually. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2214.64s)]
*  I've gone through this discussion before. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2219.5s)]
*  I just went and looked, Mr. Bidusian. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2221.06s)]
*  I've dealt with the War Powers Act before, have I not? [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2223.6s)]
*  Folks, you can go online and you can see my comments before. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2226.4s)]
*  See, there's a treaty clause of the Constitution, which I strongly support. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2229.88s)]
*  It's cut and dry. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2233.88s)]
*  It's clear. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2234.88s)]
*  We know the whole history behind it. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2235.88s)]
*  It's in the Constitution. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2237.36s)]
*  That if there had been or is some kind of a deal, to me, it should go to Congress. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2238.36s)]
*  Specifically, it should go to the Senate under the treaty provision. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2245.1600000000003s)]
*  But we have provisions in our Constitution. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2249.2400000000002s)]
*  The President of the United States, the Commander in Chief. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2251.12s)]
*  Now, when you look at Madison's notes and you understand the debate that took place, [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2253.28s)]
*  they said one person needs to be in charge of war. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2258.08s)]
*  One. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2262.76s)]
*  And so they created the President of the United States. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2265.0s)]
*  They said he's the Commander in Chief. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2266.94s)]
*  There was debate about Congress's participation. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2268.96s)]
*  There was debate on whether Congress had to be part of the military decision making. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2271.82s)]
*  And they decided, no, it's just too unruly. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2278.2000000000003s)]
*  And plus, if you have an urgency, it'll never get addressed. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2280.88s)]
*  There's also a declaration of war provision in the Constitution where Congress passes [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2286.9s)]
*  declaration of wars typically at the request of the Commander in Chief. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2293.98s)]
*  So you have the declaration of war provision and you have the Commander in Chief provision. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2298.1800000000003s)]
*  Where is there any authority whatsoever for Congress to pass the War Powers Act limiting [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2304.3s)]
*  the power of the President? [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2309.6s)]
*  Well, Mark, is he a king? [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2311.38s)]
*  And then people start to sound like all the Marxist Islamists out there. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2313.9s)]
*  Well, there's a third provision of the Constitution. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2317.26s)]
*  What is that? [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2320.06s)]
*  It's the spending clause. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2323.3s)]
*  Congress has the power to deny funds if it wishes for any military action. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2327.78s)]
*  Not even, doesn't have to be limited to a full blown war. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2335.1800000000003s)]
*  And Congress has done that before. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2339.9s)]
*  That's how we eventually lost in Vietnam. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2342.7000000000003s)]
*  Congress cut off the funds by a veto-proof majority. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2344.94s)]
*  Gerald Ford vetoed it and he lost. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2347.94s)]
*  And we had the boat people and all the other horrors that followed from that. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2351.54s)]
*  But Congress exercised its spending clause power. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2354.78s)]
*  That is the check on the President, not the War Powers Act. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2360.06s)]
*  They can't pass a statute and say, look at us, we've amended the Constitution. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2363.18s)]
*  I don't care what any court says, let alone the Supreme Court. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2367.46s)]
*  I don't even believe it's been fully challenged in that regard. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2370.06s)]
*  So now we have the so-called Tom Massey, Mr. Constitution, waving around the War Powers [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2375.02s)]
*  Act. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2380.06s)]
*  And then Mike Leo get in on it, some of the others, Rand Paul. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2381.1s)]
*  Look at this, we have a War Powers Act, 1973. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2384.02s)]
*  That's right, 1973. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2387.58s)]
*  It's not in the Constitution. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2392.62s)]
*  You can't alter the balance of power and the various authorities given to one branch or [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2394.7799999999997s)]
*  another with a statute, whether you want to or not. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2398.42s)]
*  Whether you claim to be a constitutionalist or not. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2401.94s)]
*  And so the use of the War Powers Act is nothing more than to try and prevent Donald Trump, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2407.38s)]
*  who's been very judicious, very prudential, very careful about what he's doing. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2412.38s)]
*  To take steps. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2422.94s)]
*  Now, now, if should he choose to do so, to help destroy these nuclear programs, these [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2424.86s)]
*  nuclear sites. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2431.94s)]
*  You're going to sit around and wait till what? [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2432.94s)]
*  Are they on vacation? [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2435.7400000000002s)]
*  You don't even know. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2436.74s)]
*  They can't even get a damn budget with tax cuts passed. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2437.74s)]
*  We want power over war. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2440.3399999999997s)]
*  You don't get power over this. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2441.8599999999997s)]
*  We have the right to declare war. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2444.54s)]
*  You do. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2446.02s)]
*  But your power to quote unquote challenge a war or end a war is the power of the purse, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2449.62s)]
*  not the power of declaration. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2457.2599999999998s)]
*  The declaration is an affirmative act. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2459.1s)]
*  And every military campaign is not a full on war. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2463.34s)]
*  It's not a full on war. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2470.1000000000004s)]
*  So now they're going to cite what is an illegitimate statute, an unconstitutional statute that [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2473.98s)]
*  steals power from the commander in chief, gives it to Congress, while these clowns sit [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2478.6400000000003s)]
*  on their ass and debate what? [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2483.92s)]
*  Unlike the treaty provision, which is quite specific, quite specific. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2490.9s)]
*  And so these radical libertarians, these isolationists, throwing in with the Democrats like Tlaib [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2500.58s)]
*  and Omar and the rest of the hate America crowd, all they're trying to do is obstruct, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2508.58s)]
*  undermine, handicap. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2516.02s)]
*  Because if the president of the United States was truly bound by every decision, when it [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2518.98s)]
*  comes to national security that involves a battle or more than one battle to get approval [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2524.7000000000003s)]
*  from Congress, then we'd never be safe ever. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2529.98s)]
*  And then the whole point of a commander in chief would be irrelevant, utterly irrelevant. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2536.38s)]
*  The framers didn't say we have a commander in chief and hopefully one day they'll pass [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2542.34s)]
*  a war powers act to limit him. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2545.78s)]
*  The state doesn't say that. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2548.02s)]
*  Congress shall declare war. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2552.62s)]
*  But every military campaign is not a war. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2556.78s)]
*  It's not a full on war. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2561.42s)]
*  I'm sorry if people are upset about this. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2568.94s)]
*  That's the way it is. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2570.78s)]
*  So now we have, you know, the Marxists trying to seize power from the president through [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2574.5400000000004s)]
*  their courts. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2580.7000000000003s)]
*  Now we have the radical libertarian isolationists throwing in with Bernie Sanders and AOC and [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2583.82s)]
*  Daniel K trying to undermine and seize power from the power of the presidency. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2591.5800000000004s)]
*  So my advice to Mr. Massey, my advice to Mr. Paul and Manny Melon Jack and the Marx brothers [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2599.58s)]
*  and everybody else in Congress, stop pissing up the wrong tree. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2608.54s)]
*  If you think you can really stop the president and you really want to stop the president, [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2615.5s)]
*  then use the power of the purse. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2621.66s)]
*  Here's their problem. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2623.06s)]
*  The president has to sign it and they don't have a veto proof number on this. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2625.02s)]
*  So they want to skirt it. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2629.02s)]
*  That's why I'm just being honest with you. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2630.38s)]
*  They want to accuse him of you violated the War Powers Act, which he should. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2633.04s)]
*  By the way, every president should. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2638.06s)]
*  In my humble opinion. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2641.22s)]
*  This is another straw man, another fig leaf to what they really intend here. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2645.96s)]
*  Now can you remember, ladies and gentlemen, the last time we've discussed the War Powers [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2651.34s)]
*  Act, the War Powers Act? [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2654.84s)]
*  Can you? [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2658.62s)]
*  It's not under a Democrat, is it? [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2660.74s)]
*  We were funding Ukraine. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2667.46s)]
*  Did that require the triggering of the Wars Power Act? [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2669.74s)]
*  If it did, I didn't hear anybody talk about it. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2671.8599999999997s)]
*  Did you? [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2675.06s)]
*  Unlike most people, I guess. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2678.42s)]
*  I support supporting Ukraine. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2681.2999999999997s)]
*  That's not my question. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2687.26s)]
*  Whether you support Ukraine or not, or whether you. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2689.1800000000003s)]
*  I mean, unbelievably support Putin. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2693.94s)]
*  That's not my question. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2696.94s)]
*  You never heard anybody talk about the Wars War Powers Act on the Democrat side. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2700.6200000000003s)]
*  I don't remember Massie talking about maybe he did. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2704.6200000000003s)]
*  But he's such a irrelevant squeak when he speaks. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2709.38s)]
*  It doesn't really matter. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2711.6200000000003s)]
*  Mark. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2712.6200000000003s)]
*  The great one makes your weekend even better. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2713.62s)]
*  This is the best of Mark Levin. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2727.7799999999997s)]
*  This is his fellow, Harry Inton, the CNN chief data analyst. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2730.94s)]
*  This guy makes boring polls sound exciting, fabulous, credible. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2734.68s)]
*  They're lucky to have him. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2741.38s)]
*  I think he's the only guy over there worth having other than the conservative. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2742.42s)]
*  And I don't mean to be rude whose name I can't remember. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2746.02s)]
*  What is his name? [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2748.34s)]
*  Scott Jennings. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2750.02s)]
*  Sorry there, Scott. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2751.02s)]
*  I want you to listen to Harry Inton. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2753.06s)]
*  This is very important to you. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2754.58s)]
*  I'm sure. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2755.9s)]
*  CNN chief data analyst. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2756.9s)]
*  Cut 17. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2758.54s)]
*  Go. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2759.54s)]
*  And overall, I feel like there's more support for Donald Trump's positions than is comically [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2760.54s)]
*  acknowledged. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2763.34s)]
*  Oppose Iran getting a nuclear weapon. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2764.34s)]
*  I mean, look at this. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2765.34s)]
*  Seventy nine percent of adults agree on that. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2766.34s)]
*  They agree with Donald Trump. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2768.3s)]
*  Iran cannot get a nuclear weapon. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2769.3s)]
*  83 percent of Republicans, 79 percent of independents, 79 percent of Democrats. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2770.9s)]
*  When you get 79 percent of Democrats and 83 percent of Republicans agreeing on anything, [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2775.98s)]
*  you know that that position is the very clear majority in this country. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2780.46s)]
*  And so the American public is with Donald Trump. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2784.02s)]
*  They definitely oppose Iran getting nuclear weapons. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2786.1800000000003s)]
*  So this is a nuance here. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2788.86s)]
*  But Trump and Netanyahu both arguing that Iran is close to being capable of making a [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2790.5s)]
*  nuclear weapon. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2795.78s)]
*  If that is the case, what is the feeling of Americans as to whether the United States [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2796.78s)]
*  should get involved in this complex? [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2800.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2802.54s)]
*  If you buy Donald Trump's theory of the case, and I think that's important to note this [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2803.54s)]
*  is polling from from April for ranch trying to make a nuclear weapon. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2806.18s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2810.22s)]
*  Overall, you get the slight plurality. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2811.22s)]
*  I mean, it's within the margin of error, but the slight plurality of Americans actually [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2812.5s)]
*  favor U.S. airstrikes compared to 47 percent opposing it. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2815.82s)]
*  Now here's the other nugget I'll note. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2819.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2820.78s)]
*  There's been a lot of talk online and on social media and in podcasts of a divide within the [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2821.78s)]
*  Republican ranks. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2826.06s)]
*  But here on this question, if Iran's trying to make a nuclear weapon, look at that. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2827.22s)]
*  Sixty nine percent of Republicans, the clear vast majority of Republicans favor U.S. airstrikes [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2830.8199999999997s)]
*  on Iran on their nuclear facilities. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2835.8599999999997s)]
*  But there is this substantial minority, 27 percent, who oppose such an idea. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2837.7599999999998s)]
*  So it's not surprising you're hearing those other voices besides Donald Trump out there. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2841.8199999999997s)]
*  There are plenty of them in the Republican ranks who oppose striking the U.S. striking [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2845.66s)]
*  Iran if they're trying to make a nuclear weapon. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2850.2999999999997s)]
*  But the clear majority, the clear majority of Republicans are with Donald Trump if, in [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2852.26s)]
*  fact, Iran is trying to make nuclear weapons. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2857.1400000000003s)]
*  They do, in fact, potentially favor U.S. airstrikes. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2858.9s)]
*  So to cut through all this, and he does a tremendous job. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2862.2200000000003s)]
*  Sixty nine percent of Americans, so seven out of, excuse me, sixty nine percent of Republicans, [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2867.5400000000004s)]
*  seven out of ten Republicans believe that the U.S. should hit our bombers, Iran's nuclear [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2873.6200000000003s)]
*  sites. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2882.14s)]
*  Seventy percent, sixty nine percent. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2883.14s)]
*  And in terms of making sure that Iran does not have nuclear weapons, incredible. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2890.24s)]
*  Eighty three percent of Republicans, seventy nine percent of Democrats, seventy nine percent [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2895.8599999999997s)]
*  of independents. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2900.06s)]
*  So you see, ladies and gentlemen, the isolationists, I've been telling you this for week after [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2901.06s)]
*  week after week. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2905.58s)]
*  It's a small cabal. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2906.66s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2908.04s)]
*  They have platforms. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2910.3s)]
*  Then they are those platforms when they make their outrageous statements and do their outrageous [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2913.02s)]
*  things. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2917.22s)]
*  They are cycled through entities like MediaEight and the Drudge Report and so forth and so [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2918.46s)]
*  on to try and give them a voice. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2923.82s)]
*  Why? [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2926.26s)]
*  Because they want you to believe that the Republican Party is like the Democrat Party [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2927.26s)]
*  when it comes to national security, when it comes to taking out nuclear warheads, or potentially [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2931.2s)]
*  when it comes to Israel. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2939.46s)]
*  It's all a lie. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2940.82s)]
*  As again, I've been trying to say. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2941.82s)]
*  This battle over the last month with me and the isolationists has exposed them. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2945.34s)]
*  They're feckless. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2951.26s)]
*  They're paper tigers. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2952.26s)]
*  That's what they are. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2953.58s)]
*  And then they turn on Donald Trump. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2955.66s)]
*  And then Donald Trump turns on them. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2958.34s)]
*  And then they have a problem. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2961.06s)]
*  A big problem. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2963.18s)]
*  The red blooded Americans are not isolationists, appeasers, pacifists. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2965.78s)]
*  We're people with common sense. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2971.9s)]
*  People believe you look at a situation, you figure out who the good guys are and the bad [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2974.5400000000004s)]
*  guys are. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2977.7000000000003s)]
*  If you can help, we help. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2978.7000000000003s)]
*  Not about a forever war. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2980.3s)]
*  It's not about World War III. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2981.46s)]
*  The American people aren't buying any of this crap. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2983.6200000000003s)]
*  And they know Iran. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2986.3s)]
*  We know Iran. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2988.86s)]
*  They've been with us for 47 years, this regime. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2989.86s)]
*  They've killed Americans, American soldiers. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2994.26s)]
*  They've tried to assassinate our president. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2997.7400000000002s)]
*  What's getting interesting now, you might recall a couple of weeks ago, ladies and gentlemen, [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=2999.3s)]
*  when I was dealing with Qatarilson, who really is a paper tiger, absolutely lightweight, [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3004.42s)]
*  and his following is an inch deep. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3011.46s)]
*  When I was dealing with him, you'll notice the Politico. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3014.5400000000004s)]
*  Rachel Bade come to his defense. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3018.3s)]
*  Then the Independent came to his defense. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3020.1000000000004s)]
*  Then Media Ogerite came to his defense. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3021.94s)]
*  Then the Daily Beastiality came to his defense. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3024.26s)]
*  Then the Huffington Comp, all these outlier media entrails. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3027.42s)]
*  Same left-wing ideologues, same Democrat mouthpieces and so forth and so on in terms of their mindset. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3033.98s)]
*  They question the intelligence about the nuclear sites. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3040.86s)]
*  They question the intelligence about the attempts to assassinate Donald Trump. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3045.86s)]
*  We actually have a case at the Department of Justice. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3050.54s)]
*  I believe it was started in the Biden administration. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3053.46s)]
*  So just like Biden isn't as dumb as he sounds and seems and walks and talks. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3056.18s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3060.46s)]
*  So the same media and their entrails, except this time with the isolationists, want you [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3062.32s)]
*  to believe Iran's not a threat. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3067.74s)]
*  They don't have nukes. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3071.5s)]
*  Look at them. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3072.62s)]
*  What exactly is Israel bombing? [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3074.44s)]
*  And energy sites? [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3078.34s)]
*  We all know. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3081.26s)]
*  We see it. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3082.26s)]
*  We hear it. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3083.26s)]
*  Just like we did with Biden, just like we did with the Hunter laptop. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3084.26s)]
*  They're pulling the same thing, except this time they have the isolationists almost as [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3087.78s)]
*  a fifth column, as a fifth column in this country, joining with them. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3092.62s)]
*  They're ideological. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3096.94s)]
*  Ideological knuckleheads. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3099.62s)]
*  We're going to have a guest on in the second hour who's going to explain what their surveys [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3100.62s)]
*  found. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3106.2599999999998s)]
*  Very thorough, very comprehensive surveys. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3107.2599999999998s)]
*  Very similar to the CNN poll. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3110.3399999999997s)]
*  Very similar. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3113.66s)]
*  Donald Trump's position has been known from day one. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3114.66s)]
*  We should be supporting what he's trying to do now. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3122.66s)]
*  We should be supporting the prime minister of Israel. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3125.58s)]
*  We should be supporting the Israeli military. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3128.8999999999996s)]
*  We should be supporting our military. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3130.94s)]
*  We should encourage them to work as closely together as possible to wipe out this enemy, [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3133.74s)]
*  their nuclear weapons, in which they want to kill us. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3139.52s)]
*  That's the bottom line. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3146.22s)]
*  I understand why Tlaib and Omar and AOC and Sanders and the rest of the Marxist Islamists [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3148.14s)]
*  are not with us. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3154.4599999999996s)]
*  But these people who've turned on us, these people who've turned on us, these isolationists [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3156.2999999999997s)]
*  with their podcasts and their subscription services and all the rest, hell to them. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3162.06s)]
*  When the rubber hit the road, they were on the side of the enemy. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3170.34s)]
*  They'll say they're not, but they are. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3174.86s)]
*  They're on the side of Tlaib. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3177.62s)]
*  They're on the side of Bernie Sanders. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3178.9s)]
*  They sound like Bernie Sanders. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3180.34s)]
*  And I don't want to hear this stuff. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3182.54s)]
*  I guess we will, but I don't want to hear it. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3183.74s)]
*  I support Israel, but I oppose war. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3185.7s)]
*  Well, good for you. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3187.7799999999997s)]
*  The problem for Israel is they're under attack constantly on all sides. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3189.86s)]
*  So you may oppose war sitting here in the United States. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3194.88s)]
*  That's a wonderful thing. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3199.0s)]
*  But when you're under attack in direct ways and terrorist ways and other ways, and you [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3200.54s)]
*  have been for 47 years by the same primitive, barbarian, seventh century Islamists, you [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3204.9s)]
*  can't just preach. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3213.1s)]
*  You know, I support Israel, but I oppose war. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3214.5s)]
*  I see General Michael Flynn. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3219.02s)]
*  General Michael Flynn has made the point. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3221.06s)]
*  I'm against stupid wars, but I'm not necessarily against war. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3223.94s)]
*  And when the state of Israel is under attack, directly and indirectly, I support, if necessary, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3228.18s)]
*  a war to stop it. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3234.78s)]
*  But 80% of the American people, 83%, agree with you and me and the president. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3240.38s)]
*  83%. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3246.18s)]
*  And 69% of Republicans believe that the United States should participate in blowing out these [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3249.98s)]
*  nuclear sites. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3258.38s)]
*  Completely different than what you've been hearing on cable, completely different than [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3260.7400000000002s)]
*  what you've been hearing from podcasters, many of them, some on conservative talk radio. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3265.06s)]
*  Again, I will tell you for the 5,000th time, [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3269.94s)]
*  Rush always told me, [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3273.9s)]
*  respect your audience, respect their intelligence. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3277.9s)]
*  When I come behind here, I'm talking to you. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3281.9s)]
*  I'm not talking to the entrails. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3286.9s)]
*  I'm not talking to the isolation. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3288.7000000000003s)]
*  I'm talking to you. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3289.9s)]
*  And you know I give you the truth. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3291.9s)]
*  I give you the information I have. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3293.9s)]
*  You don't necessarily have to agree with me. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3294.9s)]
*  That's OK. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3296.9s)]
*  That's not the point. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3297.9s)]
*  But I'll give you the best information I have. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3299.9s)]
*  That's not what you get in American media. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3301.9s)]
*  That's not what you get from mediaite and the Drudge Report, Politico and Axios. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3303.9s)]
*  Axios is the favorite leaking point of the isolationists who side with Hamas in some [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3308.9s)]
*  instances, but clearly side with the Iranian government. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3316.9s)]
*  You can't say, no, no, we can't use military action or we can't back up the Israelis who [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3319.9s)]
*  are using military action to take out the nuclear weapons there and then say, you're [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3324.9s)]
*  for Israel, but you're not for Iran. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3329.9s)]
*  No, you're for Iran. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3331.9s)]
*  It's a practical matter. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3332.9s)]
*  Putting aside words, as a practical matter, you're for Iran. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3335.9s)]
*  Just have the guts to say so. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3339.9s)]
*  Just have the guts to say so. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3344.9s)]
*  Now, Ted Cruz is a great man, great patriot. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3349.9s)]
*  I've known him for decades. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3358.9s)]
*  What you see is what you get. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3360.9s)]
*  He hasn't gone from being a liberal to a libertarian to a neocon to a conservative [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3362.9s)]
*  and an isolationist. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3368.9s)]
*  His head is screwed on tight. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3369.9s)]
*  His head is screwed on tight. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3373.9s)]
*  I'm going to play for you a little bit later a few short clips of him and Katarlson, Chatsworth [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3374.9s)]
*  Katarlson. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3381.9s)]
*  I noticed over at MediEye, they took a Katarlson clip because Katarlson was trying to get in [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3383.9s)]
*  front of this disaster where Cruz ripped him a new one and twisted it with a headline. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3391.9s)]
*  Questions being, how many people live in Iran? [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3400.9s)]
*  Why does that matter? [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3403.9s)]
*  You're a senator and you don't even know? [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3405.9s)]
*  What's the ethnic makeup of Iran? [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3407.9s)]
*  You know, Shia and that. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3410.9s)]
*  You don't know and you're a senator? [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3411.9s)]
*  That's the kind of stupidity. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3413.9s)]
*  And MediEye thought that was great. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3416.9s)]
*  Why? [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3418.9s)]
*  Because MediEye is in the camp of the isolationists. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3419.9s)]
*  Anything to attack Trump or to attack conservatives, they are in the camp of the isolationists. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3421.9s)]
*  We tried to get one of the gentlemen on this program. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3427.9s)]
*  What's his name again? [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3430.9s)]
*  Rich. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3431.9s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3432.9s)]
*  Colby Hall. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3433.9s)]
*  I was going to have a professional discussion with him, as I told you yesterday. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3434.9s)]
*  I wanted to ask him, what is your mission? [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3438.9s)]
*  I'm just curious. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3440.9s)]
*  What do you do? [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3441.9s)]
*  These hyper ridiculous headlines that are aimed at getting clicks. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3442.9s)]
*  These distorted stories. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3448.9s)]
*  I see your staff. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3450.9s)]
*  We've taken a little look at some of their backgrounds in the public record. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3451.9s)]
*  Mostly are hardcore leftists. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3454.9s)]
*  White male hardcore leftists. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3457.9s)]
*  What is your mission? [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3460.9s)]
*  How are you any different than media matters? [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3462.9s)]
*  But he wouldn't come on. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3465.9s)]
*  We tried to get the reporter for Politico, who lied about me. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3470.9s)]
*  She wouldn't answer. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3474.9s)]
*  We tried to get the reporter for the Independent. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3475.9s)]
*  She lied too. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3480.9s)]
*  She wouldn't come on. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3482.9s)]
*  We've tried to get the Marxist Islamists on this program. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3484.9s)]
*  They won't come on. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3487.9s)]
*  We've tried to get the Stalinists on this program. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3488.9s)]
*  They won't come on. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3490.9s)]
*  I don't need to debate other conservatives. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3493.9s)]
*  I mean, I don't mind. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3495.9s)]
*  But I don't need to give them a whoop ass. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3497.9s)]
*  That's not what I'm looking at. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3499.9s)]
*  I'm looking at these people who I believe undermine our nation. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3500.9s)]
*  But they won't come on. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3505.9s)]
*  They're safe, you see, behind their press people, behind their computers, and so forth and so on. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3508.9s)]
*  Mark Levin. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3514.9s)]
*  We're giving you nothing but the best, the best of Mark Levin. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3520.9s)]
*  You know, audience, this is going to be funny. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3527.9s)]
*  OK, reporters, turn on your recording devices. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3529.9s)]
*  See, the way it works here is whatever I say, they're going to try and create a fight between President Trump and me. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3533.9s)]
*  I promise, President Trump and I already know this. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3541.9s)]
*  The fact is, ladies and gentlemen, that whether it's two hours from now, two days from now, or two weeks from now, [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3548.9s)]
*  Iran's not going to go away on its own. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3556.9s)]
*  The Israelis are going to put it away by itself. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3561.9s)]
*  If they can, with that fraudulent nuclear site, they'll put it away with our assistance. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3566.9s)]
*  At some point, I suppose, or it's not going to go away. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3575.9s)]
*  It's not going to go away. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3581.9s)]
*  That's the truth. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3585.9s)]
*  You've got a combination of radical Democrats and fifth columnists, isolationists in this country, [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3586.9s)]
*  who actually have no, and I repeat, no idea how to deal with this, except, [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3595.9s)]
*  dig a hole and put your head in it and hope for the best. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3602.9s)]
*  If you don't take military action against Iran, then Iran exists. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3609.9s)]
*  If you don't take military action against Iran, then they will increase their ballistic missile inventory to the tens of thousands. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3615.9s)]
*  If you don't take military action against Tehran, they're going to have intercontinental ballistic missiles. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3624.9s)]
*  If you don't take military action against Iran, they're going to have nuclear warheads. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3630.9s)]
*  Combine that with their public statements, and you have a death threat against the American civilization and, of course, Israel. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3636.9s)]
*  Now, there's one lowlife out there who says Benjamin Netanyahu is the problem, that he's playing us. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3649.9s)]
*  And so I guess that means he's playing Donald Trump. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3655.9s)]
*  Donald Trump's not going to be played by anybody, and neither is Benjamin Netanyahu. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3659.9s)]
*  It's about time these people with a low IQ and a small vocabulary try and grow up and act like adults. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3663.9s)]
*  But they won't. They're stuck. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3675.9s)]
*  They've got their platforms, and that's the way it is. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3678.9s)]
*  Moreover, it is amazing to me that on an issue that is so clear between good and evil, that they're having a problem with their own morality. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3682.9s)]
*  One of them is so busy walking a fine line that everybody's lost respect for him. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3694.9s)]
*  Another one has effectively thrown in with the enemy, rarely ever condemning the Islamo-Nazi who runs Iran. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3704.9s)]
*  And despite the polls that are out, whether it's CNN, whether it is the Reagan Institute, all these major polls, [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3715.9s)]
*  although one site went to an online poll and tried to use that to support their position, it just shows you they have nothing, nothing, [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3723.9s)]
*  nothing substantive, nothing, no strategy, zero. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3733.9s)]
*  And for them, everything is Afghanistan and Iraq. They're ignoramuses. Everything is not Afghanistan and Iraq. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3738.9s)]
*  Everything is not nation building. This is called self-defense, peace, self-defense. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3744.9s)]
*  Iran struck Israel through its proxies. Iran has killed hundreds of Americans and maimed thousands. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3755.9s)]
*  They have blood, American blood on their hands. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3764.9s)]
*  Apparently, apparently this doesn't move, the fifth column isolationists. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3767.9s)]
*  Apparently, the Democrats are OK with this. In fact, they use their deaths to say, what do we want, more deaths? [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3773.9s)]
*  Iran, as the very perpetrator of those deaths, has been building nuclear weapons. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3780.9s)]
*  And they denied they were building nuclear weapons. And now Radcliffe, the head of the CIA, says they're on the one yard line. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3787.9s)]
*  It takes almost nothing for them to get a touchdown. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3794.9s)]
*  So we're supposed to disbelieve Radcliffe, disbelieve the IAEA, disbelieve the Austrians, disbelieve everybody, but believe them. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3797.9s)]
*  These are dangerous no-nothings. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3805.9s)]
*  Whether it's two weeks, next week, Saturday, Sunday, next Wednesday, this problem doesn't go away. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3813.9s)]
*  So we'll negotiate another two weeks. With whom, I don't know. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3828.9s)]
*  The Supreme Islamic Nazi, according to the press, we have all these quotes, has told us to screw off. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3835.9s)]
*  He's not interested. So I guess somebody else is going to negotiate. I don't know who. I don't know who they represent. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3844.9s)]
*  Could be interesting. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3854.9s)]
*  I don't know what kind of deal can be made. Unconditional surrender. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3859.9s)]
*  What's to negotiate? [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3867.9s)]
*  It's a three-word surrender, Mr. Producer. We surrender unconditionally. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3871.9s)]
*  Do you have to do a whole set of negotiations for that? Does that take two weeks? Does that take two minutes? [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3878.9s)]
*  I'm only basing my comments on what I'm reading in the newspaper and online and what people are saying who are supposed to be in the know. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3888.9s)]
*  Meanwhile, during this two-week period, ballistic missiles will continue to rain down on the Israeli people. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3902.9s)]
*  Yesterday, last evening, actually, they aimed one of those missiles at a hospital. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3909.9s)]
*  They said, oh, sorry, we were aiming at an intelligence facility. No, they weren't. They aimed it at a hospital. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3914.9s)]
*  And they hit it. A direct hit. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3920.9s)]
*  This is a hospital, one of the biggest in southern Israel that serves Muslims, Christians, Jews, Bedouins and Arabs, [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3924.9s)]
*  Druze, anybody who comes through the door, anybody. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3935.9s)]
*  And they hit it. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3942.9s)]
*  By the grace of God. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3947.9s)]
*  The part of the hospital that was hit by the grace of God. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3950.9s)]
*  The part of the hospital that was hit. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3955.9s)]
*  There was nobody there because they had moved the people out because they were doing work. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3959.9s)]
*  That's God's will. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3966.9s)]
*  What about the fact that Israel and the United States? This is known. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3971.9s)]
*  I'm not breaking any any rules are running out of interceptor missiles. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3976.9s)]
*  How much longer can that go on? [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3980.9s)]
*  How much longer can even a 90 percent or an 80 percent accuracy rate? [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3984.9s)]
*  With a 10 to 20 percent inaccuracy rate go on? [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3990.9s)]
*  I noticed that the Democrats and the fifth column isolationists rarely ever talk about the suffering of the Israeli people, [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=3997.9s)]
*  nor that they. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4006.9s)]
*  Nor do they condemn. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4009.9s)]
*  The supreme Islamist Nazi as much as they condemn Benjamin Netanyahu. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4012.9s)]
*  It's shocking what's going on. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4022.9s)]
*  Shocking. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4025.9s)]
*  And the level of Jew hatred and anti-Semitism promoted by by websites that continue to to give voice to these individuals who represent a tiny percentage of the people, [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4027.9s)]
*  whether it's media, the Drudge Report or some of the others is grotesque. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4038.9s)]
*  The people who go on on comment on that media platform and they own the platform. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4042.9s)]
*  Sound like Klansmen and neo-Nazis at just a disgrace. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4049.9s)]
*  But Dan Abrams has created over there. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4053.9s)]
*  A disgrace. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4056.9s)]
*  And then when they write articles, they dip into the comments section and they they trade pick comments that they feel will create the story that they're manufacturing. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4058.9s)]
*  And you wonder why people hate the press. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4070.9s)]
*  The fact is that you and I stand with eighty four percent of the Republicans. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4073.9s)]
*  You and I stand with 80 percent of the American people. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4082.9s)]
*  Real surveys. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4088.9s)]
*  Real polls, not you, Gov. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4091.9s)]
*  That's used by one of these websites to defend the indefensible. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4094.9s)]
*  Tell me where to go. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4099.9s)]
*  To find and I'll put a link up. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4102.9s)]
*  Tell me where to go to find the isolationist fifth column Democrat Party resolution to the Iran problem. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4105.9s)]
*  You can't find it. And not only that, they don't think it's a problem. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4115.9s)]
*  That's why the American people reject them, whether it's MAGA, the Tea Party, the Reagan Revolution, all of us. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4121.9s)]
*  The American people reject this. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4128.9s)]
*  So two weeks. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4137.9s)]
*  People will have the greatest deal in the history of humankind. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4140.9s)]
*  But when two weeks are up, if we don't. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4145.9s)]
*  Will the fifth column isolationists, will the Chatsworth, Katar, Olson's and his ilk. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4149.9s)]
*  Will they still oppose taking action? [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4158.9s)]
*  And what makes the next two the next two weeks so magical? [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4162.9s)]
*  What about the last three months? [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4165.9s)]
*  The fact is the Iranian regime is on its back. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4170.9s)]
*  It's hanging by its fingernails. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4174.9s)]
*  It's about to be eliminated. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4178.9s)]
*  And so so successful have the Israelis been. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4181.9s)]
*  And let's not play games. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4183.9s)]
*  The United States has provided some defensive support. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4185.9s)]
*  But those are Israelis going into Iran, attacking these locations. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4188.9s)]
*  That was Israeli intelligence taking out the highest levels of their military, taking out the top senior nuclear scientists. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4193.9s)]
*  They're the ones who are prepared to take out Khomeini. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4204.9s)]
*  They're the ones going after the nuclear sites. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4207.9s)]
*  They have no compunction about it all because they know that this is a battle between seventh century primitive barbarians, that regime, and the free world and modernity. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4209.9s)]
*  And whether we survive or they survive, they understand the mindset of the Islamists. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4221.9s)]
*  And Zoudi Jasser will be back next hour to explain it yet again. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4226.9s)]
*  So two weeks. OK, two weeks. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4235.9s)]
*  Two weeks. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4241.9s)]
*  And then can we assume the rubber hits the road? [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4244.9s)]
*  Or will the same reprobates, fifth column isolationists, gearing up for a fight, lobbying and pressuring and all the rest, will they be back at it? [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4248.9s)]
*  Yes, they will. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4259.9s)]
*  Because these people are ideologues. They're numbskulls. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4261.9s)]
*  They're dangerous. That's what they are. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4266.9s)]
*  And worse in some cases. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4271.9s)]
*  It's Nekunyahu's fault. Gee, we haven't heard that before. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4275.9s)]
*  It's the Israelis. It's their fault. Oh, OK. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4280.9s)]
*  It's the American warmongers and neocons. It's never the terrorists. Have you noticed? [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4283.9s)]
*  It's never the Iranian regime. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4289.9s)]
*  Just like Putin. It's never Putin. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4294.9s)]
*  It's Zelensky. Not Putin. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4297.9s)]
*  Zelensky. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4302.9s)]
*  The communist Chinese are watching this. The Russians are watching this. The North Koreans are watching this. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4305.9s)]
*  They're watching it. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4313.9s)]
*  And so far they're seeing the Israelis kicking the ass of the Iranian military. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4316.9s)]
*  It's defeated the Iranian military. Defeated it in 48 hours. That's what it did. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4321.9s)]
*  It defeated it. Now it's an issue of taking out all these nuclear sites. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4325.9s)]
*  And they're asking, I assume, I don't know firsthand, help on this Fordow or whatever it's called site. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4329.9s)]
*  They'll do whatever they can on their own. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4336.9s)]
*  They don't have the bunker buster and the bomber in order to deliver it. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4340.9s)]
*  Honestly, ladies and gentlemen, is that not the least we can do? Is that not the least we can do? [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4346.9s)]
*  They've been carrying the load here. They've carried the load with Hamas and Hezbollah. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4351.9s)]
*  They're carrying the load with Iran. Of course we're providing them with weapons. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4355.9s)]
*  Although they were denied in the last administration. Why wouldn't we? [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4359.9s)]
*  But it's their flesh and blood on the line. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4364.9s)]
*  Well, it's not our problem. How stupid. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4367.9s)]
*  Over and over again, intercontinental ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4372.9s)]
*  Do these people really? You know who they sound like? [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4378.9s)]
*  They sound like the primitive barbarians that run Iran. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4381.9s)]
*  They're slow learners. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4386.9s)]
*  Worse of all, they're ideologues. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZDjkZIOdw&t=4388.9s)]
