Video Description: On Tuesday’s Mark Levin Show, peace is not mere avoidance of conflict but a state secured through strength and decisive action against threats like Iran’s nuclear ambitions. No great president—Washington, Lincoln, Reagan, or Trump—would tolerate such dangers. "America First" prioritizes national security and global stability, not isolationism. It demands pragmatic, not ideological, foreign policy, assessing each threat uniquely. Labeling prudent action as "pro-war" is a misnomer; opposing nuclear-armed terrorists is pro-American.  A Kamala Harris presidency, aligning with appeasement, would weaken America and allies like Israel. Trump’s leadership, grounded in common sense, rejects endless wars but never shies from necessary action. Also, Israel has a right to live in a free society. These attacks from Iran, ongoing for years and escalating since October 7th, force Israelis to live in constant fear, with frequent sirens driving families to seek shelter in protective rooms or basements multiple times a day. This relentless situation disrupts normal life, preventing children from playing in parks or attending school regularly, and could cause significant psychological strain. Later, some members of Congress, mostly Democrats and a few Republicans, are attempting to undermine the President’s authority as Commander-in-Chief by citing the War Powers Act of 1973. This law is unconstitutional, as it shifts power from the President to Congress, contradicting the Constitution’s design. The President, it asserts, holds sole authority over military decisions, while Congress’s role is limited to declaring war and controlling funding.  Afterward, Sean Hannity calls in to discuss the Israel/Iran war.  Hannity explains that Trump’s leadership is defined by common-sense principles, particularly his consistent stance since 2011 that Iran must never acquire nuclear weapons. He contrasts this with misguided isolationism, asserting that preventing a nuclear-armed Iran is critical to global security.

# America First: What Does It Truly Mean?
**The Mark Levin Show:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g)
*  Ladies and gentlemen, this next segment of the podcast is brought to you by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=0.0s)]
*  For over 50 years, the Great Heritage Foundation has been America's outpost in Washington, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4.8s)]
*  fighting against the D.C. federal bureaucracy and working to secure a future that allows Americans [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=9.52s)]
*  to live the good life. For too long, common sense principles have been ignored by many of the very [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=14.64s)]
*  leaders claiming to fight for America, but the Heritage Foundation is proud to hold our leaders [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=19.28s)]
*  accountable and stand up for America's founding principles, paid for by the Heritage Foundation. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=23.6s)]
*  He's here. Now, broadcasting from the underground command post, deep in the bowels of a hidden [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=30.48s)]
*  bunker, somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=38.0s)]
*  we once again make contact with our leader, Mark LeVein. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=42.56s)]
*  Hello, America. Mark LeVein here, our number 877-381-3811, 877-381-3811. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=120.88s)]
*  What is peace? What is America first? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=135.04s)]
*  Who decides? Who's pro-war? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=142.72s)]
*  You know, we'd have a different, very different world today if Kamala Harris were president. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=146.08s)]
*  She'd be agreeing with Bernie Sanders. She'd be agreeing with Chadworth Katarlson. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  In other words, it would be Iran pretty much free to do whatever it wants, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=165.68s)]
*  Iran pretty much free to do whatever it wants, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=172.32s)]
*  and Israel having to sit there, and the United States having to sit there. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=175.76s)]
*  I can't think of a great president of the United States who would ever have done that. Not one. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=182.56s)]
*  Washington? Lincoln? Not one. Reagan? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=190.08s)]
*  And Donald Trump is one of the greatest presidents in American history. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=196.32s)]
*  I've told you over and over again over the years, Donald Trump is not an isolationist. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=205.84s)]
*  He's never even used that word to define who and what he is or believes. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  He's not an appeaser. He's not a pacifist. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=219.28s)]
*  Foreign policy is about what? What have I written and what have we discussed here? It's not about [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  ideology. Never wars, quote unquote. Forever wars, quote unquote. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=231.44s)]
*  Always unexplained, and yet apparently in every circumstance it applies. But it can't. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=239.68s)]
*  Every circumstance is different. Different countries, different threats. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=247.44s)]
*  Foreign policy should be looked at not as an ideological matter. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=251.84s)]
*  That could kill you. As a prudential matter, as President Trump calls it, common sense. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=257.2s)]
*  You look at the facts, you look at the countries you're dealing with, our experience with them, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=263.28s)]
*  the world's experience with them, and you apply our principles. Our principles. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=269.36s)]
*  So what is peace when we're dealing with Iran like this? What is peace? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=275.92s)]
*  Now you know that peace is not isolationism when a country keeps threatening to destroy you, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=284.16s)]
*  tries to assassinate our president. Is hell bent on having nuclear weapons and building tens of [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=290.96000000000004s)]
*  thousands of ballistic missiles? We don't have an iron shield. We don't have a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=297.36s)]
*  Tens of thousands of ballistic missiles. We don't have an iron shield. We don't have any [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=301.6s)]
*  defensive system sufficient enough to stop any of this. Some of it, but not enough of it. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=305.28000000000003s)]
*  If we had ballistic missiles raining down on our major cities, you know what we would do about it. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=312.08000000000004s)]
*  And you know quite well that if any country within our hemisphere, let alone on our border, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=318.32000000000005s)]
*  was developing nuclear missiles, that is nuclear warheads and missiles to fire them at us, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=325.52s)]
*  we wouldn't tolerate that. So why is it that when it comes to the state of Israel, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=331.91999999999996s)]
*  they're expected to tolerate it? And why is it that when it comes to us, we should tolerate it? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=339.59999999999997s)]
*  Is that America first? That's never been America first. Are there any interpretation or definition [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=345.59999999999997s)]
*  or definition of America first? Because it's not. Two simple words, America first. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=354.08000000000004s)]
*  Our enemies would love this. They do love it. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=361.20000000000005s)]
*  And who gets to decide? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=368.24s)]
*  The isolationist radicals, they want you to believe that Donald Trump has [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=372.40000000000003s)]
*  deceived you, that he's defied his own statements. We've heard some of this from people in some of [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=378.64000000000004s)]
*  our friendliest platforms. The problem is them. That's their position. It's never been Donald [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=383.44s)]
*  Trump's position. He's never conducted himself that way. You see, there's some confusion out [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=393.28s)]
*  there and it's intentional. That if you're prudent with the use of military force, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=401.2s)]
*  use it as a last resort, but nonetheless feel the trigger needs to be pulled, you're a warmonger. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=407.84s)]
*  Over a mediaite, some guy wrote, Mark's pro-war. I'm not pro-war. I'm anti-terrorists with nuclear [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=413.44s)]
*  weapons who keep saying they're going to use it against us. That's not pro-war. That's pro-American. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=420.96s)]
*  I tried to have the gentleman come on the program tonight. He refused. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=427.6s)]
*  Kobe Howell over at the mediaite. He's the big guy there. He said he didn't want to be insulted [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=432.08s)]
*  and so forth. And so I looked, Kobe, I'll tell you what, you weren't going to be insulted. I wanted [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=437.6s)]
*  to have a real discussion. I don't understand what you do at mediaite. All of you. I don't [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=441.76s)]
*  understand why you have these hyper dishonest headlines. I don't understand your mission. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=446.32s)]
*  And I wanted you to explain it to the American people because I see little [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=454.64s)]
*  distance between you and media matters. And is that what you're about? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=460.88s)]
*  You're about aggregating things, slapping crazy titles on them. And certainly from center, center, left [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=464.64s)]
*  or left. And I don't understand why you're an apologist for these extremists, effectively. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=474.47999999999996s)]
*  When you give a description of Chatsworth Cotarrelson and you leave out completely his [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=481.76s)]
*  anti-Semitism and his promotion of anti-Semites, that's wrong. But you didn't want to have that [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=486.47999999999996s)]
*  discussion. It would have been a very professional discussion. No name, calling, no insults. I had my [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=492.56s)]
*  producer tell you that. I hope you'll rethink this. I really do. These guys can't do enough stories with [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=496.96s)]
*  me in them. And then every year they put out a list, most influential media figures, right, Mr. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=506.16s)]
*  Reducer? Well, if I'm not on your list of 65, why do you keep talking about me, writing about me, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=510.96s)]
*  and reporting about me? Don't you think that's kind of dishonest? I should be right at the top [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=517.36s)]
*  of your stupid list, but it doesn't matter. The vast majority of America doesn't know what [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=522.0s)]
*  mediality is if I don't mention it. But it's part and parcel of the problem. We have this [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=527.04s)]
*  site called Axios, which is quite left. And they have a reporter there, Barack Ravine. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=532.32s)]
*  And he used to be the go-to guy for the Biden administration, for the Biden [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=539.68s)]
*  State Department, them and Politico and a few others, where basically they're scribes for people [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=544.08s)]
*  who leaked to them. And in the Trump presidency, the isolationists are leaking like hell. They're [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=550.32s)]
*  relentless. It's almost every day to him, mostly to him. And all these stories, the president denies [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=560.48s)]
*  them. Other people deny them, trying to show a terrible rift between Israel and the president [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=566.72s)]
*  or the United States and on and on and on. And the president put out a statement today [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=572.48s)]
*  saying what they had was false. And there are reports, as I surmised, about who's involved, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=576.48s)]
*  which offices are involved. But I'm going to keep my powder dry until there's a little bit more meat [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=585.0400000000001s)]
*  on that bone. But it is as I expected. I don't leak to the media, by the way, as a footnote. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=591.2800000000001s)]
*  You can ask the media. I don't. If I have something to say, I'll say it on the record. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=602.72s)]
*  I don't talk a lot to the media. Conservative media, sure. But I'm talking about the corporate [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=609.84s)]
*  media. Why should I? I have a radio show, a TV show, I have a digital show. I can talk to you [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=616.4s)]
*  directly. And I don't believe what I say will be reported accurately anyway. I've spent tens of [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=622.4s)]
*  thousands of hours behind this microphone explaining my views in great detail. I've written [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=631.36s)]
*  10 bestselling books with thousands of notes on the back footnotes and endnotes. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=637.36s)]
*  And this is what I want to discuss from the guy from MediEight. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=644.72s)]
*  Why is it that you never report about these things? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=647.76s)]
*  You really want to know my view. They're spelled out in exquisite detail over the course of over [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=652.0799999999999s)]
*  two decades. My views are not a secret. I'm here today to express them, to explain them, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=657.12s)]
*  if necessary, to defend them or alter them. Donald Trump has explained what America First means, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=666.88s)]
*  and we have really, really outliers, some of whom I think have serious psychological issues. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=678.24s)]
*  Who insist that they get to define or insist on projecting onto Donald Trump what their views are, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=687.28s)]
*  even though Donald Trump has never embraced them. Of course, he's embraced their support, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=694.48s)]
*  needs votes, but he's never embraced their views. I told you this and I've told you this over and [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=698.48s)]
*  over again. Just to keep throwing the word around, peace, peace, peace, doesn't make it so, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=704.08s)]
*  nor does it mean the people who keep using it are for peace or have any idea what peace is about. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=713.92s)]
*  If you have a guy next door, and he keeps telling you he wants to kill you, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=722.16s)]
*  and he supports and funds individuals who've killed family members of yours, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=729.52s)]
*  and he's telling you he wants to get a weapon strong enough to blow your house up, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=737.68s)]
*  you just sit there and say, peace means just sitting on my ass and watching this and listening [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=743.92s)]
*  to that. Of course not. That's not peace. Iran with nuclear weapons, now ballistic missiles, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=748.4s)]
*  we've learned about, that's not peace. The question is, how do you ensure peace? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=757.68s)]
*  How do you ensure that the United States is never hit by these weapons? You're talking about a [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=763.4399999999999s)]
*  seventh century barbarian police state, a primitive regime that believes their God [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=768.16s)]
*  requires them to kill us, as you'll learn when you read my book on power. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=785.1999999999999s)]

*  Now where this keeps up, ladies and gentlemen, the issue shouldn't be will we get involved to help [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2344.96s)]
*  Israel. The issue should be will we get involved to help ourselves for God's sakes. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2353.92s)]
*  Even the nature of the discussion is absurd. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2361.44s)]
*  Amir Kozak is a comedian. Now unlike the isolationist comedians who claim to be historians [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2364.48s)]
*  and are clearly anti-Semites, he's none of those things. He's a comedian. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2372.88s)]
*  He does a little bit on the moral clarity and insight of Chatsworth [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2382.72s)]
*  Katarlson. He does a good imitation, I thought. I think it's time for a little bit of levity, don't you? [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2390.5600000000004s)]
*  So here it is. Listen up, turn up the volume, have a good laugh, go. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2401.36s)]
*  How do you feel about Israel versus the Iranian regime? [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2405.2000000000003s)]
*  I mean, I've always said that the Iranian regime is evil and needs to be destroyed, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2407.6800000000003s)]
*  there's no question. What I think they're doing now, [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2412.7200000000003s)]
*  and what I think they're doing now, Israel at least, is what they're doing is appalling. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2416.88s)]
*  What? [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2421.92s)]
*  I certainly don't want to be involved in it, but what are we doing? [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2423.6000000000004s)]
*  And so I mean, I have no ill will against anyone. I don't hate anyone. I have no biases. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2431.76s)]
*  All of mine are out in the open. I just feel that, you know, I don't hate anyone. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2438.88s)]
*  I have no animus towards anyone, but I certainly despise Ben Shapiro, [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2444.16s)]
*  Daily Wire, the Neocons, Mark Dubowicz, Mark Levin, all my old colleagues at Fox, my old self. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2449.36s)]
*  Your old self? [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2457.04s)]
*  Yes, I hate my old self. I hate myself completely. I hate myself yesterday. I love myself today. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2458.3199999999997s)]
*  I don't know how I'll feel about myself tomorrow, but that's my business. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2463.52s)]
*  Who knows how they're going to feel about themselves? [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2469.2799999999997s)]
*  When I look in the mirror, I don't even know who that is, actually. I don't know what I'm seeing. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2471.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't know who you are. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2477.28s)]
*  What? [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2478.32s)]
*  Are we in a simulation? It certainly feels that way. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2478.8s)]
*  A simulation. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2481.36s)]
*  And I love it, but I also despise it. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2482.1600000000003s)]
*  And? [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2485.6000000000004s)]
*  I'm sorry, this doesn't make any sense. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2486.1600000000003s)]
*  And I'm sorry, but who are you to tell me that I'm incoherent? [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2487.76s)]
*  But you are being very incoherent. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2491.6000000000004s)]
*  I know, I know. It's working. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2495.04s)]
*  So who do you want to win? [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2498.0s)]
*  Russia. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2499.28s)]
*  Russia? What? [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2500.16s)]
*  Oh. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2503.92s)]
*  Look, people imitate me all the time. It's funny, but this is funny and very realistic, I think. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2511.12s)]
*  Very good comedian, Ami Kozak. We will post this for your entertainment. I think we did already. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2518.96s)]
*  Should you be interested in taking a listen? [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2526.24s)]
*  President of the United States says, no ceasefire. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2530.64s)]
*  Can you folks tell me how many times in war, when a country is losing, [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2533.8399999999997s)]
*  you can call for a ceasefire or you can get other countries to pressure [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2542.48s)]
*  a country to pressure the winning country, the country that's winning, to stop? [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2548.08s)]
*  Like this is some kind of baseball game? [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2553.8399999999997s)]
*  Those of us who don't want forever wars, this is the problem. That creates a forever war, doesn't it? [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2555.6s)]
*  This is an enemy that needs to be fundamentally and utterly defeated, [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2562.7999999999997s)]
*  whether Tulsi Gabbard likes it or not. And that's what we did with the Japanese. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2566.72s)]
*  That's what we did with Germany. That's what we did with Italy. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2571.36s)]
*  The greatest generation. It wasn't a forever war. It lasted four, four and a half years. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2575.8399999999997s)]
*  And that was that. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2581.7599999999998s)]
*  Should we learn from that experience? [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2583.12s)]
*  You don't have a terrorist regime that threatens to destroy your people, [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2588.96s)]
*  caught red-handed trying to murder our president. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2597.92s)]
*  You've got them on their back. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2603.04s)]
*  The Israelis have them on their back. The Israelis have done this with support from us. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2606.32s)]
*  But they're the point of the spear. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2613.44s)]
*  They're the ones that have to deal with the ballistic missiles and so forth and so on. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2616.7999999999997s)]
*  Have an opportunity like this where after all this time the Israelis control the air. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2622.88s)]
*  They've taken out most of the senior military personnel. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2628.0s)]
*  Khomeini's hiding, wetting his depends in his robe. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2633.68s)]
*  And then say, you know what, time out, time out. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2636.72s)]
*  And then we get the question, well, what happens afterwards? Chaos will ensue. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2645.3599999999997s)]
*  This is just asinine. Nobody knows what's going to happen afterwards. We're not creating [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2654.64s)]
*  a democracy project. That's the point. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2661.3599999999997s)]
*  But the Iranian people, more specifically the Persians, they will decide what they want. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2663.36s)]
*  You know, when you're fighting a war, it's not hermetically sealed. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2673.1200000000003s)]
*  You don't know every consequence that's going to result. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2679.6800000000003s)]
*  But there are consequences that will result that are more important than anything else, like [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2683.76s)]
*  destroying a regime that wants to destroy you with nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2688.7200000000003s)]
*  That is righteous. What the Israelis are doing is righteous. What the Israelis are doing, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2693.3599999999997s)]
*  the entire world will benefit from. The entire world. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2699.6s)]
*  Now we have members of Congress who are working hard to undermine the Commander in Chief. We have [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2707.3599999999997s)]
*  members of Congress who are trying to prevent Israel and hence the West from defeating [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2713.8399999999997s)]
*  the primitives from the seventh century. They are Democrats and a handful of Republicans. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2720.32s)]
*  They are dishonorable. They try to cloak themselves in the language of the Constitution. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2729.36s)]
*  They are grotesque, actually. I've gone through this discussion before. I just went and looked, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2738.4s)]
*  Mr. Bidusher. I've dealt with the War Powers Act before, have I not? [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2745.76s)]
*  Folks, you can go online and you can see my comments before. See, there's a treaty clause [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2750.88s)]
*  of the Constitution, which I strongly support. It's cut and dry. It's clear. We know the whole [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2755.2000000000003s)]
*  history behind it. It's in the Constitution. That if there had been or is some kind of a deal, [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2759.6000000000004s)]
*  to me, it should go to Congress. Specifically, it should go to the Senate under the treaty provision. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2767.36s)]
*  But we have provisions in our Constitution. The President of the United States, the Commander in [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2772.88s)]
*  Chief, now when you look at Madison's notes and you understand the debate that took place, [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2776.88s)]
*  they said one person needs to be in charge of war. One. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2781.84s)]
*  So they created the President of the United States. They said he's the Commander in Chief. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2788.88s)]
*  There was debate about Congress's participation. There was debate on whether Congress had to [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2792.7200000000003s)]
*  be part of the military decision making. They decided, no, it's just too unruly. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2798.96s)]
*  And plus, if you have an urgency, it'll never get addressed. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2804.56s)]
*  There's also a declaration of war provision in the Constitution, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2810.56s)]
*  where Congress passes declaration of wars, typically at the request of the Commander in [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2815.52s)]
*  Chief. So you have the declaration of war provision and you have the Commander in Chief provision. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2821.04s)]
*  Where is there any authority whatsoever for Congress to pass the War Powers Act? [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2827.92s)]
*  Limiting the power of the President? Well, Mark, is he a king? And then people start to sound like [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2831.92s)]
*  all the Marxist Islamists out there. Well, there's a third provision of the Constitution. What is that? [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2838.0s)]
*  It's the spending clause. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2845.76s)]
*  Congress has the power to deny funds, if it wishes, for any military action. Not even, [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2850.08s)]
*  it doesn't have to be limited to a full blown war. And Congress has done that before. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2859.44s)]
*  That's how we eventually lost in Vietnam. Congress cut off the funds by a veto-proof majority. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2866.16s)]
*  Gerald Ford vetoed it and he lost. Then we had the boat people and all the other horrors had [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2871.6s)]
*  followed from that. But Congress exercised its spending clause power. That is the check on the [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2877.2s)]
*  President, not the War Powers Act. They can't pass a statute and say, look at us, we've amended [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2884.72s)]
*  the Constitution. I don't care what any court says, let alone the Supreme Court. I don't even [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2890.3999999999996s)]
*  believe it's been fully challenged in that regard. So now we have the so-called Tom Massey, Mr. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2894.24s)]
*  Constitution, waving around the War Powers Act. I'm guessing Mike Lee will get in on it. Some of [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2900.9599999999996s)]
*  the others, Rand Paul. Look at this, we have a War Powers Act, 1973. That's right, 1973. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2906.3999999999996s)]
*  It's not in the Constitution. You can't alter the balance of power and the various authorities [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2915.12s)]
*  given to one branch or another with a statute, whether you want to or not, whether you claim to [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2921.04s)]
*  be a constitutionalist or not. And so the use of the War Powers Act is nothing more than to try and [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2926.08s)]
*  prevent Donald Trump, who's been very judicious, very prudential, very careful about what he's doing. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2934.3999999999996s)]
*  To take steps. Now, now, if should he choose to do so, to help destroy these nuclear programs, [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2945.4399999999996s)]
*  these nuclear sites. You're going to sit around and wait till what? Are they on vacation? I don't [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2955.12s)]
*  even know. They can't even get a damn budget with tax cuts passed. We want power over war. You don't [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2960.08s)]
*  get power over this. We have the right to declare war. You do. But your power to, [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2965.3599999999997s)]
*  quote unquote, challenge a war or end the war is the power of the purse, [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2974.64s)]
*  not the power of declaration. The declaration is an affirmative act. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2980.96s)]
*  And every military campaign is not a full on war. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2987.04s)]
*  It's not a full on war. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2993.7599999999998s)]
*  So now they're going to cite what is an illegitimate statute, an unconstitutional statute [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=2997.68s)]
*  that steals power from the commander in chief, gives it to Congress while these clowns sit on [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3002.32s)]
*  their ass and debate what? Unlike the treaty provision, which is quite specific. Quite specific. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3007.92s)]
*  And so these radical libertarians, these isolationists, throwing in with the [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3024.2400000000002s)]
*  Democrats like Tlaib and Omar and the rest of the hate America crowd, all they're trying to do is [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3031.12s)]
*  obstruct, undermine, handicap. Because if the president of the United States was truly bound [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3038.72s)]
*  by every decision when it comes to national security that involves a battle or more than one battle [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3045.92s)]
*  to get approval from Congress, then we'd never be safe, ever. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3053.12s)]
*  And then the whole point of a commander in chief would be irrelevant, utterly irrelevant. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3060.0s)]
*  The framers didn't say we have a commander in chief and hopefully one day they'll pass a [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3066.0s)]
*  war powers act to limit him. It doesn't say that. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3070.0s)]
*  Congress shall declare war. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3076.0s)]
*  But every military campaign is not a war. It's not a full on war. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3080.4s)]
*  I'm sorry if people are upset about this. That's the way it is. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3089.84s)]
*  It's now we have, you know, the Marxists trying to seize power from the president through their [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3097.92s)]
*  courts. Now we have the radical libertarian isolationists throwing in with Bernie Sanders [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3104.8s)]
*  and AOC and Daniel C. trying to undermine and seize power from the power of the presidency. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3113.52s)]
*  So my advice to Mr. Massey, my advice to Mr. Paul and Manny Melon, Jack [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3123.12s)]
*  and the Marx brothers and everybody else in Congress, [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3131.44s)]
*  stop pissing up the wrong tree. If you think you can really stop the president [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3136.64s)]
*  and you really want to stop the president, then use the power of the purse. Here's their problem. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3142.0s)]
*  The president has to sign it and they don't have a veto proof number on this. So they want to skirt [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3148.7200000000003s)]
*  it. That's why I'm just being honest with you. They want to accuse him of you violated the war [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3153.6s)]
*  powers act, which he should. By the way, every president should, in my humble opinion. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3159.04s)]
*  This is another straw man, another fig leaf to what they really intend here. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3166.72s)]
*  Now, can you remember, ladies and gentlemen, the last time we've discussed the war powers act, [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3172.32s)]
*  the worst power act? Can you? It's not under a Democrat, is it? [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3176.16s)]
*  We were funding Ukraine. Did that require the triggering of the wars power act? [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3188.32s)]
*  Did that require the triggering of the wars power act? If it did, I didn't hear anybody talk about [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3193.44s)]
*  it. Did you? Unlike most people, I guess. I support supporting Ukraine. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3197.52s)]
*  That's not my question. Whether you support Ukraine or not, or whether you. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3210.88s)]
*  I mean, unbelievably support Putin. That's not my question. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3217.76s)]
*  You never heard anybody talk about the war powers act on the Democrat side. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3223.12s)]
*  I don't remember Massie talking about, maybe he did. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3227.12s)]
*  But he's such a irrelevant squeak when he speaks, it doesn't really matter. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3231.76s)]
*  I'll be right back. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3236.88s)]

*  There is no authority, none, none in the Constitution for Congress to interfere with [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3317.52s)]
*  actions this president may take to knock out these nuclear sites [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3326.64s)]
*  other than the spending clause of the Constitution. So why doesn't Congress go there? Because they [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3332.0s)]
*  don't have the votes. They may have a vote for a majority but they don't have a vote for an override [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3337.76s)]
*  because the president would surely override a vote. They don't have the super majority number. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3343.36s)]
*  So what does Massey do and what are the others doing? They're trying to use this War Powers Act [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3349.76s)]
*  that was passed as a statute in 1973. Now if they wanted to change the way they were doing it, [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3354.16s)]
*  now if they wanted to change the way things work, how come they didn't go for a constitutional [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3360.0s)]
*  amendment because they don't have the votes and they wanted the support of the state legislatures. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3364.0s)]
*  So they're acting like Marxist Islamists, aren't they? Going around the system while raving around [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3369.12s)]
*  the Constitution. So what's a declaration of war? Declaration of war means and has historically meant [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3374.0s)]
*  that only Congress has the power to declare war. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3385.36s)]
*  Now when you're trying to knock out nuclear sites in Iranian country, [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3390.0s)]
*  that's not a full-on war. We're not even sending infantry over there. We're not sending tanks over [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3394.48s)]
*  there. We have bunker buster bombs and so forth and so on. The Israelis are fighting the war. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3400.32s)]
*  And so this is to be semantical. I'm talking about traditionally, historically, precedentially [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3412.16s)]
*  how this nation has conducted itself when it comes to war. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3417.44s)]
*  For example, if we decided that we're going to have a full-out war against Communist China, [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3424.2400000000002s)]
*  we would need a declaration of war against Communist China. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3429.6800000000003s)]
*  A full-out war against the Islamist regime in Iran. We've had anything but that. We've had an [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3435.12s)]
*  we've had an incredibly restrained commander-in-chief. Brilliant, brilliant strategy right up to this point, too. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3441.52s)]
*  We don't have a full-out war and we're not going to have a full-out war against Iran. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3453.8399999999997s)]
*  And so these are obstacles being thrown up to undermine our military, to undermine the [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3460.64s)]
*  commander-in-chief, to undermine the state of Israel. And believe it or not, Tom Massey and his [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3467.2s)]
*  ilk can dress up what they're doing as a constitutional issue, but it's not. They're [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3475.12s)]
*  siding with the Islamist Nazi regime that wants to blow us off the face of the earth. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3482.3999999999996s)]
*  And so are these phony isolationists. I'll be right back. Pure Talk, my wireless company, [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3487.6s)]

*  He is the MAGA movement. And, you know, I tell people, people will ask me a lot of times, [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3651.36s)]

*  ridiculous idea that isolationism is America first. It is not. What is at the heart of [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3694.08s)]
*  the MAGA movement? Trump says it in every speech. It's really common sense. And common sense when [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3702.96s)]
*  it comes to a nuclear armed Iran is self evident. It's not anything. It's not that deep. Now people [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3710.64s)]
*  say, well, wait a minute, we got involved in Iraq and Afghanistan and it became a long drawn out, [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3718.8799999999997s)]
*  you know, conflict. Well, if you look at if we, if we were to call something the Trump doctrine, [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3726.4s)]
*  the Trump doctrine that has emerged in, in this moment is that something that he said, [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3732.24s)]
*  and I traced it back the first time I could find that he first said Iran can never have nukes was [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3738.88s)]
*  2011 Mark Levin. 2011. I'm going to show this on TV tonight. And he has said it often many times [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3744.4s)]
*  since when I was with him in Saudi Arabia, in Qatar, Qatar, depending on how you like to say it, [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3753.6800000000003s)]
*  when I was with him in the UAE Abu Dhabi, you would have loved it there. But they would have loved me [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3759.92s)]

*  No, there really was. There was there was a cultural center that had all of the world's [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3776.08s)]
*  religions, including a Jewish temple. It was actually probably one of them. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3781.12s)]
*  Were there any Jews in there? Yeah, there were. Okay. Would you bring them with you on the plane? [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3786.16s)]
*  Go ahead. I'm sorry. Mark, Mark, stop. I lost my old trend of thought. I have no idea. But, [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3792.88s)]
*  so what the president is saying and has said consistently throughout his life and career, [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3802.56s)]
*  and has not wavered because it is common sense. Common sense is the heart of Donald Trump and his [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3809.04s)]
*  instincts. And that is the Trump doctrine that has emerged is Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3815.84s)]
*  It defies all common sense. If you don't see the danger, when the number one state sponsor of terror [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3824.32s)]
*  that has repeatedly said they're going to wipe Israel off the map, wipe America off the map, [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3833.04s)]
*  the little Satan, the great Satan, you know, I've raised this question with my audience. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3839.52s)]
*  And we all went through we all went through 9-11-01. We lost 2,977 Americans that day. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3845.36s)]
*  And we lost many more since from 9-11 related illness as well. So, but we lost 2,977. You [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3854.56s)]
*  extrapolate out the population in Israel on October the 7th. That would be the equivalent of 40,000 [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3862.96s)]
*  dead Americans in a day. I'm not really sure what part of murder and rape and kidnapping [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3869.52s)]
*  and torture and beheading the left in this country doesn't quite understand. You know, [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3876.48s)]
*  how many rockets would it take fired into an American town or an American city before Americans [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3883.52s)]
*  rightly demanded that their government respond? Because I've been to Israel a number of times. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3891.84s)]
*  You've been to Israel a number of times. I was shocked. You know, I was at the wall in Israel and [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3898.8s)]
*  I couldn't believe a mob formed around me. People knew me, watched me, listened to me. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3904.4s)]
*  And I was kind of blown away by it and very touched by it because they know that I support Israel. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3909.84s)]
*  And I do so proudly. And it was it was just an amazing experience. But this country, Mark, [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3916.6400000000003s)]
*  has had to withstand hundreds of thousands of rockets. The vast majority of those rockets [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3926.08s)]
*  provided funded by this terror regime, or as you call it, this Nazi regime out of Iran. They have [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3934.72s)]
*  been funding Hamas. They helped plan with the Quds forces, Iranian Revolutionary Guard forces, [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3943.04s)]
*  October 7. They they fund in Lebanon, Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad. They have been providing [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3949.12s)]
*  weaponry to the Houthi rebels out of Yemen. They also you can include the Iraqi militia, [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3957.92s)]
*  the Syrian militia. Now they're firing the most powerful ballistic missiles they've ever had. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3963.2s)]
*  Literally, you know, hundreds and hundreds at a time, wave after wave after wave. It's a miracle. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3970.0s)]
*  There hasn't been more death and destruction. The Iron Dome, which I have seen in action up close [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3976.56s)]
*  and personal and I've been in the tunnels. And I went to one border town, Mark, that border town [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3982.64s)]
*  is called Sordot. You can see Gaza with the naked eye. That poor town when I'd gone there the last [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3988.0s)]
*  time was hit with 10,000 rockets. I went there on one day, I came back the next day. And a kibbutz, [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=3993.92s)]
*  which is a neighborhood had been hit the night before by a massive rocket. Now I went to the [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4001.6s)]
*  back of the police station and they literally had the years of the rockets that they've been able [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4007.44s)]
*  to recover and the level of progression in terms of the lethality of it all. And it's they're all [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4012.72s)]
*  designed for maximum human damage and death. Now, if they fired one rocket, let's say they fired it [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4020.48s)]
*  into Oklahoma or Florida, the end of them. America would demand it. Let me put it to you this way. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4028.8s)]
*  We almost went to war with Russia under Khrushchev when they were putting when they were they brought [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4038.32s)]
*  ships in to put nuclear missiles in Cuba and they were forced to take them back and turn around. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4044.6400000000003s)]
*  We don't even allow a nuclear weapon anywhere in this hemisphere. We don't allow weapons [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4050.4s)]
*  anywhere in this hemisphere that could endanger America. And so that the and when you look at [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4055.04s)]
*  Israel, if a country that's shooting ballistic missiles into that country, they want atomic [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4061.92s)]
*  weapons, they nuclear weapons rather they they've slaughtered people in kibbutz. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4066.56s)]
*  But here's what gets me Sean, let me ask you about this before you have to go. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4072.0s)]
*  They took out an Israel who slaughtered American Marines, who also slaughtered American citizens [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4076.0s)]
*  in two embassies all backed by Iran. They have all but taken out Hamas, which is funding [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4081.52s)]
*  terror front groups in the United States of America, groups that have links to Hamas [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4088.8s)]
*  in the United States of America and so forth and so on. They are taking on the Iranians, [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4093.52s)]
*  the Iranians, which which obviously seek long distance intercontinental ballistic missiles with [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4099.36s)]
*  nuclear warheads on them. Is there a sane human being in the United States of America that doesn't [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4104.96s)]
*  root for Israel? How nuts do you have to be? A lot of nutty people, but I don't really care [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4111.28s)]
*  about them. I really don't, because they're not the ones that are in charge. And I'm going to [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4117.759999999999s)]
*  I'm going to backtrack a little bit here. They seem to think they are though, don't they? [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4123.92s)]
*  Well, a lot of people think they are in there. They're absolutely. Yeah, they're [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4128.88s)]
*  just cautiously there. Well, they're atrociously ignorant in my view. I don't get into the [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4133.5199999999995s)]
*  personality of it all, but I will I will tell you, you know what Joe Biden did. It's not just [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4139.6s)]
*  that they lied about his cognitive state. It's not that they lied about the economy and it was [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4147.360000000001s)]
*  inflation transitory. They allowed into this country somewhere between 12 and 20 million [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4152.160000000001s)]
*  unvetted illegals among them. Known terrorists. We have Iranian assassination squads. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4157.84s)]
*  Donald Trump had a duck and dodge and weave in the Secret Service go crazy trying to find them. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4165.76s)]
*  They still haven't found them. We have murderers, rapists. We have cartel members, gang members, [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4171.12s)]
*  other violent criminals and drug dealers that Joe Biden let in. And now Donald Trump has to [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4177.04s)]
*  get rid of them. Now, I have been saying that I always I always add I pray to God that I'm wrong, [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4182.0s)]
*  Mark. I don't think I'm going to be proven wrong, but I say it's a matter of when, not if those [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4187.68s)]
*  people that he and Mayorkas and Kamala Harris led into this country, there's going to be a lot more [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4195.04s)]
*  blood on their hands. They already have Lake and Riley's blood on their hands. They have Jocelyn [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4202.16s)]
*  Nungary's blood on their hands. They have Rachel Moran's blood on their hands. I used to scroll [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4207.04s)]
*  the names during the campaign. All the people murdered and raped and victims of violent crime, [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4212.56s)]
*  you know, and then you have this Democratic Party. They had the audacity during the joint [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4216.88s)]
*  session of Congress. They couldn't stand for the for the mothers that lost their children [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4221.12s)]
*  because of Biden and Harris and Mayorkas. And frankly, the complicit Democrats and complicit [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4226.16s)]
*  media that stood by, they either spread the lie that the border was closed and secure, [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4231.5199999999995s)]
*  or they stood by silently knowing damn well it was a the most preventable national security threat. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4237.2s)]
*  And they didn't sound the alarm. So I have no sympathy for these people. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4243.92s)]
*  Forever. Tell us, tell us who your guests are tonight on Fox. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4248.5599999999995s)]
*  Let me see. We have a really good guest on. Who is it? Oh, that's right. The great one. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4253.2s)]
*  You're on. We have Trey Yanks. He's in Tel Aviv. Boy, he's been doing great work. Yeah. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4258.48s)]
*  We have Ted Cruz on tonight. We have the majority leader Thune on tonight. And Aaron Cohn has been [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4265.5199999999995s)]
*  great. He's on tonight, too. By the way, the Israelis are launching new attacks against Iran [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4272.16s)]
*  as we speak. So Mark, one last point. There's a lot happening. There's going [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4277.68s)]
*  to be a lot happening in the next week. One last point. Should the president pull the [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4283.52s)]
*  trigger here if he does? I mean, we expect and I believe our fellow Americans are going to rally [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4287.84s)]
*  around the president, rally around our military, rally around our ally and their military Israel [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4293.280000000001s)]
*  against this diabolical evil, primitive enemy. Is that not the case? I'm sure it is. Yeah, [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4297.84s)]
*  we own this. Thanks to the Israelis. We own the skies over all of Iran. Do you realize [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4306.0s)]
*  if the Israelis or the U.S. and in a joint effort together, if they wanted to destroy their entire [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4312.88s)]
*  energy grid, which is gas driven, they could knock it out tonight. If they wanted to, if they [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4320.88s)]
*  wanted to knock out any capacity for them to ever make any money, they could knock out all of their [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4326.56s)]
*  refineries tonight because they're clustered on one island. If they want to knock out the supreme [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4332.96s)]
*  leader, they could do that tonight. Trump even said as much. You know, all that was said was that [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4339.52s)]
*  they can't have nuclear weapons, especially based on their history of fomenting terror and the number [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4346.32s)]
*  one state sponsor of terror. Now they wouldn't agree to Donald Trump gave him every opportunity. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4351.92s)]
*  Now it's going to be done for them. The mission will be completed. And for those people that are [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4357.92s)]
*  saying, oh, forever, forever, forever, nothing. It's not mutually exclusive. You can have enough [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4363.68s)]
*  common sense to remove the potential of a Holocaust in our lifetime. And I don't say that lightly. And [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4371.2s)]
*  you know that, but it would be a risk of that because these people have shown they look, [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4378.56s)]
*  they don't care. They're firing at Tel Aviv, one of the largest cities in Israel, indiscriminately [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4384.32s)]
*  killing, trying to kill men, women and children. The Israelis are firing at military targets. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4390.0s)]
*  So if anyone doubts that they'd use that weapon, they are naive, ignorant and stupid. And there are [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4395.04s)]
*  a lot of naive, ignorant and stupid people out there, but I don't focus on that. Not in our audience. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4401.36s)]
*  Thank God we have a president. But I'll tell you this, I gotta go. And walk away. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4406.24s)]

*  that is patriotic based right here in America. Switch to pure talk. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4516.08s)]
*  Oh, yes, there will have more talk on this War Powers Act. Probably tomorrow's a little bit of [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4524.88s)]
*  time goes on. Depending on the issue I'm asked about with Sean on I may hit on it tonight too. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4529.76s)]
*  We'll see. I'll definitely hit on it on one of my weekend shows. Just so people fully understand [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4535.28s)]
*  what we're talking about here because because it it sounds so well, we got the War Powers Act and [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4540.5599999999995s)]
*  Trump's violating it and he has to come to us. It's got to be triggered. It's this that and the [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4545.6s)]
*  other. Now, by the way, he might trigger it because the amount of activity that's going to occur [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4549.68s)]
*  in a very truncated period of time would be protected under the War Powers Act. It just [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4555.6s)]
*  depends if he wants to take it on or not. No president really has and no congress really has. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4560.400000000001s)]
*  They've kind of been at the at sword source pointing at each other, but nobody wants to lose, [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4566.08s)]
*  you see. But if you're real constitutionalist, you know it's unconstitutional. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4572.48s)]
*  It's really that simple and it's also the truth. Pete Hakes had from Fox yesterday. Cut nine, [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4578.4s)]
*  Mr. Producer. Cut nine. Go. What you're watching in real time is peace through strength [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4584.08s)]
*  and America first. Our job is to be strong. We are postured defensively in the region to be strong [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4590.48s)]
*  in pursuit of a peace deal and we certainly hope that's what happens here. And America first means [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4597.6s)]
*  we're going to defend American personnel and American interests. So when you see jets and you [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4603.04s)]
*  see air defense assets and counter UAS assets, that's because my job as the secretary of defense [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4608.88s)]
*  is to ensure that our people are safe and that we're strong so that we can set the conditions [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4615.4400000000005s)]
*  for a deal. And President Trump's made it clear it's on the table. The question is whether Iran [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4620.8s)]
*  will take it. He's also made it clear it is unconditional surrender or else. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4625.04s)]
*  I have a little bit of a different view. Just be done with it. Get it over with. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4632.88s)]
*  Regime change. Did I say regime change? Then I guess I did. Better yet, regime destruction. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4637.6s)]
*  That regime needs to be destroyed. That's all. It needs to be destroyed in order to ensure our [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4645.2s)]
*  security and ensure they don't get missiles that can fire atomic or nuclear warheads here. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4651.92s)]
*  I see Tulsi Garrett become quite controversial. She's being cut out of meetings. Did you see that, [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4659.2s)]
*  Mr. President? Very wise. We'll be right back. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4664.16s)]
*  Bunker somewhere under the brick and steel of a non-district building. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4681.92s)]
*  We've once again made contact with our leader, Mark Levin. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4686.4800000000005s)]
*  Hello, Mark and Mark Levin here. Our number 877-381-3811. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4694.64s)]
*  877-381-3811. Let me read to you. But everybody keeps talking about this piece in the post. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4702.64s)]
*  That would be the New York Post. I guess it was yesterday night. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4710.96s)]
*  But it was in the paper itself. It was something I had posted. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4715.84s)]
*  The Jewish news service carried it to a number of services have carried it. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4721.76s)]
*  I didn't send it to them. They just did. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4727.28s)]
*  So I said, so tired of the isolationists [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4731.92s)]
*  barking about the old and failed foreign policy of the past and insisting that they've uncovered [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4737.12s)]
*  the secret, new way forward, isolationism. And by the way, there were some horrific things done [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4742.5599999999995s)]
*  in the past. There's some fantastic things done in the past. Where's the Soviet Union today? [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4748.4s)]
*  Where is it? If it were up to the isolationists, we'd be dealing with the Soviet Union. We'd be [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4754.16s)]
*  dealing with a powerful China. We'd be dealing with a nuclearized Iran. I mean, think about what [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4759.2s)]
*  they're saying. Think about what Bernie Sanders and his ilk are saying. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4764.320000000001s)]
*  So I said, again, there's nothing new or good about isolationism, which in a word is appeasement. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4768.240000000001s)]
*  It's old and promotes war, such as World War II. Even worse, these knuckleheads can't [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4773.4400000000005s)]
*  coherently explain what they mean. Have you watched them on TV? They're too self-righteous [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4778.320000000001s)]
*  in their ignorance to realize how absurd they sound. They don't agree among themselves about [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4783.84s)]
*  what the hell they're talking about. In fact, they're so blind and self-important, they don't [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4788.88s)]
*  see the new foreign policy taking place in real time right in front of their eyes. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4793.12s)]
*  That's the mindset of ideological fanatics. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4798.0s)]
*  We're witnesses to a foreign policy unlike any since Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4802.88s)]
*  and Pope John Paul II defeated the Soviet Union. It's nothing like the recent failed policies [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4807.2s)]
*  we've seen in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4813.36s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu are together demonstrating how to deal with a genocidal terrorist regime, [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4819.04s)]
*  how to use diplomacy and military power, how to use intel and special forces, how to use the media [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4824.8s)]
*  and public statements and more to defeat the biggest terrorist-supporting regime on the planet. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4830.48s)]
*  It is and has been brilliant, and if all goes well, it will result in a transformed Middle East, [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4836.24s)]
*  an expansion of the Abraham Accords, and a world free of a nuclear terror regime. They are achieving [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4841.84s)]
*  what 47 years of prior policies have not. This is a very big deal. This is a real peace plan. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4846.8s)]
*  Yet the isolationists such as Chatsworth Cotarelson are turning on our president, [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4859.2s)]
*  and they've spent months demeaning Netanyahu. Notice they don't do that to a single Arab leader, [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4867.12s)]
*  not one. Notice they don't do it to the leader of the Islamonazi regime in Tehran. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4872.88s)]
*  I can't think of any time. They prefer the likes of Russian President Vladimir Putin, [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4878.4800000000005s)]
*  who apparently is more magin than Trump according to them. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4884.16s)]
*  Yes, the isolationists, they wind up turning themselves into pretzels, [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4889.92s)]
*  actually characterizing the Iranian regime as oppressed. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4895.76s)]
*  Oppressed. Victimized. These reprobates have never been maga, not real maga. See, [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4898.4s)]
*  I make a distinction, folks, between real maga and fake maga. They've sought to hijack a movement [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4911.44s)]
*  they never created, claimed to be its leaders and influencers, and redefined it to accommodate [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4916.96s)]
*  their own perverse ideological views to the extent they can rationally explain them at all. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4921.759999999999s)]
*  They've clung to a movement they do not support, hence their hesitation in supporting our ally [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4926.96s)]
*  Israel, or outright opposition to it, in its righteous war of survival against the Iranian [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4931.759999999999s)]
*  terrorist regime, which benefits the entire West. It is a regime that has killed and maimed Americans, [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4936.48s)]
*  sought to assassinate the American president, threatens Israel with nuclear annihilation, [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4946.48s)]
*  seeks to slaughter millions of Israelis, has spread death and mayhem in Lebanon, Yemen, [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4952.400000000001s)]
*  Gaza, and Iraq, and has aligned itself with communist China, North Korea, and Russia. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4956.8s)]
*  What else could go wrong? What else could go wrong? The isolationists tell us that to oppose [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4961.12s)]
*  this is to be a warmonger, an anti-maga. Really. Just close your eyes and cover your ears. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4969.12s)]
*  They also don't seem to care that they attract Marxists, Islamists, and anti-Semites. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4978.08s)]
*  Some even openly promote and celebrate them. That's not MAGA either. Trump is a proud American [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4985.84s)]
*  patriot. He despises bigots, and he has done more than any president ever to fight anti-Semitism and [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4991.2s)]
*  anti-Americanism in our country. No, they're not MAGA, but we've seen their like before. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=4997.36s)]
*  That's the piece that's sort of being picked up everywhere. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5003.36s)]
*  Let's see here. Give me one second, folks. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. My printer. I'm not trying [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5012.32s)]
*  to complain. It's not working. So I can't print these things out very well. In fact, at all. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5019.599999999999s)]
*  Now let's do this. Air Force One, Donald Trump. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5028.0s)]
*  What about a ceasefire, Mr. President? Because this Macron, who is a quizzling, he's Vichy France, [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5033.759999999999s)]
*  wants to create a Palestinian state. They've destroyed their country with the open borders, [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5039.679999999999s)]
*  so the Islamists have moved from the Middle East in waves. In France, especially in the Paris [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5044.48s)]
*  suburbs, they've lost control of their country. And so Macron figures he'll keep playing to that [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5050.32s)]
*  particularly group in their constituency on the left and play up his role against the state of [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5058.08s)]
*  Israel. This is what's happening. As I said, revolution or the spreading of Islamism [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5065.36s)]
*  to immigration. Here's the president. Now there's some noise from the airplane talking about, [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5072.32s)]
*  let's go to cut two. No, we're not going to have a ceasefire. Go. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5079.12s)]
*  And then a real end, not a ceasefire. And then something that will be permanent. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5088.96s)]
*  Or giving up entirely. Is that okay, too? Are you close or is that possible? Is that possible? [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5094.4s)]
*  Certainly possible. Complete give up. That's possible. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5102.72s)]
*  He said complete surrender, unconditional surrender, something I said on my Sunday show. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5109.2s)]
*  He's right. John Fetterman, the media every now and then they're taking a run at this guy to tell [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5114.400000000001s)]
*  you there's something wrong in between his ears when in fact there's nothing wrong. There was at [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5119.76s)]
*  one point, there's no question about it, but certainly not now. Very sober in terms of his [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5123.6s)]
*  thinking and his conclusions. These are kind of Democrat that we used to see throughout the [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5129.76s)]
*  country. Pennsylvania has always sent Democrats like this to the Senate, [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5138.32s)]
*  but very rarely now, very rarely, you even see radical left wing cook, [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5143.92s)]
*  Democrat senators coming out of states like Georgia and so forth. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5148.639999999999s)]
*  Well, Fetterman is not that he's fairly moderate. Cut eight. Go. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5152.5599999999995s)]
*  Of course, I'm always going to stand with Israel through this. Now, if I'm an outlier. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5157.04s)]
*  He's not Jewish, just for you people who sort of keep track of these things. Go ahead. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5161.679999999999s)]
*  I guess perhaps I'm unapologetically very pro-Israel. Now here, it's what's true is that [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5168.32s)]
*  Iran has nuclear ambitions 100 percent. Now we can't ever allow them to acquire a bomb. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5175.28s)]
*  What's also true is that they have created the proxies. They have Hamas and Hezbollah. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5182.88s)]
*  Now let's hold them accountable for this. Again, absolutely magnificent. What Israel has done since [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5189.5199999999995s)]
*  Saturday when this launched as well done with such precision and lethality. And we want to support [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5196.72s)]
*  that. Now I think we absolutely got to follow them into this and take out the nuclear facilities [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5202.88s)]
*  because it might not even a true, true path for real peace in the region. Now, because now taking [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5207.68s)]
*  out Iran at this point, that's necessary if you ever have a chance to have any real peace in the [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5215.4400000000005s)]
*  Middle East. I don't really see real peace in the Middle East anytime soon when you see how the [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5220.8s)]
*  Palestinians raised their babies and their children and their teenagers to kill Jews. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5225.52s)]
*  I don't really see that. I don't see the Muslim Brotherhood home base in Egypt all of a sudden [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5231.52s)]
*  saying, okay, we're going home Islamic Jihad, Al Qaeda, ISIS. I don't see them saying, okay, [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5237.76s)]
*  we're out of here. I don't see a lot of real peace in the Middle East. I see growing peace, but [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5244.56s)]
*  but fundamentally, no. The reason the Iranian regime needs to be taken out is because of the [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5250.0s)]
*  human genocidal disaster that they would represent. As I said, it's a seventh century [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5258.0s)]
*  primitive throwback barbarian regime, the 21st century weapons. That's what it is. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5264.0s)]
*  More Fetterman. Let's move up. Cut seven, Mr. Producer. Go. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5272.88s)]
*  I think they should have targeted him. Absolutely gone. Taking him out. I think the way Israel [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5276.16s)]
*  operates, they just take out the leadership just like they did with Hezbollah. And they've already [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5281.76s)]
*  done that with the Iranian leadership. Just folks a question. Doesn't he sound more coherent [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5286.8s)]
*  than say Tim Kaine or AOC or Chris Murphy or Bernie Sanders? He sounds great. The others sound [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5293.12s)]
*  like they've had issues. Go ahead. Take down the whole building. They actually targeted where they [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5303.52s)]
*  lay in bed and now they eliminated the military ones and the nuclear ones. That's magnificent. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5308.4800000000005s)]
*  And the precision in which they've done that. And I don't know why they would have left the leader [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5315.280000000001s)]
*  out. What comes after that? If that reality were to take place, Senator? Well, I think the reality [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5320.0s)]
*  is, you know, I have to be honest, we hear this question all the time and Bill knows the answer [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5327.52s)]
*  and Brett knows the answer. We don't know. So I'm just wondering what is the purpose of a question [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5331.92s)]
*  like that? Is it we shouldn't take out an Islamist terrorist regime that's tried to kill our president, [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5337.92s)]
*  wants to blow up our country, wants to blow up Israel and is behind the slaughter of over 600 [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5345.4400000000005s)]
*  American troops, casualties of over several thousand. I mean, what comes next? [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5351.2s)]
*  Nobody knows what comes next. The one hand, you know, the isolationists say no democracy building. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5358.64s)]
*  The other hand, we're getting the questions from the press. What comes next? The people of Iran will [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5364.64s)]
*  decide what comes next. Go ahead. Just is in a position where they have to be held accountable [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5371.280000000001s)]
*  for what they've done. They are the ones that built and created the proxies like Hamas and Hezbollah [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5376.64s)]
*  and put our whole region in this kinds of chaos. And now they clearly have nuclear ambitions. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5382.24s)]
*  And now I think it's entirely I'm not sure if I might have been the only one constantly calling [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5388.32s)]
*  them to just take this facility out and to use the B2 and those gigantic bunker Buster ones and [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5393.76s)]
*  partner up with Israel what they've done. Excellent. He's excellent. We'll be right back. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5402.5599999999995s)]
*  Mm hmm. Excellent. He's excellent. We'll be right back. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5408.639999999999s)]
*  Let's take some colors here. People have been waiting. Hello. Hello. And hello. Here we are. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5426.96s)]
*  I'm waiting. There it is popped up. JB St. Augustine, Florida. How are you, sir? [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5433.6s)]
*  How are you, Mark? Let me look. I'm great. Thank you. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5441.6s)]
*  It's nice talking with you. Thanks for taking the call. Thank you. You brought up Tulsi Gabbard. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5446.240000000001s)]
*  She kind of brought up. Actually, the president dealt with it. But yes, [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5452.400000000001s)]
*  excuse me before the break, you had brought her name up. Yeah. And, you know, I don't know if [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5456.8s)]
*  people haven't viewed it. They should pull her Hiroshima video. Oh, it's sickening. Well, [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5462.96s)]
*  we know horrific and you know, she didn't go into, you know, [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5474.16s)]
*  that that bomb saved hundreds of thousands of American and Japanese lives. You know, [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5480.8s)]
*  we don't have to get into the whole history there, Mark. People should know it. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5487.44s)]
*  But but I was wondering if you know if she was there in in an official capacity capacity. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5493.04s)]
*  I don't have I don't have the haggis. But if you are the director of national Intel and you're [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5502.08s)]
*  going there, you're certainly going to be treated. I mean, I don't know how many people vacation, [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5508.0s)]
*  right? In Hiroshima. But I have to assume she was there in the official. I'm sensing again, [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5512.32s)]
*  you look at the tea leaves, you look at things that are being said that she is they're giving her [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5517.84s)]
*  distance. She hasn't been in all the meetings. She wasn't a Camp David. Mr. Producer, do we have [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5522.64s)]
*  where the president was asked about her and her view on intelligence and what he said? [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5527.76s)]
*  We have that cut. Can you find that? All right here, I'm going to play cut one for you now. Go. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5532.72s)]
*  Mr. President, you've always said that you don't believe Iran should be able to have a nuclear weapon. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5538.240000000001s)]
*  But how close do you personally think that they were to getting one? Because Tulsi Gabbard, [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5543.12s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard testified in March that the intelligence community said Iran wasn't [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5548.08s)]
*  building a nuclear weapon. I don't care what she said. I think they were very close to having. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5552.48s)]
*  I don't care what she said. I think they were very close. They are very close. Everybody knows it, [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5556.4s)]
*  except Tulsi. And there's something I can't really comment on right now, because again, [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5561.12s)]
*  I want more substance, more sort of authoritative sourcing. But there's a lot out there about leaks, [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5566.88s)]
*  what offices are leaking, who's leaking. And we're going to keep an eye on this because [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5577.44s)]
*  when you leak against the president, he's trying to make national security and [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5582.799999999999s)]
*  life and death decisions because you're trying to create pressure against that president, [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5586.48s)]
*  undermine him. And today he really lashed out at Axios and this clown, [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5591.759999999999s)]
*  the ravied who have I've been warning the world about who writes for Axios. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5596.4s)]
*  And believe it or not, is Israeli, but certainly doesn't seem it. Then if you're doing that and [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5603.04s)]
*  you work at the White House, if you need to go, you need to be fired. Thank you for your call, [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5609.5199999999995s)]
*  my friend. Let's keep going. Mike, Chicago, Illinois, the great WLS. Go. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5614.72s)]
*  Hey, Mark. How are you? Okay. All right. So, you know, I'm, I'm in Chicago. I've [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5621.6s)]
*  supported the president for 10 plus years, 45 years old. And I, you know, the last couple of days, [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5628.240000000001s)]
*  I've just been hearing a lot of this, the back and forth between you and Tucker and other people. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5634.160000000001s)]
*  And in my personal opinion, I think you guys are kind of splitting the base here. I mean, [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5638.56s)]
*  all right, don't be an a-hole pal. I'm not sitting here splitting bases, building bases. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5643.040000000001s)]
*  I'm commenting on what I see. I'm not a political activist. And if you expect me to be quiet, [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5648.0s)]
*  because I offend your friend, Tucker, who does not represent the base. He represents whatever he [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5654.4s)]
*  represents. That ain't happening now. It's never going to happen. You understand? When I have a [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5659.92s)]
*  guy who's got a conga line of anti-semites coming on, when I've got a guy who's now undermining my [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5665.12s)]
*  president of the United States, nah, we're not going to be quiet. And you lied to my call screener, [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5670.4s)]
*  didn't you? So we know who you support, brother. We'll be right back. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5675.599999999999s)]
*  Conservative Fire, the Mark Levene Show. Call in now at 877-381-3811. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5684.4s)]
*  Right after this program in just about 30 minutes, Les, actually, I will be sprinting from here [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5694.24s)]

*  All right, let's go to some callers here. Is this an old list? I don't think so. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5706.639999999999s)]
*  Is Marty still around, Rich? Marty, Long Island, New York. How are you, Marty? [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5713.44s)]
*  Hey, Mark. I'm good. I've been listening to you for quite a while, and I always appreciate your [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5720.32s)]
*  insights. Thank you. It seems to me that there's, sure, I appreciate it. There's so much talk now [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5724.719999999999s)]
*  about regime change. It seems like we're getting lost in that term. And I think although it's [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5730.48s)]
*  an intermediate and necessary step right now, the real end goal is the liberation of the people of [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5737.92s)]
*  Iran and the Middle East. You know, I agree with you. You're not going to get enough support for [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5744.56s)]
*  that. It's not going to happen. It's like the liberation right now, protection of the people [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5749.44s)]
*  of Ukraine. You got to read the room, unfortunately, and the room is what it is. And so if people say, [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5754.32s)]
*  over going war for the liberation of the people of Iran, and I talk about the people of Iran more [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5761.44s)]
*  than anybody else, you're not going to get the kind of support that we need to take out this regime, [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5765.44s)]
*  which is first and foremost, the nukes. And there is no deal that can actually be written or made. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5770.799999999999s)]
*  I don't care if it's the founding fathers who were brilliant. They could write up that prevents [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5777.28s)]
*  evil from being evil. It prevents the communist Chinese from providing them with the fuel for [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5781.679999999999s)]
*  the ballistic missiles that prevents the Russians from providing them with the ground to air missiles [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5785.759999999999s)]
*  and all the rest of it. That's the point. We got to talk about American national security [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5790.64s)]
*  and then our allies national security. I believe I agree with you that these poor people have lived [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5796.08s)]
*  under this iron fist forever. But you're not going to be able to get a groundswell of support for [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5801.280000000001s)]
*  that argument. Now, doesn't mean you can't make it, but I'm telling you, it's just not going to happen. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5806.96s)]
*  How do I know? Because I've tried. Yeah, it's too bad. I think it's a better, better approach than [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5812.400000000001s)]
*  not a better approach. It's not going to work. All right. I don't disagree with you substantively. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5819.84s)]
*  And I think the best approach is to explain to people you have a country that wants to [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5828.08s)]
*  blow us up to face the earth with nuclear weapons. That seems to me to be the number one priority for [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5831.6s)]
*  American intervention. All right, my friend, I appreciate your call very much. Very kind. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5835.84s)]
*  Thank you. Let's keep going. Michael Joplin, Missouri. How are you, Michael? [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5841.52s)]
*  I am great, Mark. How are you doing? As usual, I'm sure you're great. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5847.92s)]

*  My biggest issue with this whole Iran, Israel thing is we've we spent too much time with this [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5856.88s)]
*  crap of appeasement, negotiations. 47 years, 47 years. The first thing they did is take all [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5865.12s)]
*  of our people hostage out of the embassy for 400 and some days till Ronald Reagan stepped in and [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5873.28s)]
*  scared the crap out of them. But you're right. This has been going on almost half a century. I [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5878.719999999999s)]
*  don't know how many more discussions or this, that or the other we need. I don't know what these [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5882.5599999999995s)]
*  isolationists are thinking. I don't even care what they think anymore. Exactly. If we had let Pat go [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5886.799999999999s)]
*  into Russia when he wanted to, we wouldn't be dealing with Russia right now. We're having that [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5893.28s)]
*  stupid parallel line in North Korea. We wouldn't be worrying about North Korea right now. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5898.64s)]
*  And Vietnam, that's another whole another story. Yeah. Drawing that stupid line. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5904.56s)]
*  Don't you find it amazing that people keep talking about we don't want forever wars? [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5909.280000000001s)]
*  I think 47 years is a forever war, don't you? I agree. 100 percent. Enough is enough. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5913.200000000001s)]
*  Say the president wants to put an end to it. Oh, you're not MAGA. Yes, he's MAGA. He is MAGA. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5919.68s)]
*  He created it. 77 million voters. I find it really incredible. The self-importance and [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5925.68s)]
*  self-righteousness, which we call narcissism, where people claim that they represent all these [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5931.84s)]
*  people. They don't. I don't even claim to represent all these people. I never have. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5936.64s)]
*  Yeah. And the biggest thing is you always hear the same thing. It's always everybody says or an [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5942.16s)]
*  anonymous thing. Exactly. No, give me some freaking facts. Otherwise, end it and let's get this done [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5947.6s)]
*  with. I agree. Let's get it over with. They're on their backs for God's sakes. Thank you for your [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5954.64s)]
*  call. Excellent call, Michael, because he's from Missouri. That's the show me state. But I think [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5959.52s)]
*  it's more like the smart state. Eduardo, Oakland, California, listening on the great KSFO. Eduardo, [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5964.8s)]
*  how are you, sir? Very good. Thank you, sir. Mr. Levy, I'm sorry, but I have a blast when I was [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5972.400000000001s)]
*  talking to the screen. It's like I said, please forgive my passion about this. I mean, these guys [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5980.0s)]
*  that just call it, I want to use the word I use, they're referees that just called you before [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5985.76s)]
*  saying that, oh, he's dividing the Maga movement. There is no division. I'm tired to hear this over [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5991.52s)]
*  and over. Listen to you, sir, as well as Kennedy and you being constant, same as Mr. Kennedy and [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=5999.92s)]
*  others about the dangers of nuclear Iran and the president is being saying this for more than a [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6008.88s)]
*  decade. So what is it? You don't have to wait for Mark Levin or Kennedy. Just common sense dictate [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6017.52s)]
*  that that regime in Iran with a nuclear weapon is not a danger only to Israel, but to the world. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6024.64s)]
*  And let me ask you a question, Eduardo. It says here you're from Venezuela. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6031.28s)]
*  So if the communist brutal genocidal regime in Venezuela, pretty close to the United States, [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6035.6s)]
*  as things go, if they were acquiring a nuclear weapon, do you think the United States will put [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6041.76s)]
*  up with that? That's what I'm saying. Exactly. And that's what I said to go. It's like it's not for [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6046.0s)]
*  a minute. These mulets in your, in your note for a minute. Isn't like in Iran, these people are [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6052.0s)]
*  oppressing their own people. That's another thing people have to know. They're oppressing. I talked [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6057.68s)]
*  to Iranian people. They don't, they're oppressed like the Venezuelans. It's the same version, [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6061.84s)]
*  but we have Venezuela. These people, they don't want the well-being of the Western civilization. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6066.24s)]
*  They want to destroy and have a different change. And they will not hesitate, Mr. Levin, [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6071.12s)]
*  to use the nuclear weapon. I'm very sorry to hear that, that, that people are trying to, [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6075.92s)]
*  you know what? I'm thankful that you're straightforward. I'm glad what President [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6080.8s)]
*  Trump says. Yes, you have to with these people call them up, sir. Call them up. When I read the [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6086.32s)]
*  stupid Twitter of Tucker, I listened to him. Sometimes when I did the interview with Putin, [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6092.719999999999s)]
*  it's like, well, what is this guy going? But it's like, honestly, it's using you and Hannity and [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6097.12s)]
*  others. It means nothing. Look, look, look, can I tell you something? These people are panicking. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6104.16s)]
*  They're desperate. They're losing the substantive argument. Not to me, to the American people, [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6109.92s)]
*  the American people are not stupid. They're not stupid. Their audiences are finding out, [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6115.52s)]
*  you know, these grifters and so forth, the things that they say are just so outrageously stupid. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6121.68s)]
*  They're illogical. And then when you put on top of that human experience with evil regimes, [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6126.96s)]
*  I mean, it's just preposterous and people are figuring that out. Now the, [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6134.160000000001s)]
*  the DC media and their entrails, they like these fights and so forth and so on. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6137.68s)]
*  Look, I'm happy to wear the brass knuckles. I'll wear them as long as I have to. It is what it is. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6142.400000000001s)]
*  But I'm a person of substance too. So while I mock these guys and humiliate these guys, [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6147.280000000001s)]
*  I'm more interested in the substance. But you know, many ways like Trump, Trump's a counterpuncher. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6152.0s)]
*  So am I. I don't throw the first punch, but if you're going to throw the punch, you better, [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6157.12s)]
*  you better hit the spot because otherwise, otherwise you've awakened a sleeping, [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6161.2s)]
*  I'm not that I'm a giant, a sleeping Levin. All right, my friend, thank you for your call. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6166.56s)]
*  Although I never sleep. That's the funny thing. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6171.36s)]
*  Mr. Producer thinks he found something to help me. I hope, I hope you're right. Rich. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6174.88s)]
*  All right. But where are we here? Let's take another call. Let's go to Rob Roseville, [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6180.0s)]
*  Michigan. How are you, Rob? Hey, how are you doing? You sound like you're on top of your game today. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6186.96s)]
*  Yes. Thank you. It's funny. You know what, what is today? Tuesday, Friday. I was so beat. I finished [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6193.36s)]
*  and I said to Rich, that was a terrible radio show. I'm very upset about it. Not because of [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6200.72s)]
*  the substance, just because I was so exhausted. And, uh, you know, the show must go on, brother. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6206.400000000001s)]
*  You got to go on no matter what. Go ahead. I'm sorry. Couple of things real quick. I think the [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6212.88s)]
*  most we're going to get into Iran is maybe securing their, their ports and maybe helping out with a [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6217.4400000000005s)]
*  little bit of air cover while the people try and figure out a new, uh, figure out, uh, uh, something [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6223.2s)]
*  to do since we, uh, let president Carter destroy that country and cause a lot of short dead, [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6229.44s)]
*  didn't he? Wow. Also, I'd like to know how I don't think I would you familiarize yourself with the [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6235.919999999999s)]
*  Supreme court ruling minor versus half percent. It's the most excruciatingly detailed explanation [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6244.24s)]
*  of what a natural born citizen is. I've ever read, read. I've read that decision and natural born [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6251.12s)]
*  citizenship is fine, but it has nothing to do with birthright citizenship. That's right. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6258.08s)]
*  That's a concoction. Explains that voting is not a right. It's a privilege or granted. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6263.84s)]
*  That's correct too. But yeah, what you're getting at, I think is we don't treat it that way today, [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6268.88s)]
*  do we? Um, I also want to ask you one other thing. Um, I just heard today that cash Patel had run [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6274.4s)]
*  over, run into those documented, documented fake driver's licenses that were showing up in the [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6282.08s)]
*  country back in 2020 and mid 2020. And they tried to cover it up, but I know of about 22,000, uh, [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6288.08s)]
*  Michigan driver's licenses and about 60 some thousand Texas driver's license. Uh, one group [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6295.92s)]
*  was found in O at O'Hare airport from China and another was found in Houston from China. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6302.08s)]
*  And that's probably one of the reasons why bill Paxton wouldn't let them continue counting ballots [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6307.92s)]
*  after the 2020 election. And, and, and what happens is our guys who are patriotic, not all [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6314.16s)]
*  the Republicans who step in, they see what's happening. They try to deal with it's very [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6321.679999999999s)]
*  difficult to uncover it all and it's roots after the fact they're made to look like fools. You know, [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6325.5199999999995s)]
*  look at this election deniers. All right, my friend, thank you for your call. We'll be right back. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6331.2s)]
*  Love in. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6337.839999999999s)]
*  I'll be on Hannity in a few minutes, actually. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6349.12s)]
*  Never know what's going to happen. Never know what I'm going to say. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6353.28s)]
*  Kind of like here, I organize, organize, but then I say things that I'm thinking about and so forth. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6359.28s)]
*  All right, let's see. What do we have here? Bear with me, America. I want to get a couple [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6365.2s)]
*  more colors in here. If we can, let's go to Dustin Naples, Florida, the great WSKY Dustin. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6369.28s)]
*  How are you, sir? I can't believe I'm talking to the great one, sir. How are you? It is an honor. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6376.719999999999s)]
*  Thank you. Very good. Thank you. I'm, I'm, you have no idea how much of an honor I'm a rush baby. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6380.4s)]
*  And since we lost him, it's you and Sean and Glenn Beck that have kept me sane and you kept, [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6385.44s)]
*  you kept me positive. And thank God we got president Trump, sir. But I'm going to tell you [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6390.08s)]
*  what I, you know, it just, it blows my mind and I could talk to you for an hour, but let me just [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6394.64s)]
*  get to the point. Cause I know you're short. This is the deal, right? If we don't back up [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6401.04s)]
*  what Israel's doing now, Iran is going to come in and they're going to fire a missile and they're [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6408.16s)]
*  going to fire a missile and they're going to obliterate, obliterate Israel. And then they're [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6412.96s)]
*  going to come for us. And if you don't think, and I don't mean you, I'm talking to the people [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6416.64s)]
*  who stand out here and say, we should just not get involved. If you don't think that they cannot do [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6421.6s)]
*  it, they've already got the missile that can reach our shores. I promise we've got to back Israel. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6426.64s)]
*  We've got to do this now. Now is the time they've started this and we cannot leave them out to dry, [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6432.56s)]
*  sir. I thank you so much for everything you do. And I'm looking forward to getting your new book [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6438.08s)]
*  as well. Thank you. I've got every one of them. Your sweetheart. Thank you, brother. I appreciate [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6444.0s)]
*  it. AJ Savannah, Georgia on the Mark Levin app. AJ, how are you, sir? I'm doing well, Mark. It's an [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6448.48s)]
*  honor talking to you. Thank you. You know, it's like I told you call screen. I don't know [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6455.36s)]
*  where Tucker went off. I don't understand it, but I support Israel, whatever Israel has to do [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6461.84s)]
*  to wipe out that regime because it's first of all, I feel that I know a lot of Persian people, [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6469.12s)]
*  but when it comes to to the Muslims, Arabs and all that, I don't think that will ever be our friend. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6476.24s)]
*  Never. Well, the ones who are being trained, the Palestinians, we know we found their books and all [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6485.36s)]
*  the rest of it and others like in Iran, as you point out, but they're not alone, who are being [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6490.56s)]
*  indoctrinated to hate America, to hate Jews, to hate Americans. It's going to be very difficult [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6495.6s)]
*  to reverse that. So it's not, you know, we Westerners, not you, obviously, but Westerners, [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6502.4800000000005s)]
*  we think they think like us. That's not how they think the Islamists Islamists, not Muslims, per [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6508.72s)]
*  se, the Islamists. That's not how they think. And by the way, you're going to like that in my book [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6514.240000000001s)]
*  on power to I can't wait till I have one, a handsome out to a gentleman like you, you know, [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6518.72s)]
*  but the fact of the matter is they don't think this way. And so that's why I keep now I'm calling [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6523.52s)]
*  them primitives and throwbacks and barbarians. That's the regime, not the people, the regime. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6528.8s)]
*  And they impose their will on a civilization that has no modernity. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6533.84s)]
*  The Persian people are highly educated, many professionals. And then this this throwback, [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6538.4800000000005s)]
*  this throwback regime comes in by force, starts executing. You know, this Khomeini, the first one [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6546.0s)]
*  he executed like 30,000 people in the first year or two, just took them right off the streets, [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6552.08s)]
*  teachers, lawyers, broadcasters, whatever you have, he just executed them. And now, of course, [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6556.8s)]
*  they've had more executions in the last 12 to 18 months than they've had in five years. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6562.72s)]
*  They're desperate to hang on the power desperate. My view is they're on their back. There's no [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBC3ATIeJ9g&t=6568.16s)]
