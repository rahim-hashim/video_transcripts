# Military vet sends powerful message to flag-burning pro-Hamas protesters
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [July 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw)
*  All right, what a mess this was and really heartbreaking. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=0.0s)]
*  And now we're learning that charges have been dropped against almost a dozen people who [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=5.8s)]
*  were arrested during these protests in Washington on Wednesday when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=10.46s)]
*  Netanyahu was speaking to Congress. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=14.66s)]
*  Israel bombs USA case. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=16.96s)]
*  Israel bombs USA case. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=20.16s)]
*  How many kids did you kill today? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=22.16s)]
*  How many kids did you kill today? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=24.16s)]
*  So the cases dropped include accusations of crossing police lines, disorderly conduct. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=38.16s)]
*  Fox has confirmed that eight suspects are still facing charges, including assaulting [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=43.96s)]
*  a police officer, making threats and carrying a dangerous weapon. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=48.76s)]
*  Florida Republican Congressman Brian Mast lost both of his legs serving in the army [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=52.88s)]
*  with Afghanistan. He earned a Purple Heart, a Bronze Star and other medals. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=57.92s)]
*  Congressman Mast serves on the Foreign Affairs Committee and he joins me now. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=62.44s)]
*  Congressman Mast, thank you very much for being with us today. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=66.16s)]
*  You know, when you look at those scenes and you see that young man spray painting Hamas [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=70.8s)]
*  on government property, what goes through your mind, sir? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=76.47999999999999s)]
*  Unifying America is when you put that flag on your shoulder, when you fly it over your [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=79.84s)]
*  house, when you see it draped over a casket, like I've seen many times, that's the unification [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=86.12s)]
*  of America. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=90.6s)]
*  That's what this country needs to be about. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  Don't buy into the people that are giving you bus tickets and giving you airfare to [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=94.36s)]
*  flag burning rallies. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=99.16s)]
*  And I tell people, realize this flag burning rally where they smashed the flagpole, took [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=100.84s)]
*  the lock box off, tore down the American flag, burned it and hoisted a Palestinian flag that [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=105.84s)]
*  was literally supported by major unions across the United States of America. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=111.32s)]
*  Ask all of those union workers, is that where you want your union dues going? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=116.6s)]
*  United auto workers, American postal workers, United electrical workers, flight attendants, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=121.24s)]
*  is that where you want your money going? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=126.08s)]
*  How do you know that's what... [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=127.96s)]
*  They were literally, literally on the stage, the stage of that rally. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=128.95999999999998s)]
*  The supporters came out, we put up the videos of it on our own feeds showing there they [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=134.23999999999998s)]
*  are thanking them. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=138.51999999999998s)]
*  Hey, thank you all of these unions for supporting this. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=139.51999999999998s)]
*  There they are standing with their sides directly behind them, literally talking about the people [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=142.16s)]
*  that are their sponsors, also their sponsors on their Twitter feeds, everything else. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=146.28s)]
*  It's well documented. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=150.24s)]
*  They literally sponsored it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=151.24s)]
*  Let's put it back. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=152.88s)]
*  There's another man that the DC Police Department is looking for. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=153.88s)]
*  They're asking for the community's assistance in identifying this man who assaulted a police [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=156.84s)]
*  officer in the unit block of Massachusetts Avenue Northeast. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=161.08s)]
*  If we can put this up on the screen so people can see it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=165.0s)]
*  And he's wearing a mask. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=168.56s)]
*  I don't know why. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=170.16000000000003s)]
*  I don't know why these people are wearing masks at these protests. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=171.76000000000002s)]
*  But you know, Kerry Urbann says that if the DOJ, it will be despicable if the Department [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=175.56s)]
*  of Justice does not bring destroying government property charges here. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=180.72s)]
*  18 U.S.C. 1361 is the statute. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=185.72s)]
*  And we don't see any of that on this list. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=190.48s)]
*  Why is the Department of Justice not doing that, Congressman? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=192.88s)]
*  Because the Department of Justice is what people clich√© refer to as liberal attorneys, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=197.16s)]
*  liberal district attorneys in different places. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=202.52s)]
*  This is the same system that prosecuted Donald Trump. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=204.88s)]
*  For students up in New York that literally took over buildings and college campuses, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  their charges were dropped. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=212.92s)]
*  It was mentioned already, Kamala Harris. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=214.11999999999998s)]
*  She was working to raise money for those during the Black Lives Matter protests that were [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=215.95999999999998s)]
*  to get their bail, to get them out of jail. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=220.88s)]
*  Right. And here we see those literally burning our American flag. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=223.27999999999997s)]
*  The charges are dropped on them. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=226.72s)]
*  Those that broke the flagpole, smashed into it, stole it, pulled it down, burned it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=228.16s)]
*  Their charges are being dropped. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=232.11999999999998s)]
*  That is all part of the same system being in cahoots. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=233.64s)]
*  Well, let's just show a quick video here. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=236.72s)]
*  This is a man who rescued part of the American flag. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=239.16s)]
*  He wants to remain anonymous. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=243.52s)]
*  He's an attorney who worked in the area. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=245.24s)]
*  He said, I just grabbed what I could out of the fire and ran. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=246.84s)]
*  I'm ashamed that I didn't stop and go back and get the rest of it. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=251.0s)]
*  Can we show that clip? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=254.56s)]
*  You know, at least somebody in this group tried to do the right thing, Congressman. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=257.56s)]
*  So damn proud of him. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=264.4s)]
*  So damn proud of him. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=265.6s)]
*  It's, you know, it's heartbreaking to see this happening. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=268.44s)]
*  And we hope that the appropriate charges of destroying government property are brought here. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=272.8s)]
*  We know they were clearly brought in another case and they need to be brought here as well. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=278.16s)]
*  Thank you very much, Congressman. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwNjP-6DSw&t=282.40000000000003s)]
