# Biden ‘weakened’ Israel: Rep. Nancy Mace
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0)
*  South Carolina Congresswoman Nancy Mays joins us. She serves in the House of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=0.0s)]
*  Oversight and Armed Services Committee. Congresswoman, good to see you. Welcome. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=3.36s)]
*  Do you think that this aid package will... Good morning. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Good morning. Will it swiftly move, do you think, through the House this coming week? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=8.8s)]
*  I believe it will move swiftly. And the first thing I want to say this morning is that the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=13.6s)]
*  United States stands with Israel. And what we're witnessing today is we're seeing Joe Biden [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=17.12s)]
*  bend over backwards to pander to the Hamas wing of the Democrat Party. This is... We've gone from [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=23.2s)]
*  peace through strength to war through weakness because of the White House. They are weak on all [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=29.52s)]
*  of these issues. Why is that? Why do you say that? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=35.28s)]
*  Well, I mean, look, just a few weeks ago on March 13th, Joe Biden and his administration [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  allowed a waiver of sanctions to the tune of $10 billion in cold hard cash that would allow [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=44.16s)]
*  Iran to access that money in foreign banks, for example. We know that there was an effort last [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=50.64s)]
*  fall for over the $6 billion, separate issues, separate times. And we're watching Joe Biden just [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=54.88s)]
*  sort of distance himself from Israel. He's saying at the same time he supports Israel, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=62.56s)]
*  he's doing things that then support Iran. You can't have it both ways. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=67.28s)]
*  Well, President Trump in 2019 did the same thing. He issued sanction waivers. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=70.72s)]
*  Is the former president's administration to blame at all for Iranian strength? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=74.80000000000001s)]
*  Well, I go back to even further than that. I look at the Obama-Biden administration and the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  poorly executed nuclear agreement. I go back to Joe Biden's poorly executed Afghanistan withdrawal. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=85.52s)]
*  I think we've all learned a lot over the last couple of years what Iran's point is, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  what they are trying to do. And this is today about Israel. But long term, I believe we're [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  talking about a larger fight that Iran wants to have. This is jihadism. And we've got to be very [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  smart here, regardless of who's in charge. And I believe that we can resolve the global [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=107.6s)]
*  turmoil we're seeing today by getting Donald Trump back in the White House. I don't believe [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=112.55999999999999s)]
*  this would have happened under his leadership. Well, there was an attack, retaliation by Israel [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=116.24s)]
*  when the former president took out Soleimani. And you know, dozens of our military troops [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=121.44s)]
*  suffered brain injuries when Iran sent missiles into two air bases in Iraq. How can the regime [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  that hates us and hates Israel, how can they be curtailed? Do you think they can be overthrown? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=135.11999999999998s)]
*  There have been calls from the opposition to do that. How can we end the theocratic regime in Tehran? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=141.44s)]
*  Well, we've seen attempts to do that in previous administrations, Republican and Democrat alike. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=148.32s)]
*  And I blame some of this going back more than 20 years, some of the disruption and [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=153.67999999999998s)]
*  turmoil we see over there because of our attempts to do that. I think we need to be very surgical [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=158.48s)]
*  here. On the one hand, this week, we're going to pass aid and resources for Israel. At the same [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=163.76s)]
*  time, the House Armed Services Committee, for example, is negotiating the National Defense [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=168.64s)]
*  Authorization Act. I'm talking to our leadership about ways that we can ensure we don't embolden [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=173.2s)]
*  terrorism around the world, that we aren't providing aid or resources or equipment, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=178.56s)]
*  lethally or nonlethally, to countries that align with Iran or countries that oppose Israel. I [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=182.95999999999998s)]
*  think there are a lot of tools in the toolbox that we can use to settle things down in the Middle East. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=187.68s)]
*  Our military capabilities helped Israel, of course, and we directly [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=193.12s)]
*  in trying to repel the Iranian assault. Finally, Congresswoman, do you have a sense of what can [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=197.6s)]
*  be done going forward? The president apparently has told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=204.08s)]
*  the U.S. will not participate if Israel seeks a retaliation to this attack. Do you think that is [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=209.28s)]
*  the wise step? Would you support Israel if indeed the Jewish state retaliates? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=216.32s)]
*  If that is the next step, I'm not certain. I don't agree with the president announcing it [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=221.12s)]
*  to the world because, again, he just weakened Israel by stating to Iran publicly that we won't [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=226.16s)]
*  be by their side if they decide to retaliate. I do believe, as I said previously, there are a lot [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=231.92000000000002s)]
*  of resources at our fingertips. Step one will be this week when the House reconvenes, we'll be back [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=237.04s)]
*  in D.C. tomorrow, getting Israel in a standalone bill the aid that they need to move forward in [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  whatever direction they decide. That will be their decision based on their sovereignty. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=247.92s)]
*  I believe we need to build a coalition of allies who support Israel to help decide what next steps [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=252.0s)]
*  will be around the world and how we can support them. Sanctions should be on the table. Assisting [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=258.32s)]
*  Israel in any way, shape or possible should be on the table. So, too, should we ensure that we are [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=263.44s)]
*  not aiding and abetting or funding the other side of this fight with Iran or anyone who aligns with [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=267.68s)]
*  Iran? And we saw Saudi Arabia and Jordan also defending Israel. Pretty amazing. Hopefully this [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=273.12s)]
*  will go forward. Congresswoman Nancy Mace, good to see you. Thank you so much. Thank you. We'll [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=279.04s)]
*  see how the vote goes, certainly, this week. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWuJkRy5D0&t=283.84000000000003s)]
