# IDF spokesman briefs on Israel's next move
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c)
*  Daniel Hagari, the chief IDF spokesman, is holding a press conference, and he's holding [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=0.0s)]
*  it in English, which is unusual. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=4.98s)]
*  Let's listen to what he's saying. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=7.0600000000000005s)]
*  Daniel Hagari, Chief IDF Spokesman, Israel. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=8.06s)]
*  We intercept dozens of attack drones as well as cruise missiles and ballistic missiles [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=9.06s)]
*  outside of Israel's border. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=13.82s)]
*  A number of Iranian missiles fell inside Israeli territory, causing minor damage to a military [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  base with no casualties. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=24.22s)]
*  Only one little girl has been hurt, and we hope she will be well. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=27.12s)]
*  The Iranian attack is ongoing. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=36.68s)]
*  Our planes are in the air. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  Tonight, wide-scale attack by Iran is a major escalation. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  Together, with our allies and partners, we are operating at full force to defend the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=47.6s)]
*  state of Israel and the people of Israel. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  We will continue to fulfill this mission. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=60.64s)]
*  Questions please. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=64.6s)]
*  CNN is asking, what type and how many projectiles have been fired towards Israel tonight so [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=65.6s)]
*  far, and how many drones and missiles have been intercepted, and can you specify by region? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=70.36s)]
*  The event is still occurring, but until now, over 200 different kinds have been fired. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=76.72s)]
*  We have already intercepted a vast majority of the threats by Israeli systems and with [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=86.4s)]
*  assistance from our partners. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=98.2s)]
*  We are still in the event. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=100.92s)]
*  Our planes are still in the air intercepting targets, and we are ready for any threat that [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=102.64000000000001s)]
*  will come to Israel. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=110.0s)]
*  We will do everything we need to defend the state of Israel. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=112.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=116.48s)]
*  All right, so Danny Higare typically gives very, very brief news conferences, Sandra, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=118.48s)]
*  and he's saying that the attack is still ongoing. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=124.56s)]
*  Some 200 drones, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles have been fired so far in Israel. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  Most of them, he says, have been intercepted, which is very good news. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=132.82s)]
*  One fell near a military base. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=136.54s)]
*  No casualties, with the exception that a young girl sustained some injuries, which do not [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=139.62s)]
*  appear to be life-threatening. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=144.46s)]
*  Yeah, and that little girl, 10 years old, we absolutely hope for the best for her. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=145.46s)]
*  And as you heard from the very end there, we are ready for any threat that comes our [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=149.5s)]
*  way. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=154.02s)]
*  We are ready to defend Israel. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=155.02s)]
*  And John, as we were reporting just a few moments ago, as Trey Yanks was reporting just [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=157.26s)]
*  a few moments ago, the president, President Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu are on the phone [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=160.82s)]
*  right now. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=166.98000000000002s)]
*  Fox has confirmed this. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=167.98000000000002s)]
*  That conversation is happening right now. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=169.34s)]
*  We hope to get a readout from that call and an update from the White House shortly, John. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=171.06s)]
*  Looking forward to that. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=174.78s)]
*  OK, Keith Kellogg is still on the phone with us. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=175.78s)]
*  Keith, there was some chatter coming out of Iran that the target, the main target for [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=178.26s)]
*  this attack was the Nebatim airbase, which is near Dimona, near Beersheba. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=183.16s)]
*  It's also very close to Iran's, to Israel's nuclear facility, rather. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=188.5s)]
*  But I thought that this was interesting. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=194.1s)]
*  You say that this is different than the Al-Assad attack back in 2020, but I thought it was [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=195.86s)]
*  interesting that Iran made it known even before the first drones had entered Israeli airspace [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=201.46s)]
*  that this is over. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=207.58s)]
*  We're done. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=209.42000000000002s)]
*  We did this under Article 51 of the UN Charter. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=210.42000000000002s)]
*  That's it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=213.46s)]
*  But we'll keep watching to see what Israel does. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=214.46s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=216.22000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's a bad misread. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=217.22000000000003s)]
*  And what I mean by a misread is you always have to look through somebody else's lens, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=220.5s)]
*  their opponent's lens when you make a call like that. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=225.46s)]
*  With us, it was different because I remember when we were sitting in the Situation Room [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=228.5s)]
*  and because of persistent overhead observation, we saw the missiles actually, basic cameras [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=232.82000000000002s)]
*  on balloons. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=238.62s)]
*  We could see the missile sitting in Al-Assad airbase. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=239.62s)]
*  And we were sitting in the Situation Room with the president, the vice president, the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=241.86s)]
*  Homeland Security team. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=244.94s)]
*  And we sat there for five, six minutes, didn't say it worked. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=246.38s)]
*  And the president looked up and he said, we're done. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=249.78s)]
*  Walk out the door. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=251.98000000000002s)]
*  And that was it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=253.22s)]
*  We realized that they had given us a pre-advance notice that through the Swiss, through the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=254.22s)]
*  protecting power, that they were going to hit dirt and they did. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=258.94s)]
*  And then we said, OK, that's done. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=262.02s)]
*  This is different because this is an attack on Israel proper. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=263.9s)]
*  Going after Demona was, well, that's a stretch because Demona is their nuclear facility in [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=269.3s)]
*  Israel. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=276.02s)]
*  And if they were attacking that, and they could have hit it if they wanted to with precision [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=277.02s)]
*  It would have changed dramatically what was happening there in Israel. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=281.82s)]
*  But apparently, they haven't hit it yet and are targeted completely because they could [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=286.09999999999997s)]
*  hit it if they wanted to. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=291.86s)]
*  I just think everybody has to sit back and say, what does it look like in the daylight [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=293.46s)]
*  when light shows up? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=297.53999999999996s)]
*  There's seven hours again ahead of us. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=300.46s)]
*  And what are they targeting? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=302.02s)]
*  What do they do? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=303.34s)]
*  Is it counter value targeting, counter force targeting? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=304.34s)]
*  Counter force means going after a military installation. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=307.3s)]
*  Counter value means you're going after civilian targets. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=309.90000000000003s)]
*  What kind of targets were being hit? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=312.74s)]
*  But what I'm talking about a misread is that I think they misread Netanyahu and they misread [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=314.54s)]
*  the way the Israelis look at this. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=320.34000000000003s)]
*  Now, maybe the discussion between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu can kind [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=323.98s)]
*  of change that dynamic of him basically saying, we've got your back and you don't have to [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=329.7s)]
*  respond. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=335.14s)]
*  But that's what the president needs to say publicly to the American people, not in a [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=336.34000000000003s)]
*  private discussion, because he's not just addressing Netanyahu. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=340.74s)]
*  He's just not addressing the American people. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=344.38s)]
*  He's addressing the world. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=346.82s)]
*  And he's setting a condition. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=348.14s)]
*  I think that needs to be done. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=350.34000000000003s)]
*  So again, I'll just close the circuit by saying this, John. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=351.66s)]
*  I think right now, the missiles are still coming in. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=354.22s)]
*  The drones are still hitting. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=358.58000000000004s)]
*  Let's see what happens in the morning, because generally speaking, there's a great army axiom. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=360.58000000000004s)]
*  The first few quarters, always wrong. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=365.18s)]
*  Let's see what happens. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=366.62s)]
*  General, just going through what we just heard there from the Israeli officials on the approximately [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=368.62s)]
*  200 missiles that have been launched there now saying toward Israel, very few missiles [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=375.78s)]
*  fell inside Israel. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=382.09999999999997s)]
*  But as we just heard, one caused very small limited damage to a military base. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=384.02s)]
*  One 10-year-old girl was injured. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=389.02s)]
*  We just heard. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=390.38s)]
*  The event has not ended yet. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=391.65999999999997s)]
*  We know that this conversation is happening with Netanyahu and Biden right now. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=394.1s)]
*  And General, you go back to Iran vowing revenge since April 1st, since that airstrike in Syria [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=398.5s)]
*  killed two Iranian generals inside the Iranian consular building. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=403.58s)]
*  Our message from President Biden this week was, don't. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=408.86s)]
*  Well, here we are. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=413.82s)]
*  So now they're having this phone call. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=415.86s)]
*  What do you imagine the conversation is between these two leaders right now? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=418.06s)]
*  Yeah, well, to answer a great question, because President Biden said don't, Secretary Blinken [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=422.94s)]
*  said don't, and Lloyd Austin also said don't. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=429.70000000000005s)]
*  Well, the response that Netanyahu should say, well, they're doing, they're doing, they're [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=432.62s)]
*  doing. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=437.54s)]
*  And that's a response. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=438.54s)]
*  And part of that is because we have not convinced them that there's real deterrence in the [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=440.26s)]
*  Middle East supporting what's supported by the United States. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=446.46000000000004s)]
*  Do the Israelis have a better defense and a better deterrence message than we do? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=449.94s)]
*  Because we haven't sent a clear message. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=455.46s)]
*  Here's the clear message we should have sent. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=457.06s)]
*  And the clear message we should have sent when missiles started flying from the Houthis [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=459.46s)]
*  and the missiles supported by the Iranians in the Red Sea is we should have put on the [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=464.26s)]
*  bottom of the sea the spy ship the Iranians have that was doing the targeting there in [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=468.09999999999997s)]
*  the Red Sea. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=473.46s)]
*  That sends you a message out. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=474.46s)]
*  And I think what's going to happen is you're going to see the Israelis not accept this [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=475.7s)]
*  message. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=479.9s)]
*  They're going to send the message back. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=480.9s)]
*  And the message back is, you know, we'll make the decision when it's over and we're going [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=481.9s)]
*  to send a very clear message back to you that this is unacceptable. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=486.53999999999996s)]
*  I think what you're going to see Biden telling Netanyahu is, look, don't go there. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=490.65999999999997s)]
*  You know, don't really, you know, don't get them all, you know, fired up about it. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=495.02s)]
*  I don't think Netanyahu is going to listen to them at all. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=498.85999999999996s)]
*  I think they're going to respond. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=500.9s)]
*  All right, General Kellogg, if you could stand by with us as the news breaks. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=503.53999999999996s)]
*  And this seems to be changing by the minute, as we heard from Trey Inxt on the ground there. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=507.82s)]
*  By the way, an update from Trey, we did lose signal with him there. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=512.62s)]
*  He is fine and we will hear again from him shortly. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=515.78s)]
*  John. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=518.18s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=519.18s)]
*  Thanks, General. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYpwlL-MF2c&t=520.18s)]
