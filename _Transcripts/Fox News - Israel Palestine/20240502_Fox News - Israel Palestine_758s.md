# Kayleigh McEnany: I give Biden no credit for this
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [May 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA)
*  Well, it is a busy news day today and moments ago we saw the former president Donald Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=0.0s)]
*  walking back into his New York criminal trial and they are resuming at this time after a [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=7.84s)]
*  very short break. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=14.32s)]
*  And you know, it's the former lawyer now who get a cross-examination by defense attorneys. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  That lawyer represents the former sex film worker Stormy Daniels and that former lawyer [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=23.86s)]
*  is going to take the stand for cross-examination as I mentioned by the defense and earlier [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=30.88s)]
*  today both sides, the defense and the prosecution were arguing if Trump committed more gag order [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=34.8s)]
*  violations. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=40.58s)]
*  Prosecution says there were four additional ones. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=42.1s)]
*  They're not asking for jail time this time. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=44.0s)]
*  Well, how generous are they? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=46.260000000000005s)]
*  Because that would be just a gift to a Republican candidate running for the White House, Donald [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=47.620000000000005s)]
*  Trump, right? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=52.7s)]
*  Because it would put him right in a spot with the optics of that would be horrible if it [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=54.260000000000005s)]
*  ever happened. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=58.46s)]
*  So we are all over it, stem to stern. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=59.660000000000004s)]
*  We're getting moment by moment updates that we will share with you in real time from our [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  producers and journalists who are inside the courtroom. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=65.56s)]
*  First though, let's get new reaction from President Biden on the violent anti-Israel [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=68.58s)]
*  protests, the Jewish hate that is sweeping across college campuses in America. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=73.10000000000001s)]
*  He says dissent is a key part of our American democracy. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=78.34s)]
*  However, that dissent should never lead to disorder that we've been seeing. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=81.86s)]
*  We've all seen images and they put to the test two fundamental American principles. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=87.06s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=93.94s)]
*  The first is the right to free speech and for people to peacefully assemble and make [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=95.74s)]
*  their voices heard. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=101.06s)]
*  The second is the rule of law. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=102.74s)]
*  Both must be upheld. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=106.26s)]
*  So let me be clear. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=107.89999999999999s)]
*  Peaceful protests in America, violent protest is not protected. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=109.77999999999999s)]
*  Peaceful protest is. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=114.74s)]
*  It's against the law when violence occurs. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=116.53999999999999s)]
*  Destroying property is not a peaceful protest. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=119.38s)]
*  It's against the law. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=122.1s)]
*  Vandalism, trespassing, breaking windows, shutting down campuses, forcing the cancellation [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=124.1s)]
*  of classes and graduations, none of this is a peaceful protest. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=129.1s)]
*  Destroying people, intimidating people, instilling fear in people is not a peaceful protest. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=134.34s)]
*  It's against the law. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=139.74s)]
*  There should be no place on any campus, no place in America for anti-Semitism or threats [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=141.1s)]
*  of violence against Jewish students. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=147.42000000000002s)]
*  There is no place for hate speech or violence of any kind, whether it's anti-Semitism, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=150.02s)]
*  Islamophobia or discrimination against Arab Americans or Palestinian Americans. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=155.3s)]
*  It's simply wrong. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=160.54s)]
*  There's no place for racism in America. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=161.54s)]
*  It's all wrong. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=164.57999999999998s)]
*  It's not American. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=165.29999999999998s)]
*  I understand people have strong feelings and deep convictions. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=166.78s)]
*  In America, we respect the right and protect the right for them to express that. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=170.26s)]
*  But it doesn't mean anything goes. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=175.94s)]
*  It needs to be done without violence, without destruction, without hate and within the law. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=178.94s)]
*  We wanted to give you those hour ago comments that we took live during the Faulkner Focus [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=186.1s)]
*  so that we can really get into what was there and what might be missing. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=191.66s)]
*  This is Outnumbered. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=195.57999999999998s)]
*  I'm Harris Faulkner here with my co-host, Kayleigh McEnany and Emily Campagno. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=196.57999999999998s)]
*  Also joining us today, Fox News contributor and former State Department spokesperson, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=201.14s)]
*  Marie Harf, Fox Business anchor, David Asman. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=205.1s)]
*  David, I'm going to start with you about what we heard and what you feel may be missing. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=208.34s)]
*  By the way, he didn't take any questions. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=214.06s)]
*  He spun on his heels and walked right out the door. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=215.7s)]
*  That's what I was going to say was missing. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=217.7s)]
*  Some sort of dialogue between the president. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=219.82s)]
*  This is one of those moments, I think you'll agree, Kayleigh, when it's really important [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=222.9s)]
*  for the president to play the role that you play, to have a dialogue with the press who [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=226.9s)]
*  were there to ask the questions that Americans have. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=231.22s)]
*  I had no problem with what he said. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=233.82s)]
*  I thought what he said was well phrased. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=235.3s)]
*  I thought he delivered it in a straight fashion. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=237.5s)]
*  But why was it so late? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=240.22s)]
*  This is something that's been going on. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=242.78s)]
*  How much of what we've seen over the past 48 hours, if not the past week, could have [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=244.3s)]
*  been prevented had he said that earlier? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=250.82s)]
*  But again, I don't want to bury a good statement, which is what that was. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=255.22s)]
*  It was read though, and there wasn't that dialogue. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=259.34s)]
*  That's what I think was missing. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=262.46s)]
*  Well, and I'm glad we started off with mostly his full comments because I think it's important [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=263.46s)]
*  for everybody to kind of keep seeing it and digesting that because we may not get another [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=269.66s)]
*  nugget for nine days. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=273.12s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=274.12s)]
*  Emily? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=275.12s)]
*  Right? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=276.12s)]
*  I think it was a little too little too late. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=277.12s)]
*  However, I appreciated that he acknowledged that even vandalism, even property destruction, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=278.78000000000003s)]
*  even threats, that all of those things are not only criminal, but that they are not peaceful [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=286.24s)]
*  protests. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=290.58000000000004s)]
*  And I really appreciated that he delineated for everyone who has been saying this entire [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=291.58000000000004s)]
*  time, oh, they're peaceful. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=295.86s)]
*  No, they are not. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=296.86s)]
*  They are anything but. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=297.86s)]
*  If you sit there cross-legged in the middle of grass and yet you are holding a sign that [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=299.41999999999996s)]
*  is calling for the extermination of the Jewish people in some veiled way, yes, that is violent. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=303.9s)]
*  So I appreciated that. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=310.06s)]
*  And I also just have to point out the drama and the joke that is these outside agitators [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=311.46s)]
*  that are coming in and then requesting a laundry list of items that isn't just, you know, food [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=317.05999999999995s)]
*  and water like we saw the plaintiff students at Columbia doing, but they are asking for [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=322.26s)]
*  utility gloves and zip ties and skateboard helmets and no bagels, please, and no bananas. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=326.94s)]
*  But yes, we want this. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=333.18s)]
*  It would be laughable if again it wasn't violent that these people are thinking that we are [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=335.18s)]
*  going to somehow acknowledge and therefore provide their Santa wish list and ignore that [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=340.34s)]
*  they are calling for the death of an entire group of people. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=348.18s)]
*  I mean, it's a joke to me. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=351.34s)]
*  And I hope these campuses come out and acknowledge that part of it too. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=353.02s)]
*  So I just want to follow up quickly with you, Emily, because you make such a good point. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=357.85999999999996s)]
*  I mean, in some instances they are calling for the death of Jews on their campuses and widely. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=361.06s)]
*  But they are not calling for the life of Palestinians, which is what I thought all of this was about. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=367.18s)]
*  Are they taking the food that they accumulate to RAFA? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=373.18s)]
*  Because I want to know. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=377.7s)]
*  These are some of the most privileged people on the planet. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=378.94s)]
*  And if they are not paying for it, Biden is going to pay for it through student loans. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=382.74s)]
*  So I'm really curious to know. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=386.78000000000003s)]
*  Which means we're paying for it. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=388.34000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, which means we're paying for it. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=389.34000000000003s)]
*  I mean, you bring up the death. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=390.62s)]
*  I want to talk about the life. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=391.74s)]
*  None of it really has anything to do with what they're doing that's helpful to anybody. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=393.02s)]
*  Marie, you know, the one question I had was why the president didn't lean in on calling [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=397.3s)]
*  on these universities, particularly the private ones that have the policies to do this, to [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=403.42s)]
*  suspend and expel, to go through their roster and see who has a foreign visa to be here [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=410.46s)]
*  and to put them on a list for deportation for actions that violate policy, that violate [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=416.73999999999995s)]
*  laws. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=421.18s)]
*  Well, clearly they're violating laws because they're getting arrested. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=422.18s)]
*  Harris, I thought what was interesting, he didn't take questions, you're right, but he [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=424.29999999999995s)]
*  did get two shouted questions that he answered at the end. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=427.85999999999996s)]
*  And I want to mention those because I think they're very interesting. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=430.14s)]
*  One is they asked if he would change his policy towards Israel because of the protest and [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=433.02s)]
*  he said no. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=436.9s)]
*  You know, Biden is getting a lot of pressure from parts of his political constituency over [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=438.09999999999997s)]
*  this issue. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=442.9s)]
*  He is squarely stood by Israel. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=443.9s)]
*  He keeps getting more and more aid to them. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=445.09999999999997s)]
*  He's standing up for them in the international community. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=447.41999999999996s)]
*  And that was an interesting answer to me that he said no. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=449.65999999999997s)]
*  You know, he believes this deeply. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=452.9s)]
*  He is a Democrat of a generation and a certain political bent that really believes this, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=454.53999999999996s)]
*  Harris. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=459.53999999999996s)]
*  And the second question was about whether the National Guard should go in. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=460.53999999999996s)]
*  He also said no. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=462.34s)]
*  So I think that he struck a really good tone in this statement, delineating, as Emily said, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=463.74s)]
*  between the different kinds of protests. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=468.86s)]
*  I think, you know, it's also up to each university and each city and each state to figure out [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=470.42s)]
*  how to deal with this themselves. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=475.98s)]
*  I think Biden being too forceful on that is maybe when each of them are trying to navigate [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=477.5s)]
*  this in different ways is maybe not the most helpful thing to do. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=482.38s)]
*  I think what he did say was helpful, though. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=484.82s)]
*  I want to get to this, Kayleigh, before I come to you earlier today, before the president [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=487.38s)]
*  spoke. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=491.02s)]
*  Former President Trump had words about the anti-Israel protesting unfolding. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=492.02s)]
*  I will comment just quickly on the colleges and universities. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=498.34s)]
*  It's a shame. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=501.9s)]
*  I'm so proud of the New York's finest. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=502.9s)]
*  They're great. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=505.38s)]
*  They're great people, too. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=506.38s)]
*  I know so many of them. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=507.38s)]
*  They're incredible. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=508.38s)]
*  They did a job at Columbia and likewise in Los Angeles. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=509.38s)]
*  They did a really good job at UCLA. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=513.62s)]
*  It was very much embedded. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=515.26s)]
*  And just so you understand, this is the radical left. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=517.46s)]
*  This is a movement from the left, not from the right. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=520.02s)]
*  The right is not your problem. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=522.42s)]
*  Despite what law enforcement likes to say, the FBI director said that he worries about [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=524.22s)]
*  the right. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=531.42s)]
*  Don't worry about the right. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=532.42s)]
*  The right's fine. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=533.42s)]
*  Worry about the left because this is a movement from the left. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=534.5799999999999s)]
*  These are radical left lunatics. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=537.26s)]
*  And they got to be stopped now because it's going to go on and on and it's going to get [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=540.5s)]
*  worse and worse. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=543.98s)]
*  And, you know, they take over countries, okay? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=544.98s)]
*  We're not letting them take over the USA. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=548.22s)]
*  We're not letting the radical left morons take over this country. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=550.5400000000001s)]
*  You can't let that happen. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=556.4200000000001s)]
*  So it's a political issue in the presidential campaigns now. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=559.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=562.58s)]
*  Bingo. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=563.58s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=564.58s)]
*  Stop talking to me about the right and anti-Semitism. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=565.58s)]
*  This is a problem of the left. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=567.44s)]
*  Joe Biden hails from the left. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=569.3000000000001s)]
*  He is a Democrat president. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=570.9s)]
*  I'm sorry, but I give him no credit today. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=572.5s)]
*  Zero credit today. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=574.94s)]
*  I like to give Biden credit when credit's due. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=576.34s)]
*  Not today. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=578.5s)]
*  April 22nd is the last time you spoke about this. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=579.5s)]
*  Well, why did you speak today is the question. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=582.46s)]
*  Here's what I postulate. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=584.46s)]
*  Axios put out a piece yesterday. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=585.46s)]
*  Democrats are petrified about this issue. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=587.98s)]
*  They asked a Democrat lawmaker, are you worried about this issue? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=589.4200000000001s)]
*  How could we not be? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=593.02s)]
*  Right? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=594.02s)]
*  Does it give you a political heartburn? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=595.02s)]
*  How could you not be? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=596.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=597.02s)]
*  So Biden speaks today because politically the moment demanded it. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=598.02s)]
*  But what did he have time to do over the last nine days? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=600.82s)]
*  He went to the White House Correspondents' Dinner. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=604.22s)]
*  He did a campaign event in D.C. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=609.02s)]
*  He did a campaign event in Delaware. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=610.4200000000001s)]
*  He found time for all of that. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=612.4200000000001s)]
*  He even went on Howard Stern. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=613.58s)]
*  He found all the time in the world for that. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=614.9s)]
*  But he couldn't speak out about this. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=617.1800000000001s)]
*  You don't get credit for that. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=619.1s)]
*  And then about a minute into his speech, which by the way only lasted about a minute or two. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=620.62s)]
*  So yeah, clearly not prioritizing this, about a minute or two to speak. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=624.4200000000001s)]
*  He says this is not a moment for politics. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=627.62s)]
*  It's a moment for moral clarity. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=629.74s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=630.74s)]
*  If it's not a moment for politics, then why have you treated it so politically? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=631.74s)]
*  Here's the sad part. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=635.46s)]
*  The press will let him get away with this. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=636.54s)]
*  If Donald Trump had delivered those exact same remarks in the exact same timeline, the [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=638.98s)]
*  White House press briefing room would be at a fever pitch. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=643.9s)]
*  I would be yelled at. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=646.54s)]
*  He would be yelled at. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=647.58s)]
*  We would be asked, do you denounce the support from any anti-Semitic protester? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=648.58s)]
*  And unless we denounced every young person in the country, that wouldn't be enough. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=653.72s)]
*  And then we would be asked, will you pull their student loans? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=657.34s)]
*  If we didn't answer, there would be a ferocious roar from the White House press corps. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=660.02s)]
*  As Donald Trump said, Joe Biden is the moral authority for this country. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=664.74s)]
*  Has he acted like it? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=669.34s)]
*  No, he's led from behind. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=670.62s)]
*  The former president has been the moral authority on this issue, not the current one. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=672.46s)]
*  Can I just add one quick thing, which is that the old phrase, actions speak louder than [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=677.02s)]
*  words. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=681.46s)]
*  We heard good words. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=682.46s)]
*  I thought they were good words from the president, but where are the actions? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=683.46s)]
*  Not only good words from the mayor of New York, but he had action the night before. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=687.26s)]
*  So he delivered something in addition to his comments, two very different presentations [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=692.22s)]
*  of that side of the story. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=698.42s)]
*  So what people would ask then, what would the equivalent be to what Eric Adams did and [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=700.62s)]
*  what the president could have done? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=705.62s)]
*  This FBI has said, and that's what you and the former president were pointing to, that [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=707.1s)]
*  hate crimes, particularly among white supremacists, were the thing that they were really focusing [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=712.86s)]
*  on. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=717.5s)]
*  Right? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=718.5s)]
*  They hate Jews, too. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=719.5s)]
*  So they say, I mean, that's what the signage is. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=720.5s)]
*  Where's the FBI? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=722.62s)]
*  I thought they were going to defend against anti-Semitism. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=723.62s)]
*  Only when it's... [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=726.7800000000001s)]
*  Congress should bring the FBI. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=727.7800000000001s)]
*  So the president could have called for that, too. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=728.7800000000001s)]
*  And on a re-ask, maybe he would have gotten that question. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=730.98s)]
*  But when you walk away on your heels, bye-bye Biden. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=734.7800000000001s)]
*  What do we call it? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=737.1800000000001s)]
*  It's a game? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=738.1800000000001s)]
*  Where in the world is Biden? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=739.1800000000001s)]
*  Oh, where in the world is Carmen Sandiego? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSpMCpk2QaA&t=740.1800000000001s)]
