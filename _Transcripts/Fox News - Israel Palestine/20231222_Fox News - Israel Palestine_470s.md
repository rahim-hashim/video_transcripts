# UN torched for voting to 'give aid to Hamas'
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg)
*  The United Nations Security Council just a few minutes ago voting 13 to 0 to boost aid [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=0.0s)]
*  to the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=7.24s)]
*  The United States and Russia abstained from the vote. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=8.82s)]
*  Now, today's vote comes after nearly two weeks of negotiations and already several days of [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=12.52s)]
*  delays. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=18.52s)]
*  Greg Palcott with more from Tel Aviv, Israel. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=19.52s)]
*  Greg. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=22.96s)]
*  Hey, Emily. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=23.96s)]
*  Yeah, we just got this vote in from the UN Security Council regarding the Israel-AMAS [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=25.44s)]
*  war. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=30.96s)]
*  And to some degree, it's a vote in favor of trying to deal with this battle. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=31.96s)]
*  The vote went 13-0. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=38.84s)]
*  That nothing means no no's, no vetoes. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=42.040000000000006s)]
*  But there were two abstentions, one from the US and one from Russia. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=46.56s)]
*  That doesn't sound great, but in fact, an abstention from the United States is a positive [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=50.94s)]
*  thing. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=55.94s)]
*  The US had been working on reworking the language for the past week or so on this resolution, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=56.94s)]
*  first dealing with the humanitarian pause. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=64.58s)]
*  The initial wording had a direct demand that a ceasefire would take place. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=68.34s)]
*  The US came up with some compromised language. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=74.02s)]
*  I'm looking for it now. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=76.9s)]
*  The UN saying that the conditions should be created for the cessation of hostilities. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=78.78s)]
*  Conditions created for the cessation of hostilities. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=84.18s)]
*  Also regarding humanitarian aid, there's been a bit of a sticking point on that. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=86.98s)]
*  The UN just flatly saying all humanitarian aid should go in controlled by the UN. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=91.18s)]
*  By all means, the US has been worried, as has Israel, that maybe some other stuff could [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=97.1s)]
*  get mixed in with that aid if Israel doesn't have a hand in it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=102.5s)]
*  So basically what they're calling for steps, the resolution says, steps would be taken [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=106.1s)]
*  to allow in more humanitarian aid. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=111.46s)]
*  Those steps could mean, yes, more aid could be coming, but maybe not a full-blown rush [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=114.89999999999999s)]
*  of aid as had been initially referred to in the wording. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=122.25999999999999s)]
*  So again, that was enough for a US abstention. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=127.13999999999999s)]
*  US Ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, and she frankly overnight had said, yes, the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=130.98s)]
*  resolution as it stands is something we could vote on, which is kind of short of saying [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=138.22s)]
*  vote for, and that's exactly what happened. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=143.17999999999998s)]
*  Russia had problems with the wording too. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=146.29999999999998s)]
*  Russia probably did not think it went as far as a lot of other people would have liked [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=148.66s)]
*  it to have gone, and this was their way of issuing an opinion. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=153.66s)]
*  But again, they didn't issue a veto either. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=157.34s)]
*  So I think this is seen overall as a win for the folks trying to rein in a bit the Israeli [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=160.38000000000002s)]
*  war against Hamas. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=167.82000000000002s)]
*  Not a full-blown win, but maybe a qualified win. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=169.54000000000002s)]
*  Emily, let me just bring you up to date just on one final point. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=173.22s)]
*  Bad hostage news. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=177.98000000000002s)]
*  It was announced today that 73-year-old Gadi Higai, an Israeli-American held hostage by [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=178.98000000000002s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=184.58s)]
*  He's actually dead in captivity. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=185.58s)]
*  He was shot and killed on October 7th when Hamas came into his kibbutz and took him away. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=186.98s)]
*  His body remains in Gaza. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=192.61999999999998s)]
*  He's the first of eight American dual citizens held inside Gaza that we now know is dead. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=194.54s)]
*  He leaves behind his wife, who was kidnapped as well, and plus four children, seven grandchildren. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=200.29999999999998s)]
*  So very bad news that way. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=206.85999999999999s)]
*  Somewhat hopeful news coming out of the UN. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=210.17999999999998s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=212.78s)]
*  Greg, thank you for that. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=213.78s)]
*  We're going to bring the conversation back to the couch and our prayers just go out to [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=216.1s)]
*  the Higai family, Congressman. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=220.1s)]
*  What heartbreaking news. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=222.24s)]
*  This against the landscape that we've learned that Hamas has rejected an offer by Israel [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=223.85999999999999s)]
*  of a ceasefire in exchange for hostages. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=229.06s)]
*  So it's a poignant loss, always the loss of a human life. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=231.56s)]
*  This is an American-Israeli dual citizen. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=235.72s)]
*  And now the UN votes for more funding to Gaza. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=238.57999999999998s)]
*  What say you? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=242.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think the interesting part is, and of course it is tragic we're seeing this happen [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=243.0s)]
*  and that's part of what we've been seeing since October. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=246.06s)]
*  The question that actually comes to my mind though is with this resolution, I think Bill, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=249.3s)]
*  he actually said it there, this is a victory for Hamas in this battle with Israel. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=253.62s)]
*  So you're putting for the first time the UN saying this needs to happen, we need more [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=258.48s)]
*  aid put into Gaza, which at that point is like a government program here in the US. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=263.18s)]
*  Once that first step is there, then what is the next step? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=267.54s)]
*  We were talking about this. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=269.9s)]
*  Is it going to be UN actual control of this aid? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=270.9s)]
*  And if UN control is that, then they need security, which means security forces are [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=273.34s)]
*  going to have to come into play here. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=276.78s)]
*  This one is interesting that we abstain from this. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=278.65999999999997s)]
*  Well, you know what Hamas never seems to run out of? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=281.09999999999997s)]
*  Rockets. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=284.59999999999997s)]
*  They're not voting to give aid to innocent Gazans, they're voting to give aid to Hamas. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=285.59999999999997s)]
*  You look at the Gazan population, it's something like 47% live in poverty, 80% live in poverty, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=291.21999999999997s)]
*  there is a 47% unemployment rate. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=298.41999999999996s)]
*  Yet Hamas has a real estate and an investment portfolio of something like $500 million in [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=300.7s)]
*  an annual military budget of $350 million. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=306.1s)]
*  So where do you think that money is going people? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=309.18s)]
*  That's right. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=311.7s)]
*  And you spoke about that. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=312.7s)]
*  Yeah, this is just a heartbreaking situation. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=313.7s)]
*  You know, we always have to think that there are some innocent civilians in Gaza. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=315.58s)]
*  They're not all terrorists. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=320.68s)]
*  But when you think about where is all this humanitarian aid going and what is it, food, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=322.14s)]
*  antibiotics, medications to conduct operations, you know, at the beginning of the war, the [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=327.74s)]
*  doctors in the hospitals in Sheba Hospital, they did not have the medicines that they [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=332.94s)]
*  needed to take care of the innocent children who were suffering as a result of Hamas terrorist [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=337.78000000000003s)]
*  action. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=342.58000000000004s)]
*  So we have to think, okay, we need to help the innocent. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=343.58000000000004s)]
*  But yet, yes, to your point, Lisa, a lot of this aid is going to Gaza, I'm sorry, to Hamas. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=346.3s)]
*  A lot of them we know that are using undercover schools and hospitals and churches to hide [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=352.82s)]
*  and disguise themselves. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=358.65999999999997s)]
*  But it's a hard balance because they need the help. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=360.65999999999997s)]
*  They need the basics, necessity of life to survive. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=364.5s)]
*  But at the same time, we need to do everything we can to eradicate Hamas off the face of [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=367.71999999999997s)]
*  this world. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=372.86s)]
*  Well, it is a really big deal. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=373.86s)]
*  It is a really big deal that we just learned that the first U.S. hostage has died. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=374.86s)]
*  We all celebrated the release of the little girl, first American to be released and to [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=382.1s)]
*  hear that the first American hostage who was held hostage for how many days now has passed [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=389.26s)]
*  away is something you need to take a beat and think about this man and his life and [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=395.94s)]
*  the news and think about the consideration that the Biden administration might be under [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=400.58s)]
*  now after I know that the U.N. can be very confusing. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=403.94s)]
*  I just got a lesson from Doug on really what this means. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=408.78s)]
*  But by abstaining from this vote, that means that the Biden administration in the United [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=412.38s)]
*  States just basically said hands off, OK, let this aid go to Gaza, which means let this [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=417.42s)]
*  aid possibly go to Hamas. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=423.18s)]
*  If the United States said no, voted no, then the aid would not have, there would not have [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=426.38s)]
*  been an increase in aid. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=431.58s)]
*  So to have these two things happen at the same time is notable. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=433.18s)]
*  One last thing, I'm so sorry, I just want to say one last thing. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=437.34s)]
*  There was this political report that Kamala Harris is now pushing the White House to be [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=439.74s)]
*  more sympathetic towards Palestinians. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=444.46s)]
*  I would urge her to remember this man and all the United States citizens who died in [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=446.62s)]
*  this terror attack before she rushes to be for sympathy towards Palestinians. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=450.53999999999996s)]
*  I understand the innocent civilians there. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=455.98s)]
*  They're also being held hostage by Hamas. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=458.14s)]
*  They also voted Hamas into power. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMFdvYjmMg&t=460.42s)]
