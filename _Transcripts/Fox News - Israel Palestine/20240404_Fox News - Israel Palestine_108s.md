# Biden demands Gaza cease-fire in call with Netanyahu
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XutVDdxp6o)
*  White House correspondent Peter Ducey was in that rather tense at times briefing, and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XutVDdxp6o&t=0.0s)]
*  he just came out to join us. Our White House correspondent. Hi, Peter. Martha, we're being [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XutVDdxp6o&t=4.72s)]
*  told this Biden at Yahoo call was both good and direct. But even though White House officials [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XutVDdxp6o&t=8.8s)]
*  don't want to announce a firm policy change, what they're saying today is different than [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XutVDdxp6o&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  what they said in the aftermath of the attack. October 7th, the president put a statement [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XutVDdxp6o&t=20.52s)]
*  out. Part of it said his support for Israel's security is rock solid and unwavering. But [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XutVDdxp6o&t=24.28s)]
*  now they're saying if there are not changes on their side, there's going to have to be [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XutVDdxp6o&t=29.16s)]
*  some changes on our side. How is his support unwavering? But you're also reconsidering [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XutVDdxp6o&t=33.6s)]
*  policy choices. Both can be true. They cannot be true. They're completely different things. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XutVDdxp6o&t=40.96s)]
*  No, no, no. I'm sorry. He is wavering. How is he not wavering? Come on now. As I said, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XutVDdxp6o&t=47.2s)]
*  as it says in that readout, we made clear and and he made it clear to the prime minister [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XutVDdxp6o&t=56.72s)]
*  on his call that our support for Israel's self defense remains ironclad. They face a [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XutVDdxp6o&t=61.92s)]
*  range of threats and the United States isn't going to walk away from helping Israel defend [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XutVDdxp6o&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  itself. That said, you can say all that and you can act on that and you can believe that [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XutVDdxp6o&t=72.52s)]
*  and the president does and still believe that the manner in which they are defending themselves [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XutVDdxp6o&t=78.64s)]
*  against the Hamas threat needs to change. White House officials want to see concrete [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XutVDdxp6o&t=84.32s)]
*  steps Israel can take to alleviate suffering in Gaza and they say Israel has hours, maybe [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XutVDdxp6o&t=89.55999999999999s)]
*  days to cough it up. Martha. Okay, Peter, thank you very much. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XutVDdxp6o&t=94.6s)]
