# Israel readies major ground invasion in eastern Rafah as evacuations underway
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [May 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8)
*  former FBI Special Agent and Navy SEAL Jonathan Gilliam. Jonathan, we've been waiting on this [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=0.0s)]
*  expected RAFA offensive for months now based upon all the reporting, based upon just logic trying [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=4.96s)]
*  to move individuals to a humanitarian zone. It feels like it is imminent. What do you make of [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=10.32s)]
*  the timing? Why now? Well, I think, I mean, it could be a couple things. There could be [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  intelligence about the different hostages that are still being held in that particular area. It [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=21.68s)]
*  could be about the 1,000, they estimate 1,000 Hamas soldiers that are in that area and what [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=26.24s)]
*  they could be particularly planning themselves. But I think more than anything, I think it's just [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=34.64s)]
*  time, Todd. I think the tactics and the strategy that Israel is trying to accomplish, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=39.76s)]
*  they're having to potentially move forward quicker, or this just may be the time that [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=48.64s)]
*  they've decided that they need to go into that area. But right now the pressure is on, I believe, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=54.4s)]
*  as you're starting to see across these campuses and social media and media in general, the pressure [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  is on for Israel to get through this and wrap it up, especially with the talks that just are breaking [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=66.96s)]
*  down because Hamas and Israel can't come to terms with what they want. Do you read anything into [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=73.6s)]
*  this with regard to the fate of the hostages? Well, we know that there's been a number of [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=79.04s)]
*  hostages that they have intelligence on that have died in captivity. Not sure if they were [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  killed or if they just died from exposure and just being neglected or from their injuries, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=92.56s)]
*  but a number of them have died. It's an incredibly long time since October 7th when they were taken. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=98.0s)]
*  So, the potential of a lot of these hostages having passed is there. I mean, it could be the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  case that, again, that they have intelligence and they need to move quickly on it, but I don't [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  believe that's what the case is. I think that this is a strategic move and that they're going to go [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=120.72s)]
*  in and eliminate Hamas and try to do that as quickly as possible. We reported that the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=127.36s)]
*  IDF has been in talks with Lloyd Austin, so obviously it's now time for the Biden administration [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=135.28s)]
*  to respond. How should they respond, Jonathan, and how will they respond? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=140.64000000000001s)]
*  I think they should be giving Israel the support they need to get these things done quickly. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=147.52s)]
*  Everybody forgets because they're so involved in the politics of this, including the Biden [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=153.44s)]
*  administration. They forget that Israel was attacked on the 7th and that they've been attacked over and [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=157.36s)]
*  over again over years and years, and now it's come down to this. And while the Biden administration [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=163.6s)]
*  may have their politics, they should realize that the quicker that Israel goes in and eliminates [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=171.84s)]
*  Hamas and the stronghold that Hamas has in these neighborhoods where these people live, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=178.79999999999998s)]
*  which Hamas uses to their advantage, the faster that Israel can evacuate these people, go in and [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=184.64s)]
*  take out these Hamas fighters, the faster this entire situation can be resolved because then [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=190.72s)]
*  the bargaining power that Hamas has over them, besides the fact that they have hostages, will [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=196.56s)]
*  also be resolved. Okay, so after this RAFA offensive, where does the war go from there? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=202.72s)]
*  What do you think is next based upon your experience as a Navy SEAL and being a warfighter yourself? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=209.12s)]
*  Well, it's difficult in that environment because you have to realize that Hamas and Hezbollah have [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=214.88s)]
*  almost a limitless amount of supplies coming from Iran. As long as Iran can get the supplies and get [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=223.51999999999998s)]
*  the funding to Hamas, then they will continue their offenses and their ability to wage war. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=229.2s)]
*  I would expect that Israel has looked at how to stop that. Once they get enough of the Hamas [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=238.72s)]
*  soldiers eliminated, once they destroy Hamas's ability to move through these tunnels and do [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=244.0s)]
*  overt and covert actions, the next step would be in stopping the movement of supplies and funding [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=249.68s)]
*  and personnel that Iran sponsors and backs into start this entire system of warfare within these [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=256.32s)]
*  communities again. I think that's going to be very vital past the ground offensive, is that if they [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=266.16s)]
*  can stop the individual or Hamas from replenishing their people and the equipment, that's going to be [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=272.56s)]
*  vital to the next part of this conflict. I mean, we are all watching any moment now for this offensive [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=279.2s)]
*  to begin. Jonathan Gilliam, we appreciate your time kicking us off here on a Monday morning as we await [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=285.52s)]
*  this, what is going to be the next stage in this war. Jonathan, thank you. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsm53bWryL8&t=290.56s)]
