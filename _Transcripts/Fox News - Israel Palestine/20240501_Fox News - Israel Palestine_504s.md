# Columbia student ridiculed for 'humanitarian aid' request: 'You're the victim!?'
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [May 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k)
*  This is a live look right now at the anti-Israel encampment at UCLA, the school allowing the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=0.0s)]
*  demonstration to continue, similar to Columbia did. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=7.44s)]
*  Here's another look at how things escalated at that Ivy League university after Columbia [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=10.64s)]
*  demanded protesters leave their encampment. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=14.76s)]
*  The demonstrators stormed Hamilton Hall. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=17.6s)]
*  And now we're learning a bit more about those agitators at Columbia, about what happened [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=20.68s)]
*  when they got hungry. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=25.32s)]
*  Here they are trying to smuggle food to their fellow protester comrades. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=27.0s)]
*  Less than 24 hours after taking over a university building, the protesters were asking Columbia [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=30.28s)]
*  for quote, humanitarian aid to continue their anti-Semitic demonstration. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=36.24s)]
*  Why should the university be obligated to provide food to people who have taken over [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=42.44s)]
*  a building? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=49.44s)]
*  Well, first of all, we're saying that they're obligated to provide food to students who [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=50.44s)]
*  pay for a meal plan here. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=55.36s)]
*  But you mentioned that there was a request to have food and water be brought in. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=56.800000000000004s)]
*  Unless I misunderstood you. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=60.04s)]
*  To allow it to be brought in, I mean, well, I guess it's ultimately a question of what [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=61.040000000000006s)]
*  kind of community and obligation Columbia feels it has to its students. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=64.04s)]
*  Do you want students to die of dehydration and starvation or get severely ill, even if [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=69.04s)]
*  they disagree with you? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  If the answer is no, then you should allow basic, I mean, it's crazy to say because we're [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=75.44s)]
*  on an Ivy League campus, but this is like basic humanitarian aid we're asking for. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=79.88s)]
*  Like, could people please have a glass of water? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=83.36s)]
*  But they did put themselves in that very deliberately in that situation and in that position. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=85.80000000000001s)]
*  So it seems like you're sort of saying we want to be revolutionaries, we want to take [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=92.72s)]
*  up this building, now would you please bring us food and water? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=96.92s)]
*  Nobody's asking them to bring anything. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=100.56s)]
*  We're asking them to not violently stop us from bringing in basic humanitarian aid. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=103.2s)]
*  They're stopping the delivery of food? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=108.08000000000001s)]
*  We are looking for a commitment. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=110.52000000000001s)]
*  Harris, that is rich and it would be hilarious if it wasn't so patently offensive. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=112.88s)]
*  They don't want someone to violently stop us from eating and drinking water, but they're [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  calling for violence against Jews. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=122.19999999999999s)]
*  They are demonstrating violence against Jews. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=124.24s)]
*  They want to have basic food and water. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=126.61999999999999s)]
*  What about the hostages that Hamas still has under their control? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=128.82s)]
*  What about the Jewish students? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=131.6s)]
*  They didn't let go to class. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=132.84s)]
*  They don't care. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=134.04s)]
*  They are calling for their extermination. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=135.04s)]
*  I'm supposed to care if they get thirsty? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=136.64s)]
*  Yeah, they don't care about anybody but themselves. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=138.32s)]
*  I've never seen anybody though say that they want to advocate, and the number is closer [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=140.84s)]
*  to 2.7 million on Gaza, that Hamas was not feeding or giving water to. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=144.32s)]
*  I mean, they have turned themselves into the people in Gaza before October 7th. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=148.28s)]
*  They have become the Hamas citizens. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=154.0s)]
*  By the way, I don't believe that 72% of them really support Hamas. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=155.72s)]
*  I think they have guns to their heads and the women are getting raped on that side of [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=158.76s)]
*  the line too. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=161.56s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=162.56s)]
*  Let's be real about it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=163.56s)]
*  So, you've got a group of people now on a campus where to get in you've got to be pretty [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=164.56s)]
*  smart. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  She sounds smart. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=170.52s)]
*  She sounds manipulative and hateful. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=171.72s)]
*  Like I hate everybody and you've got to feed me. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=174.04000000000002s)]
*  I'm willing to carry the signs for whatever against Jews but you've got to feed me. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=176.88000000000002s)]
*  And by the way, we know that there is money flowing from either dirty NGOs or corrupt [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=182.76000000000002s)]
*  money coming from really rich folk like Alexander Soros who's taken over for Dad George. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=188.8s)]
*  I mean, we know that actblue.com has played a role in some of the demonstrations taking [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=194.12s)]
*  over bridges and the such in the last few weeks and months. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=199.0s)]
*  So the question then becomes you saw when we showed that video with the tent, you see [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=203.88s)]
*  all the food that's down there, right? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=206.76000000000002s)]
*  You don't think they're paying for that food. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=208.56s)]
*  They have musical performances that are happening. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=209.96s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=211.88s)]
*  They're not paying for that. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=212.88s)]
*  They've got tents that they sell that have like a little like faux shelving inside where [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=214.16s)]
*  you can pack stuff and sleep in a tent for six weeks. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=218.36s)]
*  I will tell you, I heard all I needed to hear on Monday night on another network. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=221.36s)]
*  A student from UT Austin said, we are being brutalized by the police. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=226.04000000000002s)]
*  We are being brutalized. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=232.0s)]
*  And I thought, you know who really got brutalized? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=233.0s)]
*  The young women that attended the Supernova Music Festival on October 7th. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=236.0s)]
*  That is who got brutalized. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=240.88s)]
*  But some of these universities are caving. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=243.32s)]
*  Northwestern, we just learned this morning, Northwestern is caving saying all Palestinian [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=245.16s)]
*  students get a full ride scholarship. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=249.04000000000002s)]
*  All academics that are a Palestinian get full time jobs and full support. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=251.16s)]
*  Northwestern University, caving. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=256.15999999999997s)]
*  What if they're calling for employers now, you know who not to hire, Kaylee and the private [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=257.76s)]
*  doctor? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=261.71999999999997s)]
*  Look, this is appropriating oppression. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  And let's be clear, the oppression is happening because of Hamas. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=264.4s)]
*  People in Gaza who are starving, it's happening because of Hamas and their actions. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=267.04s)]
*  But this person complaining that she needs a glass of water, they're at risk of dehydration [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=270.58s)]
*  and they need humanitarian aid. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=275.28s)]
*  I don't know who needs to hear this. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=276.84s)]
*  You're at an Ivy League campus where you pay $65,000 plus to go there. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=278.48s)]
*  You are not in Gaza and you are distracting from the very cause you purport to represent. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=282.52000000000004s)]
*  You're not helping the people of Gaza. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=287.6s)]
*  You're complaining about water. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=289.56s)]
*  Instead ship water to Gaza. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=291.0s)]
*  Find a way to help people instead of complaining that you're the victim. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=292.8s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=295.68s)]
*  And Brian, despite all the chaos, violence and hate we've seen recently at these campuses [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=296.68s)]
*  across the country, one moment, however, yesterday gave us some hope. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=300.56s)]
*  Students at the University of North Carolina restored an American flag that had been [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=304.36s)]
*  replaced with a Palestinian flag by anti-Semitic pro-Hamas protesters. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=308.32s)]
*  Alright, so that was a good response because Chapel Hill hasn't been too encouraging from [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=338.32s)]
*  what we saw. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=361.88s)]
*  So those kids are still patriotic. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=362.92s)]
*  I also thought it was great the NYPD took the flag off of, they switched flags, put [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=365.0s)]
*  the Palestinian flag up at City College. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=369.20000000000005s)]
*  So I like the NYPD went down there and flipped it on their own. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=371.36s)]
*  Unfortunately the Palestinian flag is still over George Washington's face at George Washington [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=374.72s)]
*  University which is a joke. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=378.48s)]
*  Now for that girl who dresses up like she went into Yasser Arafat's closet and grabbed [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=379.68s)]
*  his best stuff because he's not using it anymore, she should be ashamed of herself. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=384.6s)]
*  Just think about her rationing. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=388.44000000000005s)]
*  She honestly believes it's our job after you go ahead and break and enter into a building [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=389.8s)]
*  for us to feed you, but it's appropriate they're using a dumb waiter system where they drop [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=394.68s)]
*  a basket down and then pull it up because it's pretty dumb and in the end they got blown [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=398.84000000000003s)]
*  out and they got arrested. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=403.6s)]
*  Sadly, according to Annie McCarthy, they're not going to do any jail time. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=405.32s)]
*  Everybody that took that building will not do any jail time. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=408.76s)]
*  Yeah, Emily, I want to ask you to speak to that because you know the law, why? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=411.52s)]
*  I mean I think we all know the answer because there's no enforcement of the law is what [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=415.92s)]
*  whatsoever. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6EWSuj2g3k&t=419.72s)]
