*  It's taken the Israelis a number of days to confirm this news [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSynPwaFkv0&t=29.42s)]
*  But we've heard not only from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSynPwaFkv0&t=32.86s)]
*  But also from the country's defense minister [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSynPwaFkv0&t=36.46s)]
*  Yoav Galant who is scheduled to meet tomorrow in Washington with US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin now Netanyahu today [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSynPwaFkv0&t=38.42s)]
*  Addressing the public asking do you remember when your country was called the pearl of the Middle East? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSynPwaFkv0&t=45.78s)]
*  Speaking to the Lebanese public he wants to put as much internal pressure on Hezbollah as possible as the ground operation [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSynPwaFkv0&t=51.42s)]
*  Against this Iran-backed Shia militia continues and we also know the airstrikes are still targeting the Lebanese capital of Beirut [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSynPwaFkv0&t=57.82s)]
*  Now this has not been a quiet day for the Israelis either [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSynPwaFkv0&t=65.42s)]
*  We also understand that Hezbollah rocket fire continues in a number of areas along the northern border between Israel and Lebanon [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSynPwaFkv0&t=68.7s)]
*  Earlier today more than a hundred Hezbollah rockets rained down on the city of Haifa where we were reporting from right now and [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSynPwaFkv0&t=76.62s)]
*  Earlier this week we were at the site of one impact to show you what the damage is like when one of these rockets [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSynPwaFkv0&t=83.26s)]
*  slips past missile defense take a look [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSynPwaFkv0&t=88.82000000000001s)]
*  There was just a rocket barrage fired by Hezbollah at Israel's third largest city of Haifa [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSynPwaFkv0&t=91.82000000000001s)]
*  one of those rockets slipping past Israel's missile defense system the Iron Dome and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSynPwaFkv0&t=97.78s)]
*  Slamming into the intersection behind me right now first responders are on the scene [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSynPwaFkv0&t=102.78s)]
*  They're checking to see if anyone was injured, but it's quite a chaotic moment for this city [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSynPwaFkv0&t=107.62s)]
*  One of the first times that a Hezbollah rocket has hit in this part of Israel [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSynPwaFkv0&t=113.06s)]
*  Since the round of conflict began [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSynPwaFkv0&t=119.18s)]
*  I was working in my house. I was sitting down and then bam there is an alarm and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSynPwaFkv0&t=121.18s)]
*  How how can I raise kids here? How can and I think about people on the other side how can they? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSynPwaFkv0&t=128.42000000000002s)]
*  Raise killed kids there [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSynPwaFkv0&t=135.02s)]
*  With the exchange of fire that continues along the northern front [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSynPwaFkv0&t=137.86s)]
*  There are still major questions about how the Israelis are going to respond directly against Iran for that ballistic missile attack last week [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSynPwaFkv0&t=141.42000000000002s)]
*  The Israelis say everything is on the table and local media just minutes ago is reporting that the country's Prime Minister [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSynPwaFkv0&t=149.42000000000002s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu is urging his defense minister Joav Gallant not to go to Washington as tension rises across the region John [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSynPwaFkv0&t=156.06s)]
