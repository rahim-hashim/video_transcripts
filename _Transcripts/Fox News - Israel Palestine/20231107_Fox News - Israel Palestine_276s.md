# Israeli military takes over Hamas stronghold in northern Gaza
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc)
*  First, we begin with breaking news out of the Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=0.0s)]
*  Israeli forces say they have taken control of a Hamas stronghold in the northern part [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=3.2600000000000002s)]
*  of the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=7.18s)]
*  And the United States is planning to send $320 million in precision bombs to Israel. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=8.18s)]
*  As today marks one month since Hamas carried out its brutal attack, Trey Yanks is live [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=14.44s)]
*  on the ground in southern Israel with the very latest. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=19.06s)]
*  Trey, good morning. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=21.54s)]
*  Yeah, hey, Todd Carley, good morning. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=22.54s)]
*  It's been exactly one month since Hamas militants crossed into southern Israel, slaughtering [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=26.2s)]
*  around 1,400 people. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=30.86s)]
*  Today though, the Israelis are taking the fight back to Hamas. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=33.08s)]
*  They continue gaining more territory inside the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=36.16s)]
*  I do want to just show you what it looks like behind me, the level of destruction growing [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=39.08s)]
*  throughout Gaza as the Israelis continue their airstrikes, artillery strikes and ground operations. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=42.64s)]
*  We do understand that over the past day, the Israelis secured a Hamas stronghold in the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=48.4s)]
*  Strip. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=53.4s)]
*  There are anti-tank guided missiles there, launchers, other weapons and other material [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=54.4s)]
*  inside this compound. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=58.72s)]
*  Arab media does report that the Israelis now control the road inside Gaza that goes along [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=60.6s)]
*  the Mediterranean Sea, an indication that they are within a mile of Al-Shifa Hospital, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=66.62s)]
*  the place expected to be where they will find more of a Hamas stronghold, an area where [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=71.36s)]
*  they've released information about a tunnel entrance and network underneath Gaza City. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=77.12s)]
*  All of this is taking place as the ground operations continue, the Israelis using those [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=82.32s)]
*  airstrikes to support their forces. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  But they've also uncovered some interesting evidence of what's taking place inside Gaza. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=89.44s)]
*  This video here shows you different rocket launching units belonging to Palestinian Islamic [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=95.6s)]
*  Jihad, the second largest faction inside Gaza. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=100.24s)]
*  And these units were found underneath a mosque and around a civilian area for boy scouts [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=102.8s)]
*  and girl scouts inside Gaza. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=108.44s)]
*  And it just gives you a sense of how the battle inside is being fought from in civilian territory. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=110.24s)]
*  I do want you to listen to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who spoke with ABC News [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=115.52s)]
*  about the situation on the ground and the plans for Israel. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=119.88s)]
*  As far as tactical little pauses here and there, we've had them before. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=123.83999999999999s)]
*  I suppose we'll check the circumstances in order to enable goods, humanitarian goods, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=128.4s)]
*  to come in or our hostages, individual hostages, to leave. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=134.88s)]
*  But I don't think there's going to be a general ceasefire. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=138.94s)]
*  I think there's aâ€”the question of a ceasefire, the president himself has said that a ceasefire [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=140.78s)]
*  would be a surrender to Hamas. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=146.7s)]
*  No ceasefire. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=149.54s)]
*  That's the position of the Israelis. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=152.46s)]
*  They are starting to allow more humanitarian aid to get into the Strip. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=153.8s)]
*  They're facing new pressure from the United States and others to let that aid in and let [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=157.6s)]
*  more civilians get south of Gaza City, where much of the action and battles are taking [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=161.54s)]
*  place. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=166.18s)]
*  We know today that more civilians have been able to go on the Saladin Road that cuts through [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=167.18s)]
*  the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=171.1s)]
*  The Israelis are facilitating that corridor to get more civilians out. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=172.1s)]
*  Guys? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=175.54000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and, Trey, over the weekend, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who's in Tokyo [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=176.54000000000002s)]
*  right now meeting with G7 leaders, but he met with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=179.98000000000002s)]
*  Abbas, and he said, listen, after this war is over, we want the Palestinian Authority [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=184.46s)]
*  to play a central role in what happens next in Gaza. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=189.62s)]
*  How do you think that is being read by Palestinians in the West Bank? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=194.48s)]
*  And also, is Israel on the same page with that game plan? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=198.0s)]
*  That's a great question, and that interview was illuminating. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=204.23999999999998s)]
*  It really showed that the Israelis may be saying something publicly, but privately be [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=206.79999999999998s)]
*  planning something else. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=210.32s)]
*  They're likely to hold territory inside the Gaza Strip for an undisclosed amount of time [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=211.76s)]
*  until they're able to stabilize the security situation inside Gaza, then at which point [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=217.04s)]
*  there could be other outside actors or the Palestinian Authority that get involved to [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=222.8s)]
*  try and determine who will rule the Gaza Strip after Hamas. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=227.08s)]
*  But it's an incredibly challenging scenario for Israel. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=231.12s)]
*  They understand that if they occupy Gaza, they will face a growing insurgency against [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=233.96s)]
*  their forces. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=238.36s)]
*  In the past, they have done this, and it has been incredibly challenging to do. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=239.64s)]
*  And one thing we should note here, there are more than a million Palestinians internally [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=243.2s)]
*  displaced inside Gaza. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=246.36s)]
*  We saw the Gaza Strip from the inside over the weekend, and many of those homes are destroyed. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=248.18s)]
*  They will have nowhere to return to. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=252.52s)]
*  So you have a major humanitarian crisis that's developing, and it's something that will [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=254.04000000000002s)]
*  last for years, because there will be rebuilding efforts that need to go on, and that will [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=258.12s)]
*  need money and support from the international community. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=262.36s)]
*  Without question, a lot of unknowns and a lot of concern still hanging over this entire [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=264.68s)]
*  situation one month into this brutal war. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=269.12s)]
*  Trey Yanks, live for us in southern Israel, thank you so much. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccd3OcS78Zc&t=272.24s)]
