# Elise Stefanik says she was left 'shocked' by Harvard, MIT, UPenn's response to this
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg)
*  Welcome back America. We have with us Representative Elise Stefanik, who's really become a superstar [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=0.0s)]
*  as far as I'm concerned, House Republican Conference chair on the Armed Services Committee [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=8.3s)]
*  from New York. Elise Stefanik, the House Republicans in the Education Committee held a very important [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=13.64s)]
*  hearing. I noticed they haven't done it in the Senate yet under Schumer. And that is [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=21.72s)]
*  to get to the bottom of what the hell's going on on these campuses and universities [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=25.44s)]
*  with this virulent anti-Semitism and Jew hatred that reminds one of almost Kristallnacht, where [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=29.8s)]
*  people are marching around talking about exterminating Jews. People are hiding in their dorms rooms [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=39.0s)]
*  and in their libraries. People are afraid, Jews, from going to class to their dorm rooms [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=45.72s)]
*  and so forth and so on. So you bring in the president of Harvard, the president of University [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=51.13999999999999s)]
*  of Pennsylvania, the president of MIT. And what happened? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=56.339999999999996s)]
*  They failed on the global stage, Mark. What will go down in congressional history as the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=60.379999999999995s)]
*  most viewed congressional testimony in the history of the United States Congress, three [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=65.53999999999999s)]
*  university presidents could not answer correctly the question, does calling for the genocide [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=70.42s)]
*  of Jews violate their university's code of conduct when it comes to bullying and harassment? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=75.58s)]
*  I asked the question in such a way that it would and should have been an easy yes, but [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=81.25999999999999s)]
*  not a single university president answered it correctly. Instead, their answers dehumanized [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=85.9s)]
*  the Jewish people. The answers reeked of anti-Semitism. The answers even went so far as to say, well, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=92.74s)]
*  it has to move to conduct or action. And I followed up with, you mean the act of committing [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=98.94s)]
*  genocide? So the world saw over one billion views of that heinous testimony. And the only [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=104.74s)]
*  option, Mark, is not only for those three university presidents to be fired because [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=111.61999999999999s)]
*  they don't deserve the dignity of resignation, but we need to have and we launched a thorough [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=116.86s)]
*  congressional investigation of not only those universities, but others as well that have [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=122.97999999999999s)]
*  allowed anti-Semitism to run rampant on these college campuses. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=128.8s)]
*  And we have example after example of threats of violence, of violence, of people being [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=135.06s)]
*  scared and so forth and so on. You know, Elise Stefanik, you're not Jewish. You're what [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=138.76000000000002s)]
*  I call a righteous gentile. And in this context, I ask you this question. If it wasn't Jewish [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=145.36s)]
*  students, if it was some other minority group, do you believe the president of Harvard, who [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=152.84s)]
*  you questioned and who was outrageous, do you believe she would have sat there and said, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=159.84s)]
*  we need acts. It depends on the context, this, that and the other. Do you believe that's [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=165.0s)]
*  how Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania and MIT would conduct themselves under different [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=170.24s)]
*  circumstances? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=174.92000000000002s)]
*  There is no question, Mark, that had any other group, any other minority group be put in [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=176.52s)]
*  that question, they would have answered it very differently without any hesitation. They [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=182.44s)]
*  would have said, yes, of course it violates the code of conduct when it comes to bullying [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=187.68s)]
*  and harassment. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  And that itself is telling, again, it's the double standard. It's the dehumanization of [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=193.42000000000002s)]
*  the Jewish people. And you're right, I'm not Jewish, but I have grown up with many Jewish [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=199.24s)]
*  friends. I went to Harvard Hillel as early as my freshman year. It shocked me that the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=203.8s)]
*  president of Harvard had not been to Harvard Hillel until after the Hamas terrorist attacks [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=208.96s)]
*  against Israel. And she was dean of the undergrads at Harvard for years and had been at Harvard [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=214.51999999999998s)]
*  for decades. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=219.6s)]
*  So this anti-Semitism is inexcusable, but it needs to be rooted out at its core in these [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=220.92s)]
*  ivory towers. It has poisoned the ivory towers and higher education broadly. And the amount [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=227.83999999999997s)]
*  that we have heard from Jewish students who are rightfully fearful for their safety and [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=234.04s)]
*  security, who feel that they cannot pursue their academic pursuits, who cannot go home [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=238.88s)]
*  safely to their dorms because of harassment and threats of assault from university officials, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=243.79999999999998s)]
*  i.e. proctors at Harvard, it is inexcusable and there needs to be accountability and there [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=249.16s)]
*  will be. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=254.64s)]
*  I'll tell you something else that needs to be held accountable, and that's the Biden [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=255.95999999999998s)]
*  administration. I see no urgency. I see no all hands on deck government action. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=259.24s)]
*  I see very little out of the Department of Justice and the Civil Rights Division there. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=266.96s)]
*  I see very little out of the Department of Education and the Civil Rights Division there. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=271.08s)]
*  I see very little out of the Department of Homeland Security. I see no concern about [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=274.64s)]
*  these student visas, where these students are coming from, if people are overstaying [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=279.4s)]
*  their visas. I see no concern about the Hamas network pouring money into these colleges. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=283.64s)]
*  I see no concern about any of this. I don't even hear statements from the Attorney General [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=288.84s)]
*  of the United States or the head of the Civil Rights Division or clear, concise statements [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=294.76s)]
*  by the president or the vice president of the United States without bringing in some [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=300.36s)]
*  other group. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=304.08000000000004s)]
*  Am I missing something? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=305.08000000000004s)]
*  No, you're not missing anything, Mark. There is a fundamental vacuum of leadership on the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=306.08000000000004s)]
*  left and, of course, Joe Biden himself should speak out and condemn and demand for the firing [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=311.56s)]
*  of these three university presidents. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=317.44s)]
*  But the White House should also go a step further and support investigations. And ultimately, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=319.52000000000004s)]
*  a prosecution against, again, this illegal targeting of Jewish students that is happening [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=326.3s)]
*  on these college campuses who are funded with federal funds. Federal funds are pouring into [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=332.76s)]
*  these universities, which we're going to defund higher ed institutions if they allow anti-Semitism [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=338.88s)]
*  to promulgate. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=344.32s)]
*  But this congressional investigation, which was announced by the Republican chairwoman [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=345.32s)]
*  this past week at my urging, we're not going to hesitate to subpoena communications, documents, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=349.8s)]
*  all aspects of how these schools and others have mismanaged this crisis that has been [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=356.92s)]
*  growing for years. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxfulanfQGg&t=361.52000000000004s)]
