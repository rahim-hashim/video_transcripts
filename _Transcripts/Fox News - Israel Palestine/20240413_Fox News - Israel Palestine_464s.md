# LEVIN FROM ISRAEL: The Israeli people are strong
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE)
*  Let's bring in now Mark Levin, host of Life, Liberty and Levin. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=0.0s)]
*  And Mark, thanks for taking time on this unprecedented event. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=4.32s)]
*  Joining us, what can you tell us? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=8.6s)]
*  What is your reaction, your thoughts on what you're seeing play out on our TV screens? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=10.36s)]
*  Well, I'm not watching the TV screen. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=15.8s)]
*  I'm here in Israel and I'm in one of these rooms in a hotel, this is a very strong hotel. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=19.16s)]
*  And I want the American people to understand something. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=27.12s)]
*  Nobody's panicking here. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=30.92s)]
*  These people are very, very strong. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=32.96s)]
*  In fact, I'm sitting here and I am pissed off. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=34.84s)]
*  And I share that view with a lot of people. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=39.56s)]
*  And so people need to understand that there is no panic in this country, at least from [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=43.2s)]
*  what I can see. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=48.94s)]
*  The reason I'm down here in this fortified area now, this hotel, is because the Iron [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=50.26s)]
*  Dome intercepted three or four of these drones over Jerusalem, which is where we are. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=57.739999999999995s)]
*  And they function perfectly. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=65.46s)]
*  But the Israelis' jets are flying around. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=68.18s)]
*  I mean, they have been ready for this. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=71.22s)]
*  They are ready for this. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=73.82s)]
*  The people here are ready for this. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=74.82s)]
*  And one of the things your analysts aren't mentioning, and I'm just saying this as an [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=77.22s)]
*  individual, keep talking about Hezbollah and 150,000 missiles. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=81.25999999999999s)]
*  What do you think Israel would do if Hezbollah shot 150,000 missiles? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=86.82s)]
*  Israel has nuclear weapons. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=93.38s)]
*  I'm not saying they would use them. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=95.3s)]
*  But if they actually fought, their major cities would be obliterated. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=97.46s)]
*  Maybe it's time the enemy starts to worry about what Israel might do. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=102.22s)]
*  This isn't urban warfare like it was with Hamas. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=105.46s)]
*  Israel has an extraordinarily powerful air force. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=108.97999999999999s)]
*  It has a missile system, too. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=111.5s)]
*  It has massive tank capacities. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=113.88s)]
*  It knows what's going on with Hezbollah in the north. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=116.72s)]
*  They're not stupid. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=119.41999999999999s)]
*  If you also notice, what is amazing is these Gulf Arab states, they're not thrown in with [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=120.41999999999999s)]
*  Iran. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=126.94s)]
*  Jordan killed its airspace so the Israelis could go in there and knock out as many of [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=127.94s)]
*  missiles as they could, as well as the United States. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=132.82s)]
*  You haven't heard Peep from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the rest. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=135.7s)]
*  They hate Iran. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=139.61999999999998s)]
*  They hate these terrorists. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=140.94s)]
*  They want them defeated, too. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=144.38s)]
*  They really can't say so. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=146.54s)]
*  But all these intelligence activities are taking place between all these countries. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=148.89999999999998s)]
*  If you really look in the region, it's almost all the Arab countries and the Jewish state [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=153.77999999999997s)]
*  and the United States. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=161.86s)]
*  And then there's Iran and all of these terrorist groups that they funded. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=162.86s)]
*  And the American people need to understand that when Donald Trump was president, Iran [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=168.26000000000002s)]
*  was incapable of doing this. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=172.26000000000002s)]
*  Joe Biden, Blinken, poured over $100 billion into Iran, directly and indirectly, in a failed [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=174.98000000000002s)]
*  appeasement policy. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=182.94000000000003s)]
*  And we have paid for much of what's taking place right now, including with Hezbollah, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=185.82000000000002s)]
*  including with Hamas, including with the Houthis. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=191.54s)]
*  And we have American soldiers and sailors and airmen all in harm's way, magnificent, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=193.57999999999998s)]
*  red-blooded American heroes. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=198.9s)]
*  None of this had to happen. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=202.78s)]
*  None of it. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=204.9s)]
*  I sit here pissed off. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=206.18s)]
*  That's how I am. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=208.1s)]
*  Go right ahead. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=208.9s)]
*  Mark, Jason Chavitz here. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=209.62s)]
*  Please stay safe. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=211.26s)]
*  But, you know, President Biden said don't. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=212.26s)]
*  That was his message. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=215.26s)]
*  And it's been his message for a long time. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=216.26s)]
*  Don't. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=217.98s)]
*  Do you think that's actually working? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=219.14s)]
*  Is that resonating? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=220.5s)]
*  Well, my show that was supposed to air, yeah, look at it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=222.82s)]
*  It's really had a great effect. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=226.5s)]
*  General Keene, I don't know if it'll air Sunday or not, he said something that was extraordinary. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=228.78s)]
*  His contacts in the? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=234.26s)]
*  some commandants, that's who coordinates with the Israelis and the others in the Middle [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=235.38s)]
*  East on our behalf. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=239.98s)]
*  He said they recommended multiple times to the White House, to the State Department, that [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=241.94s)]
*  they hit Iran, that they hit their refineries, that they hit their some of their missile [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=248.74s)]
*  sites and so forth in response to these endless terrorist attacks against our troops, against [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=254.46s)]
*  Israel and so forth, to push them back, that they know the mentality of the Iranians when [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=259.94s)]
*  they are slapped and slapped down hard. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=265.06s)]
*  They quiet down for a while. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=268.22s)]
*  But instead, what the Biden administration has done is they've attacked our ally openly, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=270.1s)]
*  repeatedly, obsessively, publicly. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=276.34s)]
*  They have threatened to cut off arms. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=279.85999999999996s)]
*  As far as I know, they don't even have all the Iron Dome missiles because they were starting [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=281.41999999999996s)]
*  to slow walk some of these. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=285.14s)]
*  They were investigating the Israeli company that provides an essential part for the Iron [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=286.78s)]
*  Dome. Joe Biden is a ping pong ball. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=292.21999999999997s)]
*  He says, I support Israel. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=295.21999999999997s)]
*  But what does Israel decide? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=296.85999999999996s)]
*  You know, we've had enough of this. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=298.14s)]
*  We cannot allow our citizens to keep running the basements every three days and they keep [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=299.85999999999996s)]
*  picking off our people left and right. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=304.21999999999997s)]
*  You're right. Hezbollah has one hundred fifty thousand missiles. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=306.5s)]
*  We're just supposed to sit here with the United States. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=309.29999999999995s)]
*  Sit here. I suspect what the Biden team is trying to figure out is how to how to keep [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=311.38s)]
*  a rein on Israel. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=316.34s)]
*  And what the Israelis are trying to figure out is how do we respond to this? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=317.85999999999996s)]
*  Well, we have to keep looking over our shoulder. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=321.58s)]
*  I think that's the big issue. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=323.9s)]
*  Your experts have been fantastic. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=325.82s)]
*  Some have said it's going to be limited. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=327.53999999999996s)]
*  Some have said this is a first way. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=330.58s)]
*  We don't know. I suspect the Israelis in the United States are pretty good at handling [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=332.41999999999996s)]
*  all that. But really look at what Jordan did. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=336.3s)]
*  It shut down its airspace. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=339.74s)]
*  So the United States and Israel could do what it needed to do. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=341.1s)]
*  And you look at how quiet all those Arab countries are. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=344.38s)]
*  They're watching. They're rooting for Israel in the United States. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=348.3s)]
*  Iran is trying to overthrow Jordan. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=351.22s)]
*  Iran has taken over Iraq. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=354.38s)]
*  Iran has taken over Yemen. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=356.86s)]
*  Iran has taken over Lebanon. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=358.98s)]
*  Iran is not interested in a two state solution. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=361.82s)]
*  A five state solution is an Islamist, fundamentalist, fundamentalist regime. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=364.98s)]
*  This is something. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=370.1s)]
*  Biden and Blinken and the other reprobates can't seem to get through their damn heads. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=372.46s)]
*  This is not a war about a two state solution. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=379.02s)]
*  It's a war that's even bigger than Israel. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=383.65999999999997s)]
*  This is a war for the survivability of the planet and whether this planet is going to be mostly free or mostly tyranny. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=386.74s)]
*  And Iran has gotten away with this over and over again. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=395.74s)]
*  And it's too bad that it falls to this little tiny country to try and confront them. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=398.97999999999996s)]
*  And we will see how much Biden supports Israel. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=405.38s)]
*  Oh, he'll support him in the first week or so. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=408.9s)]
*  But we'll see because he is a funny way of showing he says one thing and he does another. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=412.02000000000004s)]
*  And I just want to thank one of the one of the I want to thank the American Armed Forces. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waej2MpHKKE&t=417.74s)]
