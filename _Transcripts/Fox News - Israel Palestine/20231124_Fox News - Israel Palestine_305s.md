# Hamas withholding US hostages for leverage: Former Taliban negotiator
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw)
*  We're going to bring in Adam Bowler right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=0.0s)]
*  He helped negotiate the Abrams Accords and negotiated with the Taliban on behalf of the [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=1.76s)]
*  Trump administration and is the former CEO of the U.S. International Development Finance [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=7.0s)]
*  Corporation. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=12.68s)]
*  So, Adam, this is a recipe with a dash of hope and a heaping amount of distrust. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=13.68s)]
*  As this hostage release is currently unfolding, we heard both Trey Yanks and Alex Hogan report [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=19.2s)]
*  that they have not released another list yet. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=26.8s)]
*  So what's likely taking place behind the scenes right now? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=30.28s)]
*  I think you're having the Qataris actively negotiating back and forth. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=35.68s)]
*  We spent a lot of time with the Qataris directly with both the emir and the individual that [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=40.0s)]
*  was foreign minister and is now prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=44.8s)]
*  They're probably shuttling back and forth quite a bit. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=48.6s)]
*  They have a really difficult task because Hamas is a terrorist organization and they're [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=51.58s)]
*  trying to use leverage, but it is what has brought us to where today is set up where [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=56.28s)]
*  we've released hostages. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=60.92s)]
*  So they've had some diplomatic success. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=62.28s)]
*  Adam, let me dive in here. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=64.76s)]
*  I want to ask about the deal as we understand it and the way it's been constructed. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=66.8s)]
*  Hamas, as Arthel reported, is to release 50 women and children, including three Americans. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=70.88s)]
*  In exchange, Israel is supposed to release about 150 Palestinian women and children. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=76.32s)]
*  I'm just curious, does it behoove Hamas to release all 10 American citizens or is there [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=81.56s)]
*  a concern that they may be holding them back until they get more concessions? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=86.84s)]
*  Think about it this way. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=93.76s)]
*  Hamas is going to use everything they can to have leverage. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=94.76s)]
*  So this deal is all about leverage. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=97.44s)]
*  The reason that we're in this situation is because Israel was strong in the first place. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=99.44s)]
*  So when you think about Hamas holding back Americans, they're holding back Americans [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=103.76s)]
*  so they have leverage over the United States, just like they're doing this in wave over [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=108.04s)]
*  leverage. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=112.36000000000001s)]
*  The other thing I'd note about the Hamas deal, and this gives you a view into Hamas and how [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=113.36000000000001s)]
*  they think, they stopped Israelis from flying drones. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=118.4s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=123.0s)]
*  That's because they want during this time, these four days, to regroup in the south. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=124.08000000000001s)]
*  And so the reason they're doing all of this is for leverage. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=129.0s)]
*  Now, it's good we've got hostages coming back. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=131.48000000000002s)]
*  I agree with it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=134.36s)]
*  I'm happy about it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=135.36s)]
*  But that's why you don't see Americans out there today as leverage over the United States. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=136.48000000000002s)]
*  Adam, I want to read a quote from the Wall Street Journal editorial on the Israel-Hamas [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=139.64000000000001s)]
*  hostages deal. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  It says, quote, even as Israelis rejoice for the women and children who will return home, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  they know Hamas is rejoicing, too. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=155.4s)]
*  Its war crimes have been rewarded. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=158.12s)]
*  So I ask you, was there any other way out of this? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=160.9s)]
*  I think, look, and just to bolt onto what you said, as the prisoners are being released [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=165.8s)]
*  right now, the Palestinian prisoners are being released, you have people chanting Hamas, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=171.36s)]
*  Hamas, Hamas. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=175.4s)]
*  And the right way out, so there's two things that we need to not forget, we've got 200, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=177.24s)]
*  more than 200 other hostages, and Israel's goal is to eradicate Hamas. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  There's no other answer here. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=188.4s)]
*  And so what I think we're going to need to recognize is, in a few days, they're going [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=190.44s)]
*  to need to resume hostilities, and they're going to need to go down south. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=194.24s)]
*  So that's the right way to push and eventually eradicate Hamas here. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=198.24s)]
*  It's the only way. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=202.88s)]
*  I do think the positive thing here is you do see the beginnings of who's going to negotiate [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=203.88s)]
*  an eventual solution in Qatar and Egypt. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=209.44s)]
*  So diplomatic channels are open. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=212.8s)]
*  And so as days go past, as weeks go past here, those are the players that are going to see, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=215.34s)]
*  they're going to try to eventually end this. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=219.2s)]
*  But I don't think it ends without Hamas out of the Gaza Strip. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=221.16s)]
*  Fair to say, a healthy amount of skepticism over the next four days, Adam? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=224.16s)]
*  I think there's actually aligned interest here. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=231.12s)]
*  I think if Hamas pulls out, they're going to get a lot of international community response. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=233.68s)]
*  I think it's going to hurt Israel these next four days. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=238.32s)]
*  They're going to do it because they want the hostages back. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=241.32s)]
*  But I think you're going to see Hamas play around psychologically quite a bit. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  I'm not surprised the list didn't come over. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=247.64s)]
*  They're going to wait. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=250.16s)]
*  They're going to drag. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=251.16s)]
*  There's going to be bumps because it's psychological warfare. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=252.16s)]
*  And Hamas is going to use every piece of leverage they can because that's what they do. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=254.72s)]
*  They're a terrorist organization, and they're very good at rallying international media [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=259.0s)]
*  support. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=263.71999999999997s)]
*  And that's the biggest issue for Israel right now. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  Over these next few days, international media is going to push, the community is going to [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=267.15999999999997s)]
*  push for them to not resume. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=272.44s)]
*  And they can't not do that. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=274.76s)]
*  That's what Hamas is planning on and why they're doing this in the first place. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=276.3s)]
*  More, boy, this is a long road ahead indeed here. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=280.14s)]
*  Adam Bowler, thank you very much for your analysis on this. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9b9JfFQQw&t=285.22s)]
