# Martha MacCallum: I witnessed the darkest evil that can exist
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU)
*  There was also this Martha that I just want to give people a chance to hear from you [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=0.0s)]
*  I don't know you had a tweet after you went to a screening event [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=4.36s)]
*  I don't need to we can put up the tweet [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=7.84s)]
*  But just let Martha explain what you saw when you went to the consulate last week [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  So on Friday a number of reporters were invited to the Israeli consulate to view [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  The video of the Hamas attack on October 7th [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=20.36s)]
*  Everyone has seen some of these images online [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=25.52s)]
*  But the unfiltered video is absolutely [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=28.74s)]
*  It's it's so horrific [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=33.98s)]
*  It's hard to put into words and we've had our reporters Trey Yanks and Mike Tobin have also watched it and and had a similar [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=36.019999999999996s)]
*  Feeling but you know that there is obviously so much blood so many charred bodies [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=42.86s)]
*  It's very difficult obviously to watch this but the things the two things that stuck with me Dana more than anything is [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=49.0s)]
*  A moment when two young boys, they're probably eight and ten a [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=57.26s)]
*  grenade is thrown into the room where they are with their father and [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=62.66s)]
*  their father's killed and then the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=67.66s)]
*  terrorists the Hamas terrorists pulls the boys out and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=70.7s)]
*  basically pushes them into their kitchen and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=74.86s)]
*  They're crying one of them can't see from the grenade and [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=78.74000000000001s)]
*  The terrorists starts drinking water or milk or juice out of their refrigerator and standing in their kitchen [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=82.5s)]
*  these boys are [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=89.86s)]
*  screaming and they one of them says I want my mother and [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=92.58s)]
*  Then he says why am I alive? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=98.25999999999999s)]
*  It's a very [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=102.89999999999999s)]
*  I will never forget this boys these two boys [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=104.94s)]
*  I just can't imagine so beyond the blood and the horror is the emotion of [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=108.78s)]
*  I don't know if they survived right but of the survivors and the other thing that haunts [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=116.06s)]
*  Will haunt anyone who hears it or sees it are the phone calls? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=122.18s)]
*  There's a Hamas terrorist who calls his parents and they have a recording of it because it was on a phone [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=126.2s)]
*  That I think was left there or belonged to one of the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=131.9s)]
*  victims and he says [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=135.42000000000002s)]
*  Mom and dad you will be so proud of me. I'm a hero. I killed ten Jews with my own hands and [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=137.57999999999998s)]
*  his parents are cheering and [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=144.73999999999998s)]
*  Saying that they wish they were with him [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=147.61999999999998s)]
*  It is it is it's horrifying and I think that the reason obviously that they're showing it to people [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=150.5s)]
*  They don't want this part of this story to be forgotten, right? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=156.1s)]
*  And it is important to remember what what what the spark was these people in in [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=158.66s)]
*  The Palestinian territory would not be under attack right now and it's horrific what is happening to their families as well [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=164.98s)]
*  But this attack would not be happening if it weren't for what happened on October 7th [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=171.33999999999997s)]
*  So it's important that we were well [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=175.89999999999998s)]
*  It's critical to as reporters to be the eyes and ears for others and you went through a really traumatic thing to see it [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=177.14s)]
*  But thankfully you were the witness and you can share it with all of us and we thank you for that. Thank you [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to1xmSW4ybU&t=183.22s)]
