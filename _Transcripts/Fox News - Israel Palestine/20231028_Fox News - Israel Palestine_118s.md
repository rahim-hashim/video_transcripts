# Pro-Palestine protests break out in Lebanon over Israel-Hamas war
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gmd8uW2dj4A)
*  Major worry is this all turning into a two-front war against both Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gmd8uW2dj4A&t=0.0s)]
*  in Lebanon. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gmd8uW2dj4A&t=8.08s)]
*  And in some places along Israel's northern border with Lebanon, fighting has already [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gmd8uW2dj4A&t=9.08s)]
*  been ongoing for several days. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gmd8uW2dj4A&t=13.56s)]
*  Team Fox coverage continues with Steve Harrigan live in northern Israel. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gmd8uW2dj4A&t=16.12s)]
*  Good evening, Steve. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gmd8uW2dj4A&t=21.02s)]
*  Good evening, Jonathan. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gmd8uW2dj4A&t=22.02s)]
*  It already is in many senses a two-front war. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gmd8uW2dj4A&t=25.02s)]
*  The fighting between Hezbollah in Lebanon and Israeli forces in the north of Israel [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gmd8uW2dj4A&t=27.76s)]
*  has been going on for the past three weeks, but it's been at a fairly low and contained [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gmd8uW2dj4A&t=32.28s)]
*  level. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gmd8uW2dj4A&t=37.68s)]
*  The real question is, is that going to explode even further or not? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gmd8uW2dj4A&t=38.68s)]
*  Over the past 24 hours, Hezbollah fired a multitude of attacks into Israel, setting [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gmd8uW2dj4A&t=42.32s)]
*  off alarms in different parts of the country. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gmd8uW2dj4A&t=47.68000000000001s)]
*  They fired a guided missile, which was intercepted by Israel. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gmd8uW2dj4A&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  They fired rocket attacks, and they fired anti-tank missiles into Israel as well. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gmd8uW2dj4A&t=53.48s)]
*  Israel has responded on multiple times, not only intercepting the missile, but using attack [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gmd8uW2dj4A&t=59.68s)]
*  drones to destroy what they say was a terrorist cell. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gmd8uW2dj4A&t=64.32s)]
*  That's Hezbollah fighters who were firing missiles. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gmd8uW2dj4A&t=68.12s)]
*  So the back and forth has been going on, and protests too in the region as well as anger [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gmd8uW2dj4A&t=70.56s)]
*  continues to swell. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gmd8uW2dj4A&t=76.28s)]
*  More protests in Lebanon about what is going on in Gaza and real concern in Lebanon for [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gmd8uW2dj4A&t=78.0s)]
*  the plight of the civilians inside of Gaza. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gmd8uW2dj4A&t=85.12s)]
*  So far, as far as deaths go on each side, 47 Hezbollah fighters killed, six Israeli [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gmd8uW2dj4A&t=88.34s)]
*  soldiers killed, and the concern continues as to will this be a more active front in [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gmd8uW2dj4A&t=94.16s)]
*  this war. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gmd8uW2dj4A&t=99.1s)]
*  Jonathan. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gmd8uW2dj4A&t=100.1s)]
*  Steve Harrigan in northern Israel tonight. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gmd8uW2dj4A&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  Thank you so much, Steve. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gmd8uW2dj4A&t=104.53999999999999s)]
