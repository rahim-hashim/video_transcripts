# Netanyahu spokeswoman: This is our red line
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [March 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y)
*  Welcome back to Sunday Night in America. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Obama had a red line in Syria, which turned out to be more magenta or light pink. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=2.3000000000000003s)]
*  Now Biden has a red line, but not for Hamas, not for the Palestinians, not even for Iran. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=8.6s)]
*  Biden has a red line for Israel. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=14.68s)]
*  Biden seems to be conditioning support for Israel and access to U.S. weapons on whether [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=17.52s)]
*  Israel continues moving into southern Gaza. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=22.84s)]
*  So was October the 7th really that long ago? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=26.68s)]
*  Has Hamas been eliminated? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=29.96s)]
*  Or is Biden looking at the polls, which indicate young people don't like his policies in the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=32.5s)]
*  Middle East? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  Joining us is Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu spokesperson Tal Heinrich. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=38.96s)]
*  Welcome back, Tal. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=43.56s)]
*  It's so good to see you. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=44.56s)]
*  The U.S. and Israel have a deep and lasting relationship. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=45.56s)]
*  I wonder, has Biden communicated a red line to Netanyahu? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=48.96s)]
*  And if so, why did he feel the need to make it public? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=53.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me on, Trey. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=57.16s)]
*  Good to see you too. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=58.72s)]
*  You see, we have a red line. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=59.72s)]
*  Our prime minister just stated it a few days ago. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=62.28s)]
*  We have a red line that we're not going to leave for Hamas operational battalions in [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=64.88s)]
*  Rafah. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=70.6s)]
*  We've gotten to this point in which we've taken out the majority of Hamas' military [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=71.88s)]
*  capabilities, three quarters of their battalions. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=76.48s)]
*  We're not going to leave the rest of them untouched. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=79.84s)]
*  That's a red line. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=82.96s)]
*  And that's a decision that we took as a nation. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=84.24s)]
*  It's not a prime minister. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=87.47999999999999s)]
*  It's not a war cabinet. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=88.67999999999999s)]
*  It's not the IDF that just took this decision. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=89.72s)]
*  It's a nation that took a decision that we will no longer accept life next to a terror [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  enclave and that October 7th cannot happen again. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=98.08s)]
*  Now, what would happen if these battalions would be left untouched? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=101.47999999999999s)]
*  Hamas will rearm, regroup and attack us again. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  You and I will have this conversation again down the road. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=109.9s)]
*  We cannot allow this to happen. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=113.26s)]
*  This is our red line. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=115.34s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=117.54s)]
*  Let's take a listen to Biden's secretary of state, Tony Blinken, and I'll ask you a question [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=119.54s)]
*  on the other side. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=123.68s)]
*  If there are going to be military operations in Rafah, a clear and implementable plan to [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=125.82s)]
*  get the civilians out of harm's way and to provide for them once out of harm's way. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=131.14s)]
*  We've not seen that plan. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=136.66s)]
*  I won't give you a chance to assure Secretary Blinken that you are just as concerned about [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=139.54s)]
*  civilian casualties as he is. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=146.06s)]
*  I find the lecture to be somewhat interesting from Blinken to Israelis. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=148.78s)]
*  Israelis are surrounded by enemies. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=155.85999999999999s)]
*  But what is Israel doing to limit civilian casualties? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=157.42s)]
*  You see, we have the plans. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=160.85999999999999s)]
*  They were presented to the war cabinet. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=163.1s)]
*  The prime minister has approved the plans for Rafah and they will achieve two goals, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=164.62s)]
*  the elimination of the Hamas battalions there and the evacuation of civilians from the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=168.78s)]
*  fighting zones. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=174.22s)]
*  Once we move forward with the plan, with a strategic plan, we will, of course, take care [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=176.28s)]
*  of the civilian population there. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=182.78s)]
*  There's no question about it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=185.5s)]
*  Before I let you go, Senator Chuck Schumer is apparently not content mismanaging his [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=188.66s)]
*  own country. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=193.28s)]
*  He has some advice for Israel as well. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=194.94s)]
*  I want us to listen together and then I'll ask you a question before we go. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=196.72s)]
*  At this critical juncture, I believe a new election is the only way to allow for a healthy [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=201.28s)]
*  and open decision-making process about the future of Israel. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=209.16s)]
*  Of course, the United States cannot dictate the outcome of an election, nor should we [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=213.4s)]
*  try. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=219.12s)]
*  That is for the Israeli public to decide. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=221.4s)]
*  I think it's pretty spectacular in a really bad way that the Senate Majority Leader is [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=225.56s)]
*  calling for the removal of the head of state of an ally, but I'll give you the last word. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=230.44s)]
*  Trey, Israel is a sovereign nation, of course, we're a democracy, and a democracy, this concept [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=237.12s)]
*  where the citizens choose their own government who leads them. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=243.28s)]
*  And right now, in case someone hasn't noticed, we have a unity government in place, which [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=246.36s)]
*  is reflective, really, of the public sentiment that you really see across Israel. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=250.68s)]
*  Now, the prime minister represents the overwhelming majority of Israelis who reject the notion [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=255.16s)]
*  of a Palestinian terrorist state. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=261.6s)]
*  And the impediment to peace, and I mean real peace, not just empty slogans, is Palestinian [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=263.88s)]
*  terrorism and the refusal to acknowledge that the Jewish state, the state of Israel, is [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=268.96000000000004s)]
*  here to stay. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=273.8s)]
*  After 9-11, you know, President George W. Bush said, either you're with us or you are [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=275.2s)]
*  with a terrorist. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=279.62s)]
*  And 20 years later, we simply ask the same question. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=280.42s)]
*  Are you with us or with the terrorists? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=283.3s)]
*  You're a lot more diplomatic than I am, Tal. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=287.3s)]
*  I think Chuck Schumer is a joke, is a bad joke, and he has no business whatsoever lecturing [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=289.58000000000004s)]
*  any other sovereign nation on who their leader ought to be, especially an ally like Israel. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=296.26s)]
*  But you're more diplomatic than I am. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=301.46000000000004s)]
*  Thank you for joining us on a Sunday night. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=303.66s)]
*  We will have this conversation again, I am sure. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=305.46000000000004s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdYT6O5q64Y&t=308.58000000000004s)]
