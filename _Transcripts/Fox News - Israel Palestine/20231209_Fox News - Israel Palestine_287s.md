# A cease-fire 'means victory' for Hamas: Former Israeli ambassador
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w)
*  For the latest on the fighting in Gaza, let's bring in former Israeli ambassador to the US and former member of the Israeli Knesset, Michael Orin. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. Orin, welcome. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  Good evening to you both. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=8.4s)]
*  Good to be here. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=9.76s)]
*  Fighting intensifying across Gaza. What's the latest from your perspective, sir? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=10.56s)]
*  Well, the fighting is very intense and it's progressing according to schedule. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=15.72s)]
*  But you have to proceed cautiously. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  We cautiously to minimize to the greatest degree possible the damage to the Palestinian civilian population. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=23.48s)]
*  But also to our own soldiers. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=29.68s)]
*  We lost five soldiers today, a particular tragedy for the Israeli people. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=31.36s)]
*  Now, the chief of the IDF, IDF chief of staff is a well-known figure in this country. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=36.12s)]
*  I don't know how many Americans know who the head of the US military is, but here it's a well-known figure. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=40.76s)]
*  Our former chief of staff is Gadi Eisenkot. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=45.8s)]
*  He's also a member of the government. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=48.16s)]
*  He lost his son two days ago in fighting and he lost his nephew today. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=49.44s)]
*  So this is intensely personal for us. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=54.32s)]
*  And so, yes, we want to release these hostages. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=56.92s)]
*  If we can get to them, we want to destroy Hamas. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=60.52s)]
*  We have to destroy Hamas. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=62.4s)]
*  But we also have to keep in mind that our children are out there, literally out there fighting for us. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=63.84s)]
*  And so we have to proceed cautiously. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=70.12s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu this week warned Hezbollah about the danger of all out war with Israel. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=72.12s)]
*  What about the possibility of a two front war? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=78.12s)]
*  It's real. It's real. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=82.16s)]
*  It has been real from day one. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=84.36s)]
*  And I'm not a spokesman for the government and I've been a strong advocate. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=85.68s)]
*  Focusing is really a military might to the north as well, because Hezbollah represents a threat, which is roughly 15 times that of Hamas. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=89.44000000000001s)]
*  Hamas maybe has 10,000 rockets, but Hezbollah has about 150,000 rockets. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=98.08000000000001s)]
*  They are longer range, they're heavier and some of them are quite accurate. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=104.36000000000001s)]
*  They also have a terrorist force, which is about 100,000 strong. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=108.4s)]
*  And for the last decade, they've been busy massacring Syrians. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=112.48s)]
*  They participated in the massacre of a half a million Syrians. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=115.88s)]
*  So if they're doing this to their own people, you can imagine what they do to our people. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=119.28s)]
*  And we have literally 250,000 Israelis who can't return to their homes, both on the border in the south and on the border of the north. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=122.8s)]
*  If we don't address the Hezbollah threat eventually, those people will not be able to go back to their homes in any way. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=131.56s)]
*  And now we know what these terrorists can actually do to our civilians. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=137.4s)]
*  We're going to have to address it at some point. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=140.4s)]
*  And whether we do it now or whether we do it in the future, the situation in the north is completely, totally intolerable. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=143.68s)]
*  You may remember back in 1962, President Kennedy was willing to go to a nuclear war to get rid of missiles in Cuba. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=152.16000000000003s)]
*  All right. Russian missiles. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=157.76000000000002s)]
*  Imagine what it's like for these people facing 150,000 rockets in the hands of a terrorist organization. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=159.08s)]
*  The White House originally said it did not want to limit Israel's response to the Hamas attack. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=164.6s)]
*  More recently, it's been talking about the concern about civilian casualties. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=169.4s)]
*  I'm sure a lot of our audience at home is wondering, is the White House preventing Israel from doing what it needs to do? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=174.0s)]
*  It is not. It is not. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  And then we get sometimes the messages get a little mixed, kind of a good cop, bad cop. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=182.8s)]
*  If you listen to John Kirby's spokesman for the National Security Council, he's very, very supportive. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=186.96s)]
*  Matt Miller, the spokesman for the State Department, very supportive. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=192.36s)]
*  But other people in the administration have come out and said that there have been too many Palestinians killed, which raises questions. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=195.44000000000003s)]
*  What is too many? What is too little? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=201.52s)]
*  From our perspective, even one Palestinian dead is too many. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=203.0s)]
*  But what can we do? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=207.36s)]
*  We're fighting against an enemy who is literally using these people as human shields. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=208.68s)]
*  And that's just not a you know, that's not just a propaganda line. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=212.36s)]
*  Our forces are fighting in Khanunis today. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=215.96s)]
*  It's a city in the south. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=217.92s)]
*  Underneath Khanunis are miles and miles and miles of tunnels. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=219.72s)]
*  And they will be trapped. They're full of arms, full of weapons. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=223.84s)]
*  And we try to move the population away from that area. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=226.96s)]
*  It is very, very difficult. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=231.0s)]
*  Nobody wants to see Palestinian civilian casualties. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=233.56s)]
*  And keep in mind, for us, it's not just a moral issue, it's a strategic issue. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=236.76s)]
*  Because the more Palestinian casualties there are, the more people in the world, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=241.44s)]
*  like you heard in the Security Council, will demand a ceasefire. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=245.64s)]
*  And a ceasefire means victory for Hamas. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=248.56s)]
*  It means that Hamas gets away with mass murder. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=250.84s)]
*  It means those 250,000 Israelis will never be able to go back to their homes. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=253.6s)]
*  So we have every not just a moral interest, we have a strategic interest [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=257.56s)]
*  in holding down as much as possible those civilian casualties. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=261.24s)]
*  Michael Oren, grateful for your time today. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=264.48s)]
*  Thank you so much, sir. Thank you. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqFCHhD8w1w&t=266.36s)]
