# Even the Democrats are saying this about Biden: Harris Faulkner
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU)
*  power panel now. TW Shannon, former Republican speaker of the Oklahoma House of Representatives [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=0.0s)]
*  is here in town in person. David Carlucci, former Democratic New York state senator is [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=5.34s)]
*  here as well. TW, your top line thoughts about what's playing out. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=10.46s)]
*  Well, it seems to me that our president is playing politics with a very important issue. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=14.58s)]
*  We all know that his heart is not in support of Israel. He is much like his predecessor, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=18.38s)]
*  Barack Obama. And frankly, I think they could be almost considered enemies of Israel at [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=22.62s)]
*  this point. The truth is they've abandoned our longstanding support and friendship that [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=27.099999999999998s)]
*  we've had with Israel. Yes, he's talking, he's the most duplicitous president maybe [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=31.38s)]
*  in American history because he's saying one thing, but during politics, he's definitely [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=35.08s)]
*  playing politics during the presidential year, trying to pretend like there's support for [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=38.58s)]
*  Israel. But ultimately, the reason Nate and Yahoo canceled the original meeting is because [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=41.94s)]
*  he knows that the support among Democrats for Israel is waning in a big way. They've [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=46.04s)]
*  abandoned them. And I think it's a mistake long term, not just for Israel, but for the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=50.54s)]
*  American people. All right. This is a debate. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=54.18s)]
*  So you're a robot. Well, I would disagree. I think, of course, anyone would be outraged [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=56.66s)]
*  about what happened to those humanitarian workers that are trying to deliver aid. But [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=61.339999999999996s)]
*  what we see is Biden trying to have peace, trying to move towards a resolution. There's [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=67.1s)]
*  no easy answers here. There's no silver bullet that's going to solve this. Then you juxtapose [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=71.94s)]
*  it to the GOP nominee, Donald Trump. And what is he saying? He's saying just end the war, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=76.78s)]
*  end it soon. No talk about hostages, no talk about how you get there. It looks like Donald [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=82.82s)]
*  Trump is more of a publicity stunt than a foreign policy. If you question and try to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=87.83999999999999s)]
*  get what he actually is going to do, no one can tell you. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=92.02s)]
*  Well, I think we can do what we'd like to do is do what he did when he was in the White [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=94.38s)]
*  House as president of the United States where we didn't have this issue. We didn't have [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=97.36s)]
*  an issue of Hamas reigning terror on Israel like we have right now under Joe Biden. The [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=100.38s)]
*  reason we have that is because the world is a safer place when Israel is strong. Listen, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=104.85999999999999s)]
*  the outrage should be because a terrorist group attacked Israeli citizens on a specific [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=110.02s)]
*  day in October and that needs to be addressed and we need to bring the American citizens [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=115.02s)]
*  home. That's where the outrage should be. The fact that we have Americans still being [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=118.89999999999999s)]
*  held hostage by Hamas. It's an outrage. That's where the hearts of the American people should [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=122.42s)]
*  be. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=127.17999999999999s)]
*  On this very program, we had the parents of one of those Americans being held. He grew [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=128.18s)]
*  up in Long Island, New York, was getting ready to go to Binghamton College and went to take [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=131.42s)]
*  his part in the IDF and got pulled out of a tank by Hamas and has been held ever since. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=136.66s)]
*  I will say this with regard to the hostages though. Why didn't the United States vote [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=141.46s)]
*  no on that UN resolution against that resolution? Why didn't they say no rather than abstain? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=146.9s)]
*  Because it didn't mention the hostages either. It only called for a ceasefire. Why not? That [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=154.54000000000002s)]
*  makes us look, we're not allowed to be neutral. So in TW's words, maybe we're an enemy in [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=159.86s)]
*  that point. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=165.06s)]
*  Absolutely not. Look, the United States is a strong ally of Israel. There's no question [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=166.38s)]
*  about that. Joe Biden is trying to move forward with actually walking the walk, not just talking [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=170.9s)]
*  and sending aid, sending supplies and missiles to Israel to defend itself. That's crystal [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=176.54s)]
*  clear. Then you see just the nitpicking and lobbying stones over from Donald Trump with [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=182.38s)]
*  no clear policy. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=189.38s)]
*  You keep bringing him up. By the way, what he has said, maybe you and I heard it differently, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=190.38s)]
*  what he has said is, yes, he wants the war not to go on in perpetuity, but he also wants [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=193.84s)]
*  them to be able to do what they need to do with Hamas because remember who he took out. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=199.20000000000002s)]
*  Harris, you're right. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  Soleimani. Remember who Obama took out? Osama bin Laden. I mean, he gets what you need to [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  do against the enemy. That's what he's talking about. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=209.28s)]
*  Donald Trump gets it. It's peace through strength. That's what we need from the American leadership [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=211.8s)]
*  that we don't have right now. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=216.32s)]
*  Even the Democrats are saying Biden looks weak. First Lady Jill Biden defending the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=217.32s)]
*  after more troubling polling and it shows former President Trump leading in six of seven [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=221.61999999999998s)]
*  key battleground states. Biden and Trump are tied in the seventh state of Wisconsin. Here's [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=227.89999999999998s)]
*  the first lady's take. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=234.33999999999997s)]
*  He's not losing in all the battlegrounds. He's coming up and he's even or doing better. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=237.78s)]
*  So you know what? Once people start to focus in and they see their two choices, it's obvious [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=243.94s)]
*  that Joe will win this election. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=250.86s)]
*  It's not a part of you that's a little worried because it seemed to me off kilter a little [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=252.5s)]
*  bit. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=256.42s)]
*  No, I feel that Joe will be reelected. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=257.42s)]
*  Even Gail King was trying to throw her like a lifeline there. Come on. How are you missing [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=259.34000000000003s)]
*  all these numbers? A new opinion piece with the headline Joe Biden can't get out of the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=265.18s)]
*  hole. He's already dug for himself. David, I'll start with you. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=270.02000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, look, we've seen poll after poll that shows this is a razor thin race. We saw a [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=273.58000000000004s)]
*  in Pennsylvania showing Biden actually winning by double digits that just came out the other [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=279.78000000000003s)]
*  day. So the bottom line here is we can't read too much into the polls. Should we be concerned? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=283.98s)]
*  Absolutely. Is it Jill Biden's job to be concerned and worried? No, it's strategists and the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=289.1s)]
*  political team. But with that said, this is a snapshot. The biggest takeaway for me from [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=294.38s)]
*  all this polling is how engaged people are. It shows about 40% of the electorate right [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=299.42s)]
*  now is still not engaged. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=304.66s)]
*  That's fair. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=306.78000000000003s)]
*  That's why we see a lot of people not excited. And as we see the difference between Donald [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=307.78s)]
*  Trump and Joe Biden, as Trump continues to make these gaffes and talk about nonsense, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=312.58s)]
*  we're going to see people coming over to Joe Biden. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=317.9s)]
*  Listen, if you're going to defend Joe Biden, you can't talk about gas because nobody's [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=320.05999999999995s)]
*  more made more gas than Joe Biden has. The truth is what the first lady is doing. She's [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=323.34s)]
*  telling the ball face line. The latest polling Joe Biden is behind in every single key state, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=326.73999999999995s)]
*  except for one, where they're tied. And in many of these, Donald Trump is ahead outside [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=331.65999999999997s)]
*  the margin of error. The reason is this election is about security. It's about personal security. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=336.85999999999996s)]
*  It's about financial security. It's about national security. And most of all, it's about [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=341.61999999999995s)]
*  border security, none of which Joe Biden is in a position to speak on. It's unfortunate [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=345.65999999999997s)]
*  that the first lady is telling around the president of the United States, holding him [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=350.29999999999995s)]
*  by hand, shuffling him around from event to event. It's a sad state of affairs where we [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=354.52s)]
*  are. The American people know it. Over 70% of Americans say that Joe Biden is not mentally [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=358.61999999999995s)]
*  capable of leading this country. That's a fact you can't deny. And it puts every American [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=363.7s)]
*  at risk, not just Republicans, every Americans at risk with Joe Biden. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=368.38s)]
*  But I think the other point that we're not talking about here is that the issue with [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=371.97999999999996s)]
*  Florida, right? We just saw that there's going to be a referendum on the ballot. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=375.18s)]
*  Before you toggle to Florida and don't take up any of what he just said about your candidate. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=378.62s)]
*  Oh, there's plenty I can talk about there. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=383.21999999999997s)]
*  I think you're going to get a call from the Biden campaign soon saying, oh no, throw him [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=384.21999999999997s)]
*  a lifeline. David, it is always good to see you. T.W. you as well. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=388.34s)]
*  Good to see you, David. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=392.3s)]
*  And a handshake at the end. That's how Americans do it. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=393.3s)]
*  Absolutely. Yes, we debate and then we break bread together. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eys3HhAu5cU&t=396.1s)]
