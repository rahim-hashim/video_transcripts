# Columbia president facing bipartisan calls to resign over anti-Israel protests
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8)
*  Thank you. The president of Columbia University now facing bipartisan calls to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=0.0s)]
*  resign over her handling of anti-Semitic protests on campus. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=6.76s)]
*  Democrat Senator John Fetterman saying, quote, these protests are anti-Semitic, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=10.72s)]
*  unconscionable, and dangerous. Add some tiki torches, and it's Charlotteville for these [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=14.84s)]
*  Jewish students, to Columbia President Manu Shafik, do your job or resign so Columbia [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=19.52s)]
*  can find someone who will. Congressman Claudia Tenney is one of 10 New York Republican [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=25.36s)]
*  lawmakers that signed a letter calling for Shafik to step down, and she joins me now. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=30.4s)]
*  Congressman, great to be with you. Despite Shafik's words, let's face it, these protests [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=35.2s)]
*  are escalating. So why do you and many Democratic lawmakers as well feel that Shafik has [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=40.0s)]
*  reached the point of no return? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=45.8s)]
*  Well, obviously she's not able to contain these people, Todd. It's really tragic for these [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=48.96s)]
*  students. It's unsafe. And it violates Title VI of the Education Act, which requires a safe [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=53.68s)]
*  environment for learning and which could be contingent on them continuing to receive federal [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=60.64s)]
*  funds. Columbia, now you're in, I believe you're in Yale. I can't see the camera, but I [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  believe you're in Yale. We had this, this all started with Cornell University student, our [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=70.88s)]
*  Cornell University professor saying that it was exhilarating and exciting after the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=76.0s)]
*  horrific, brutal attacks on Hamas with the raping of children, burning children alive in [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=80.8s)]
*  families. And I immediately called for the expulsion of this professor. I wrote to the Cornell [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=85.67999999999999s)]
*  University president. And then you've seen what's transpired since then. You know, the obviously the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=92.32s)]
*  Education Committee under Virginia Foxx and the great work by Elise Stefanik. This letter was led [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=98.0s)]
*  by Elise Stefanik, who is the conference chair of the Republican Party. I'm glad to see there's some [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=103.6s)]
*  Democrats joining in. Unfortunately, the words of my colleague Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=108.24s)]
*  disturbing. These are dangerous protests and they put Jewish students at risk. And it's particularly [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  bad when you consider that we started the Passover season yesterday and this is a holy time for [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=118.08s)]
*  Jewish people. And I almost think it's deliberate. You know, you at this point, you know, if this [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=123.36s)]
*  president can't maintain the peace, she has to be eliminated or she has to be fired. And, you know, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=128.64s)]
*  these students have to be expelled. These faculty have to be fired. And we have to consider whether [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=135.44s)]
*  or not this board can take control of what's happening. And I give credit also to Mayor Adams [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=140.96s)]
*  for at least getting the police in there, the NYPD. But you're seeing a situation that is [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=148.4s)]
*  escalating because of money that is coming to these people. This is my firm belief. These are not, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=153.28s)]
*  you know, these are not grassroots. They're funded by outside groups, likely through 501C3s, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=159.52s)]
*  through Hamas. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=165.44s)]
*  COSTA There's definitely some funding here. And from the president of Colombia to the president of the United States, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=169.04s)]
*  here's Joe Biden's take on the protests that we've seen. Listen. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=174.16s)]
*  Do you condemn the anti-Semitic protests on college campuses? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=179.76s)]
*  I condemn the anti-Semitic protests. That's why I've set up a program to deal with that. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=183.76s)]
*  I also condemn those who don't understand what's going on with the Palestinians. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=188.72s)]
*  Should the Columbia University president resign? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=193.6s)]
*  I didn't know that. I'll let you know. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=196.32s)]
*  Should he resign? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=199.04s)]
*  Do you need to? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=201.35999999999999s)]
*  You have many people calling this Joe Biden's Charlottesville moment. I listen to an answer like that. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=203.44s)]
*  And to me, Congresswoman, it's clear why there's no sort of sense of right and wrong in this [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=209.12s)]
*  country when it comes to this issue, because the president of the United States is [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=215.44s)]
*  wishy-washy on it. Your thoughts? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=220.0s)]
*  Look, the president is not telling the truth. He is worried about getting re-elected. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=223.6s)]
*  This ceasefire anti-Jewish, anti-Semitic movement is largely because of one district in [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  Michigan, which could cost him the entire election. It's pure politics. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=236.24s)]
*  It's diabolical that this president can't stand up and support Israel, support our Jewish students, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=241.28s)]
*  and bring clarity to this issue. And as you said, Todd, correctly, this is a moral clarity moment [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=248.08s)]
*  for Joe Biden. He has failed. He has failed on this issue. He has failed to support [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  students under siege by a terrorist enemy. And this is just sad for our country, but it's [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=258.88s)]
*  also dangerous. As you can see, all of these students and their families, many are suffering [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=266.0s)]
*  through this terrible period, and we have to stand behind our Jewish friends and also [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=270.64s)]
*  against this anti-Semitism, something the Biden administration is not doing. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=274.72s)]
*  Let's face it. If you have the word president in your title, you should be unequivocal when it [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=281.2s)]
*  comes to this issue. Yet, when you hear the president of Columbia and the president of [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=287.04s)]
*  the United States, they are not. And that's the reason I think we're in the situation we're in. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=291.04s)]
*  Congresswoman Claudia Tenney, thank you for your moral clarity on this issue. We appreciate it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5Kizsl_wz8&t=295.6s)]
