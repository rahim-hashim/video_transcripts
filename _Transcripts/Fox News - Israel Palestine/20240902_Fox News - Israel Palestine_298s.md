# Biden, Harris scolded for ‘lack of leadership,' urged to make Hamas ‘pay a price’
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [September 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg)
*  Let's bring in Robert Greenway. He dealt with the Middle East as a member of the National Security Council. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=0.0s)]
*  He is now director of the Center for National Defense at the Heritage Foundation. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=5.0s)]
*  This is just so devastating for these families who have been holding out hope. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=11.0s)]
*  You know, months ago the Israeli-American who was found dead, Hirsch Goldberg-Polin, was actually in fact seen on video. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=16.0s)]
*  He lost his arm, which was blown off by these terrorists from the forearm down, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=24.0s)]
*  making some sort of propaganda plea for these terrorists, and now he has been found dead. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=29.0s)]
*  What does this say for the negotiations moving forward, and how urgent is it now more than ever to get the rest of the hostages that are being currently held out safely and alive? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=36.0s)]
*  Well, thanks for having me, Julie. We all mourn the loss of Hirsch Rachel Goldberg-Polin and his family members have our deepest sympathy and condolences, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=48.0s)]
*  but the execution of six hostages while ceasefire negotiations are underway tells you all you need to know about the terrorists that are responsible for the deadliest day in Israel's history [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=58.0s)]
*  and the deadliest terrorist attack against the United States since 9-11. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=68.0s)]
*  Any negotiation that allows this group to survive and repeat the horrific attacks of October the 7th is intolerable, and that's the dynamic tension. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=72.0s)]
*  The United States could play a more constructive role by applying pressure where it belongs, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=80.0s)]
*  against Hamas, the terrorist organization responsible for this act, and also against Iran, the sponsor for all of it and for regional escalation. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=85.0s)]
*  And this really does put a lot of pressure on this election and Kamala Harris and her ability to perhaps finally get in the middle and put her foot down, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=93.0s)]
*  as the United States has obviously been an ally of Israel but seems to not be able to make much leeway when it comes to negotiations. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=103.0s)]
*  Washington Post has this, if we could put it up on the screen. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=111.0s)]
*  The U.S. plans to present a take-it-or-leave-it Israel-Gaza ceasefire deal soon. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=114.0s)]
*  Axios saying Biden is considering presenting final Gaza deal proposal within days. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=120.0s)]
*  The pressure on the White House is unsurmountable. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=127.0s)]
*  And now that an American Israeli has been killed, what would you like to see come out of this White House? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=130.0s)]
*  Specifically, what would you like to hear from Kamala Harris, who is the sitting vice president right now, running to become the leader of the free world? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=137.0s)]
*  Well, first, I think righteous indignation and anger at the execution of an American and the execution of 32 Americans on October the 7th. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=144.0s)]
*  And pressure needs to be placed where it belongs, again, on the group responsible. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=155.0s)]
*  And so there has to be a price. Look, in foreign policy, as in other matters, you get what you pay for, you encourage, and you tolerate. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=159.0s)]
*  And if you encourage and if you reward the hostage taking that we've seen and the execution of hostage taking, you could be certain that more of it will occur. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=166.0s)]
*  And unless and until pressure is applied to Hamas and Iran, its sponsor, we'll continue to see these acts of depravity, as unfortunate as it sounds. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=174.0s)]
*  We need to stand with Israel, our, our, our erstwhile partner in the region and against terrorism more broadly. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=183.0s)]
*  And they need to pay a price for this act. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=189.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, Kamala Harris has stood up for Israel, but at the same time has also stood up for the pro-Palestinian protesters, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=191.0s)]
*  which are essentially championing terrorists who began this war in the beginning on October 7th, killing over a thousand Jews. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=198.0s)]
*  And so Senator Graham has words, if you will, for the vice president on her stance on foreign policy, now more important than ever. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=205.0s)]
*  She is running for president of the United States in the midst of this bloodbath in the Middle East. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=216.0s)]
*  Listen to his words and then I'll have you respond. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=221.0s)]
*  On foreign policy, she's been a wrecking ball. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=225.0s)]
*  On Israel, she sat there and listened to somebody call the Israeli government and people engaging in genocide and did nothing about it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=228.0s)]
*  She boycotted Bibi's speech to the Congress, sending the signal to Hamas and Iran that America really doesn't have Israel's back. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=236.0s)]
*  She was cheerleading the withdrawal from Afghanistan. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=244.0s)]
*  It's been the most incompetent administration I can remember on things that matter to the American people, your safety and your prosperity. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=248.0s)]
*  Your reaction? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=256.0s)]
*  I think Senator Graham is exactly right. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=259.0s)]
*  The contrast couldn't be more clear. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=261.0s)]
*  Four years ago, President Trump broke her diagram of courts and we saw regional peace as possible. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=263.0s)]
*  Four years later, we've seen nothing but regional conflict and escalation. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=268.0s)]
*  And it's costing Americans in terms of commodities. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=271.0s)]
*  Energy and gas prices have increased as a result. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=274.0s)]
*  Safety and security is definitely an issue here and there's been a lack of leadership in the White House and certainly a lack of leadership as we've heard from Vice President Harris. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=276.0s)]
*  Robert Greenway, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZVgfPAS1Rg&t=284.0s)]
