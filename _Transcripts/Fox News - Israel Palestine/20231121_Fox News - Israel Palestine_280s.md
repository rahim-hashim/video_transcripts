# Clay Travis: This is why some leftists don't view Jews as victims
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M)
*  Well, there's a wake up call for America's universities a push to scale back or even drop the controversial [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=0.0s)]
*  Dei programs and schools that's gaining steam [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=5.8s)]
*  Iowa's three public universities are now eyeing revisions and they are not alone [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=9.14s)]
*  Let's bring in Clay Travis out kick founder great to have you. This is David Barker [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=13.72s)]
*  He's a you of Iowa Board of Regents saying this there are several programs that are by policy open to all students [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=18.38s)]
*  But as they're marketed they could create a perception that they're not available to all students [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=24.900000000000002s)]
*  And so we're asking the universities re-examine that marketing and how these programs are presented to students to make sure [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=29.64s)]
*  That it's clear to everyone that these programs are available for all students [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=36.28s)]
*  And that was basically a way to say we want to scale back DEI. It's not working your thoughts [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=40.52s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's the the the protest that we've seen emerge in the wake of October 7th on many colleges university [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=47.72s)]
*  campuses all over the country [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  I think I've been incredibly clarifying Dana and Bill and I think the reason is many parents out there many [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=56.0s)]
*  Grandparents many donors many people who were educated 20 some odd years ago on college campuses [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=62.2s)]
*  Have been stunned to see that so many young people who were supposed to be the best educated generation in our history [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=67.64s)]
*  Are lining up behind Hamas are lining up between behind the idea that Israel in some way deserve the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=74.28s)]
*  Tax of October 7th and they're trying to figure out how do we create an environment where this kind of toxicity? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=81.24s)]
*  Could have been allowed to flourish and I think many are pointing back at DEI [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=87.32s)]
*  What I would say and I know you guys have seen this coming for some time is [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=92.08s)]
*  This is the triumph of identity politics over everything and a lot of us who were raised in the 80s 90s early [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=96.08s)]
*  2000s we bought into the multi melting pot the idea that while we may look different [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=103.08s)]
*  We were actually united by far more than we were by what divided us and sometime around [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=108.56s)]
*  2012 [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=116.44s)]
*  2014 this idea that your race was the most important thing about you and that your identity was [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  Inescapable and that you were very different than everyone else based on the color of your skin [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=125.92s)]
*  Took root and has continued to grow and it's led to what I call the basically identity politics [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=131.64000000000001s)]
*  pyramid of oppression where everything is seen through the lens of color and what happened is [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=137.76s)]
*  People said wait a minute the Jews are the victims here [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=144.44s)]
*  but many people on the far left in this country refused to believe that Jewish people could be victims because they see them as white and [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=147.79999999999998s)]
*  Many people out there are saying wait a minute just because Jews happen to be first of all [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=156.0s)]
*  They're all different sorts of colors, right? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=160.95999999999998s)]
*  But the idea that Palestine couldn't be responsible for this because they're seen as the colonized territory [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=162.72s)]
*  Many people out there have said we're clearly failing these kids quickly tray [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=169.52s)]
*  There is a piece in opinion piece today by a gentleman the name of John Saylor in the Wall Street Journal [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=173.88s)]
*  It's called inside Ohio State's DEI factory. So this is Columbus. Yeah, he says he got 800 pages of [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=180.04000000000002s)]
*  Information and he concludes it's a cautionary tale for all schools across the country. So maybe Iowa started the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  Started this trend and [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=195.6s)]
*  After you read something like this, you'll understand that they hired teachers based solely on this criteria [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=198.12s)]
*  Just got about 30 seconds clay [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=204.2s)]
*  Well what you're seeing is [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=207.36s)]
*  Unfortunately, the far left has now started to adopt a lot of the Jim Crow era [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=209.96s)]
*  Arguments that existed in the 1950s and this is happening in red states [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=216.12s)]
*  I would say Ron DeSantis in Florida did a good job pointing this out governor Kim Reynolds in [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=219.28s)]
*  Iowa now looking into it [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=224.12s)]
*  But I think everybody who was at a state-sponsored institution should be asking questions about this [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=225.56s)]
*  This DEI needs to be rooted out of universities [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=230.56s)]
*  We need to treat individuals like individuals as opposed to representatives of their identity politics coalitions [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=233.17999999999998s)]
*  Clay Travis great to see you. I bet you'll be watching some football this week. Oh, yeah, I'd probably be there [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=239.85999999999999s)]
*  Yes, Bill Hemmers, Ohio State Buckeyes against Michigan [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=244.7s)]
*  Ohio State versus Michigan on Fox and Dana. Here's a stat for you Detroit Lions kickoff Thanksgiving [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=248.73999999999998s)]
*  most wins for the Lions their 8-2 since [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=256.02s)]
*  1962 John F. Kennedy was still alive boom share it with your crew. They'll be blown away [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPBTi1C2-_M&t=260.46s)]
