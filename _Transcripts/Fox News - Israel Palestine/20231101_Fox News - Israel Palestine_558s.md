# Egypt opens Rafah border crossing to allow foreign nationals to leave Gaza
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w)

*  This is the first time we've seen traffic move in and out of the strip since the war began [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  You are watching Fox and Friends first on this Wednesday morning on Carly Shin and I'm Todd pyro [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=14.16s)]
*  The State Department says 400 Americans and their family members are in Gaza [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=18.72s)]
*  Jonathan Hunt live in Jerusalem with the very latest on all of it, Jonathan [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=23.52s)]
*  Todd and Carly good morning to you [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=28.52s)]
*  This is all the result of an agreement broken by the Qataris along with Egypt Israel the US and [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=30.96s)]
*  Hamas it will allow we are told all [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=39.2s)]
*  foreign nationals foreign passport holders to leave Gaza via that southern border crossing with [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=42.72s)]
*  Rafa as you look at a live picture now of that border crossing [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=49.8s)]
*  We understand that some of those foreign nationals have already gone through the crossing and have been processed [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=54.559999999999995s)]
*  We do not know at this point whether that includes Americans [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=61.919999999999995s)]
*  But we are told that Americans are obviously among those who will be allowed to leave Gaza today [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=66.08s)]
*  after three weeks stuck there in the most terrifying of [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=73.64s)]
*  Circumstances meantime US officials Todd and Carly are doing nothing to hide their concern over the potential for a [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=78.8s)]
*  regional [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=88.16s)]
*  Conflict here the impact that might have on US interests in the Middle East and the potential for a regional [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=89.2s)]
*  Conflict to inspire perhaps attacks even on [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=97.08000000000001s)]
*  US soil first to the conflict in the region and the concern over that the Pentagon has announced it is moving [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=101.36s)]
*  300 more US troops that brings to tow tow total [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=110.60000000000001s)]
*  1200 deployed since the terrorist attacks of [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=115.44s)]
*  October 7th including those on board the Eisenhower and USS Carney [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=119.4s)]
*  Carrier groups the concern is obviously Hezbollah in Lebanon getting involved Houthi groups in Yemen getting involved and [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=125.0s)]
*  ISIS inspired an Iran backed groups in Iraq and Syria and US troops [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=132.96s)]
*  Of course have already been targeted in the region many times [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=137.56s)]
*  Brigadier General Pat Ryder the Pentagon spokesman telling us yesterday afternoon that there have been at least [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=141.6s)]
*  27 attacks on bases housing US troops in Iraq and in Syria since October 7th [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=148.0s)]
*  Now no US troops have been killed in those attacks [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=154.56s)]
*  But more than 20 have suffered minor injuries and US officials as I say worried [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=157.36s)]
*  Not just about the possibility of attacks here in the region [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=162.96s)]
*  But also back at home his FBI director Christopher Ray [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=167.4s)]
*  Our most immediate concern is that violent extremists individuals or small groups will draw [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=173.20000000000002s)]
*  Inspiration from the events in the Middle East to carry out attacks against Americans foreign terrorist organizations traditional formal terrorist [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  organizations whether they be Al Qaeda or ISIS or Hezbollah [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=187.96s)]
*  Have all made statements that would indicate a greater risk of a potential attack here [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=192.28s)]
*  and [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=199.0s)]
*  director Ray said that the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=200.76000000000002s)]
*  potential threat level is reaching what he called quote [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  Historic levels Todd and Carly these are dangerous times [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=208.44s)]
*  We're living in one of the most concerning things you could hear from an FBI director was said by [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=211.89999999999998s)]
*  Christopher Ray yesterday [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=217.2s)]
*  Jonathan on the breaking news that you brought to us regarding the Rafa crossing [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=219.2s)]
*  We know that for weeks Hamas was reluctant reluctant to open their side of the gate [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=222.6s)]
*  Egypt didn't want to take these people in either so what changed [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=227.44s)]
*  Well, this has been obviously a deal that has been in the works for some time now the Qataris as you know have been playing [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=232.36s)]
*  A major role in all the mediation efforts on all levels regarding the hostages as well [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=240.12s)]
*  Although we are told this agreement is entirely separate from talks about the hostages [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=245.64000000000001s)]
*  But the sides the various groups including the US of course have got together [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=251.76000000000002s)]
*  They have hammered out this agreement, but it is only foreign nationals that are being allowed and some critically injured [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=256.24s)]
*  Palestinians and we saw the ambulances from the Egyptian side [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=264.36s)]
*  Crossing at Rafa that southern border crossing earlier today a short time ago those clearly on their way to pick up some of the dozens of [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=268.68s)]
*  Critically injured Palestinians who are being taken out today, but again. This is an entirely separate agreement car [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=277.32s)]
*  Carly from any talks about the release of hostages those talks still ongoing [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=284.56s)]
*  No progress that we know of to report at this point Carly and Todd and I would also say it is a start with regard to [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=291.20000000000005s)]
*  Getting the larger Gazan population out of the area people who want to leave going to other countries [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=298.32000000000005s)]
*  You know Egypt Jordan all these other countries in the region said we don't want these individuals [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=304.36s)]
*  Compare that to Poland at the start of the Ukraine war where Poland said bring us your refugees [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=309.4s)]
*  We will take care of you. It's incumbent upon those nations to take these people in they better wake up soon and do it [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=314.0s)]
*  Jonathan hunt. Thank you. Thank you Jonathan. Oh Mary is an expert on the underground tunnel system in Gaza [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=319.59999999999997s)]
*  He's also a captain in the IDF and he joins us now. Oh mayor a good morning to you [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=325.76s)]
*  You know, unlike a traditional war that is fought on the streets. This one is also going to be fought underground [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=330.71999999999997s)]
*  So what can you tell us about this network of tunnels how to destroy it Hamas militants hiding inside? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=335.88s)]
*  While also at the same time rescuing the hostages that could be there as well [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=343.88s)]
*  Thank you and good morning, thank you for the compliment I don't know if I'm an expert on tunnel warfare [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=351.0s)]
*  I am a former captain of the IDF and I fought in the Gaza Strip in two occasion 2009 and 2014 and [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=356.65999999999997s)]
*  I am completely aware of this threat of [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=366.08s)]
*  tunnels [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=369.91999999999996s)]
*  You need to understand that the tunnel threat is not just threatening you when you fight underground [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=371.59999999999997s)]
*  It's also it's also threatening you when you fight over ground [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=377.2s)]
*  Because [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=381.96s)]
*  You can be tackled from anywhere [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=383.35999999999996s)]
*  You can move [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=386.15999999999997s)]
*  certain building that you think that you cleared it, but all of a sudden you will see a tunnel hole and [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=388.08s)]
*  Forces will come out of there and tackle you so you always need to be prepared to be tackled 360 [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=394.2s)]
*  As you go along [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=400.79999999999995s)]
*  On the other end the tunnel threat is now more severe than it used to be in 2014 [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=402.91999999999996s)]
*  Because now we need to remember that as long we can see the tunnels [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=409.4s)]
*  In 2014, we just destroy them now. It's a whole new ballgame [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=415.0s)]
*  Because inside the tunnels there probably as we have seen from testimonies of people being taken there [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=420.03999999999996s)]
*  civilians Israeli civilians our own [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=427.28s)]
*  Men women children [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=430.91999999999996s)]
*  Elderlies that are being held there in order to protect the Hamas leaders and fighters [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=432.52s)]
*  So it's gonna be a whole new threat [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=438.12s)]
*  the idea for me to go inside and [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=441.03999999999996s)]
*  As we could see and we could hear and everyone thought of father could see the tunnels they are very wide tall [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=443.76s)]
*  booby-trapped in many occasions [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=451.56s)]
*  they have a lot of twists and turns you might not see where you're going and [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=454.8s)]
*  It's gonna be a very tough challenge for the IDF soldiers [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=461.44s)]
*  But I'm certain that they will be able to cope with it and overcome this challenge [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=466.08s)]
*  And this tunnel system is extensive. I mean take a look it stretches throughout Gaza [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=470.96000000000004s)]
*  Pop up on the screen. You can see some yellow lines showing where the tunnels themselves are located [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=475.72s)]
*  And look at that that is taking up what? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=481.24s)]
*  60% of Gaza based upon just what you're seeing there on your screen [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=484.44s)]
*  Where does the IDF get the Intel to know where to attack these tunnels? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=488.20000000000005s)]
*  And when is it from interrogation of Hamas prisoners? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=492.68s)]
*  Is it from Palestinians who you know want to keep the attacks from hitting their homes? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=496.0s)]
*  Which is oftentimes how you get into these tunnels. Where is the idea of getting its Intel from? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=500.48s)]
*  So I'm not an intelligence person [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=506.48s)]
*  I was an infantry soldier, but I can tell you that obviously probably the IDF gets [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=508.8s)]
*  Intel from people that interrogates but it also gets now as our soldiers are on the ground Intel from the soldiers [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=515.64s)]
*  You know our soldiers are inside the Gaza Strip right now [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=522.52s)]
*  they're progressing they're locating these tunnels and they market on all of the maps and [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=526.16s)]
*  Software's the IDF has and then it cross-reference with other object the idea has with [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=534.16s)]
*  air cameras [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=540.24s)]
*  And human intelligence as you said and it gives the idea of the ability to to provide a clear pictures on where these [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=541.96s)]
*  Tunnels and how you can eliminate them understood. Oh, we're leaving. Thank you so much for your insight [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=550.0799999999999s)]
*  It really was interesting. Appreciate it [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS4JWpODm-w&t=555.28s)]
