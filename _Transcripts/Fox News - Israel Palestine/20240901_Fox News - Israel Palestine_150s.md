# Israelis launch protests after Hamas murders six hostages in Gaza
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [September 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAoDJHqXlZs)
*  We begin with chief foreign correspondent Trey Yankst in Tel Aviv, Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAoDJHqXlZs&t=0.0s)]
*  And Trey, we understand there are quite a few demonstrations taking place behind you [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAoDJHqXlZs&t=5.78s)]
*  on this very sad day. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAoDJHqXlZs&t=10.8s)]
*  Tell us about them. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAoDJHqXlZs&t=12.6s)]
*  Yeah, Nita, good afternoon. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAoDJHqXlZs&t=14.0s)]
*  Thousands of people have gathered in the streets of Tel Aviv, Israel's second largest city [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAoDJHqXlZs&t=17.04s)]
*  to call for a hostage deal. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAoDJHqXlZs&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  Overnight, the military announced that six Israeli hostages were killed by Hamas inside [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAoDJHqXlZs&t=24.36s)]
*  the Gaza Strip as Israeli forces moved in. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAoDJHqXlZs&t=30.32s)]
*  I want to show you this spontaneous demonstration that has erupted in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAoDJHqXlZs&t=33.96s)]
*  They are calling for a deal from the Israeli government. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAoDJHqXlZs&t=39.0s)]
*  They have waited 331 days for their loved ones to come out of Gaza. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAoDJHqXlZs&t=42.32s)]
*  There's devastating news overnight that six of those hostages will be buried. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAoDJHqXlZs&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  Some funerals taking place today, at least one will happen tomorrow in Jerusalem. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAoDJHqXlZs&t=54.44s)]
*  As we gather more details about these individuals, you start to understand just how close they [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAoDJHqXlZs&t=59.67999999999999s)]
*  were to freedom. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAoDJHqXlZs&t=64.8s)]
*  A senior Israeli official talking to Fox News earlier today told me that three of the hostages [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAoDJHqXlZs&t=66.12s)]
*  were on the list of humanitarian captives that were going to be exchanged if a ceasefire [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAoDJHqXlZs&t=72.0s)]
*  took place. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAoDJHqXlZs&t=78.08s)]
*  And unfortunately, they were not able to make it out of Gaza alive. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAoDJHqXlZs&t=79.8s)]
*  And again, these demonstrators have gathered to call for an immediate ceasefire and hostage [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAoDJHqXlZs&t=84.56s)]
*  deal. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAoDJHqXlZs&t=90.12s)]
*  Among those who were killed by Hamas, according to the military, Hirsch Goldberg-Polen. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAoDJHqXlZs&t=91.12s)]
*  His story grabbed the attention of the world. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAoDJHqXlZs&t=98.24s)]
*  The 23-year-old was attending a music festival on Black Saturday when the October 7 massacre [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAoDJHqXlZs&t=99.96s)]
*  took place. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAoDJHqXlZs&t=105.92s)]
*  He was hit inside of a bomb shelter, Hamas ultimately throwing hand grenades into the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAoDJHqXlZs&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  shelter and he was wounded at that time. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAoDJHqXlZs&t=111.36s)]
*  He lost his arm, but he survived so many days in captivity. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAoDJHqXlZs&t=113.6s)]
*  There was a hostage video that showed Hirsch and his family, even this week, calling for [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAoDJHqXlZs&t=119.2s)]
*  his release at the Gaza border. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAoDJHqXlZs&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  This has been a devastating time for the Israeli people and again, they are in the streets [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAoDJHqXlZs&t=126.72s)]
*  of Tel Aviv tonight calling for a hostage deal with more than 100 Israelis dead and [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAoDJHqXlZs&t=130.8s)]
*  some alive still being held by Hamas inside Gaza. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAoDJHqXlZs&t=136.2s)]
*  Anita? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAoDJHqXlZs&t=139.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and it looks as though emotions are running very high there, understandably. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAoDJHqXlZs&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  Chief Foreign Correspondent Trey Yankst in Tel Aviv. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAoDJHqXlZs&t=145.44s)]
*  Trey, thank you so much. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAoDJHqXlZs&t=148.12s)]
