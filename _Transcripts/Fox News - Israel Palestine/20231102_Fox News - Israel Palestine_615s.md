# White House accused of hate 'hypocrisy'
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q)
*  We're tracking several major stories at this hour, starting with a new migrant caravan [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=0.0s)]
*  of over 5,000 that's headed directly for our southern border. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=6.4s)]
*  I wonder who's in that caravan. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=11.8s)]
*  This is where we're learning that over 600,000 people evaded law enforcement before crossing [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=14.08s)]
*  the border last year. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=18.86s)]
*  And get this, we have no knowledge of who they are or where they went or their affiliations. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=20.64s)]
*  Plus, FBI Director Christopher Wray says the threat of a terror attack on U.S. soil is [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=25.88s)]
*  at a whole other level. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=31.2s)]
*  He's warning that Hamas' actions will inspire the greatest U.S. terror threat since ISIS. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=33.68s)]
*  But first, we begin with the White House's refusal to classify violent anti-Semitic threats [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=39.96s)]
*  as domestic terrorism. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=47.46s)]
*  Hello, everyone. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=48.96s)]
*  This is Outnumbered. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=50.24s)]
*  I'm Kaylee McEnany, here with my co-host Emily Campagno and Harris Faulkner. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=51.24s)]
*  Also joining us, Restoring America editor for The Washington Examiner and senior fellow [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=55.48s)]
*  for the Independent Women's Forum, Kaylee McGee White, and former Biden campaign surrogate [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=59.559999999999995s)]
*  Kevin Walling. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=64.8s)]
*  Now, the White House is being accused of hypocrisy when it comes to hatred. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=65.8s)]
*  You should be able to call hate, hate. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  Anti-Semitism, anti-Semitism. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=74.12s)]
*  Remember, the Biden administration directed the FBI to investigate concerned parents? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=75.12s)]
*  After they protested about pornography at the school board meetings in front of their [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=82.32s)]
*  young children. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=86.96s)]
*  And they had no problem targeting Catholics either. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=87.96s)]
*  Remember that FBI memo from last year warning that radical, traditional Catholics, never [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=90.96s)]
*  heard of those, could be, quote, violent extremists. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=96.28s)]
*  And remember pro-life Catholic Mark Halk, just a father, an innocent father? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=101.32s)]
*  The FBI treated him like a domestic terrorist. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  They arrested him at gunpoint, FBI agents in his front yard in front of his screaming [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=109.74s)]
*  children for defending his son against a Planned Parenthood volunteer. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=115.5s)]
*  Thankfully, we still have juries in this country and he was found innocent. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=120.78s)]
*  But when it comes to those making violent threats against Jews during a worldwide surge [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=125.38s)]
*  in anti-Semitism, the White House won't call them domestic terrorists. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=129.57999999999998s)]
*  The people in this country making violent anti-Semitic threats, are they domestic terrorists? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=136.02s)]
*  I don't know that we're classifying people as domestic terrorists for that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=142.70000000000002s)]
*  I mean, that's really a question better left to law enforcement. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=149.3s)]
*  I'm not aware that there's been such a characterization of that. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=152.62s)]
*  So not domestic terrorists. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=157.70000000000002s)]
*  Well, let's try extremists. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=159.46s)]
*  Does President Biden think the anti-Israel protesters in this country are extremists? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=162.7s)]
*  What I can say is what we've been very clear about this. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=168.78s)]
*  When it comes to anti-Semitism, there is no place. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=172.22s)]
*  We have to make sure that we speak against it very loud and be very clear about that. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=175.22s)]
*  What about these protesters who are making Jewish students feel unsafe on college campuses? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=182.17999999999998s)]
*  Are they extremists? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=187.54s)]
*  I've been very, very clear. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=188.54s)]
*  We are calling out any form of hate, any form of hate. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=190.26s)]
*  It is not acceptable. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=195.89999999999998s)]
*  It should not be acceptable here. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=197.82s)]
*  And we are going to continue to call that out. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=199.98s)]
*  You know, I just don't get it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=202.42s)]
*  Kevin, the DOJ has arrested a student who published a threat to stab and slit the throat [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=204.85999999999999s)]
*  of any Jewish males he sees on campus and to rape and throw off a clip any Jewish females [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=211.42s)]
*  and to behead any Jewish babies. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=217.1s)]
*  That seems like an extremist to me. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=219.62s)]
*  And a domestic terrorist. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=220.86s)]
*  It's 100% an extremist and 100% a domestic terrorist. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=221.86s)]
*  He should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law of the student at Cornell University. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=224.74s)]
*  You know, Harris, on the Faulkner Focus, you played some of Director Wray's testimony [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=229.38000000000002s)]
*  yesterday before Congress. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=234.3s)]
*  You know, Jews represent just about 2.5% of Americans in this country but are faced with [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=235.94s)]
*  60% of the violent extremism, the threats. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=242.5s)]
*  But why won't the White House say it? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=245.70000000000002s)]
*  Well, they should. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=247.42000000000002s)]
*  They should. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=248.42000000000002s)]
*  I think it's very clear when he was in Israel on that trip and since then, before multiple [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=249.45999999999998s)]
*  audiences condemning this anti-Semitism, we need to call it out as extremism. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=253.89999999999998s)]
*  The fact that threats are up 400% against Jewish Americans is intolerable. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=257.86s)]
*  It's disgusting. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=262.86s)]
*  It's not who we are as Americans. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=263.86s)]
*  And we need to call it what it is. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=265.5s)]
*  You know, Harris, there's a gut reaction with this DOJ. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=266.5s)]
*  Go after the parent. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=270.14s)]
*  Go after the Catholic. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=271.14s)]
*  Go after the pro-lifer. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=272.14s)]
*  Where is the gut reaction from the White House to call the anti-Semitic extremism what it [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=273.9s)]
*  is? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=278.9s)]
*  Extremism. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=279.9s)]
*  Well, right now they're caught between the 2.5% of Jewish Americans and about 2% Muslim [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=280.9s)]
*  voters. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=285.62s)]
*  That's where they're caught. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=286.62s)]
*  And I don't know why they feel like they can't do both, why they can't say to both sides, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=287.9s)]
*  look, you guys are saying that you're with the terrorists. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=292.17999999999995s)]
*  If you want to change your message, you can change your message. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=294.09999999999997s)]
*  But in the meantime, America always stands with Israel. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=296.21999999999997s)]
*  And I go back to you on this. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=299.62s)]
*  And with Jewish Americans too. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=300.62s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=301.62s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=302.62s)]
*  So I come back to you on this because I'm really curious. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=303.62s)]
*  Are you as frustrated as the rest of us when we watch from the White House podium preach [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=306.06s)]
*  to daily about Islamophobia is equal to what's happening in Israel right now? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=310.14s)]
*  They're two separate things. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=315.58s)]
*  You can treat them equally or differently, but they are not interchangeable. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=317.08s)]
*  Are you frustrated at all? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=321.14s)]
*  I know when I watch, I don't understand why she can't simply answer the question that [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=322.54s)]
*  we are talking about right now. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=327.94s)]
*  And that is this is domestic terrorism. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=330.02s)]
*  And if they come here and attack us on the soil, that's what it's going to be. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=333.0s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=337.08s)]
*  Listen, we need to call a spade a spade in terms of what this is. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=338.08s)]
*  The president has been very clear. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=340.46s)]
*  I think what we need to see is more moral clarity coming out of the White House in terms of [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=341.68s)]
*  their sports people on this issue. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=346.32s)]
*  I think you're going to see it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=347.8s)]
*  And you saw the press secretary very well come back. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=349.0s)]
*  She clarified her remarks earlier because they fell short. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=353.4s)]
*  And we sometimes get this wrong. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=356.32s)]
*  That should have been a visceral reaction. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=358.16s)]
*  We had Congress in Moscow. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=360.08s)]
*  It's on. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=361.08s)]
*  To underscore that, you shouldn't have to turn to the tab in your binder. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=362.15999999999997s)]
*  You should be able to do that on command as a gut reaction. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=364.76s)]
*  And she wasn't. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=368.03999999999996s)]
*  Here's the State Department spokesperson, though, asked about an anti-Semitic employee [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=369.03999999999996s)]
*  being paid for with your taxpayer dollars. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=373.12s)]
*  One more question, if you don't mind. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=376.4s)]
*  Senator Chuck Grassley has written to the secretary a few times about Fritz Bergen, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=378.68s)]
*  a State Department employee, accusing him of maintaining a publicly available blog that [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=382.96s)]
*  includes a lot of anti-Semitic content. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=388.79999999999995s)]
*  He calls the Jewish people the devil's children. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=391.04s)]
*  So your state has confirmed to us that he is still an employee. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=395.24s)]
*  Has he faced any disciplinary action? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=399.56s)]
*  So because of privacy restrictions that apply to every federal employee, I'm unable to talk [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=402.24s)]
*  about any individual employee's employment file and employment status here at the State [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=407.08000000000004s)]
*  Department. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=415.8s)]
*  I will say, of course, as a general rule, we oppose anti-Semitism in any form. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=416.8s)]
*  Insufficient Matt Miller. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=422.36s)]
*  Look at this, Emily. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=424.68s)]
*  He can't tell us what's happening with their taxpayer dollars. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=425.68s)]
*  But this employee has been issuing anti-Semitic remarks for a long time. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=428.52000000000004s)]
*  Take a look at this letter. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=433.0s)]
*  This is from Charles Grassley, Senator Grassley. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=434.0s)]
*  Take a look at the date. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=436.44s)]
*  July 14th. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=437.44s)]
*  It's November 1st, July 14th. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=438.44s)]
*  Grassley said, based on reports, the State Department still employs Fritz Bergen as a [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=441.32s)]
*  foreign service officer. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=445.5s)]
*  And at one time he was reportedly assigned to a unit that handles special immigrant visas [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=447.26s)]
*  for Afghans. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=451.2s)]
*  He was demanding answers back in the summer. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=452.2s)]
*  And unfortunately, it seems that the answers are still opaque. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=456.36s)]
*  When the solution is so clear, first of all, I understand this employee is on administrative [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=459.74s)]
*  leave, which we are still paying for, which means they're enjoying watching TV at home. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=463.54s)]
*  They are enjoying the likely fruits of their nefarious labor. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=468.16s)]
*  I'd like to point out, in addition to all of those examples you laid out, Kaylee, how [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=471.14s)]
*  our president has articulated where his priorities are. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=475.18s)]
*  So do we recall back in January of 2021 when he was first sworn in at the swearing-in ceremony [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=478.56s)]
*  for his employees? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=484.2s)]
*  He told everyone, he told the world, I will fire you on the spot, he said to his employees [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=485.66s)]
*  if they showed any form of, quote, disrespect. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=490.78000000000003s)]
*  He said apparently he has a, quote, zero tolerance for firearms dealers. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=494.6s)]
*  That was in June of 2021, if any of them go what he called rogue. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=499.44s)]
*  In March, he called Governor DeSantis' legislation that was protecting parental rights, quote, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=504.3s)]
*  close to sinful. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=509.74s)]
*  And just 11 hours ago, we learned from the White House that they are creating a national [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=511.38s)]
*  strategy to combat, wait for it, Islamophobia. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=515.26s)]
*  That is where their priorities are. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=520.06s)]
*  That is where their attention is. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=521.7s)]
*  And if he can be so clear, so quick to fire someone on the spot for disrespect, and yet [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=523.1s)]
*  blatant, atrocious, unacceptable, hateful anti-Semitism, so clear here, there's just [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=528.74s)]
*  silence, there's an unwillingness to condemn, it is shameful. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=534.98s)]
*  I expect nothing less from this administration. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=538.34s)]
*  It is shameful. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=540.42s)]
*  And I believe the employee that's on administrative leave is another employee at DHS. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=541.42s)]
*  There are two. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=545.98s)]
*  There are two. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=546.98s)]
*  At least two. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=547.98s)]
*  And this one seemed to celebrate the October 7th attack with a picture of a paraglider. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=548.98s)]
*  There are two taxpayer dollars. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=553.38s)]
*  Yeah, and I want to touch on something that Kevin said where he was asking why the administration [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=554.9s)]
*  is unable to provide moral clarity. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=559.66s)]
*  And the fact is they're not able to provide moral clarity because they've spent the past [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=562.34s)]
*  two years deliberately blurring the lines and foaming out the mouth over things that [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=565.9s)]
*  do not matter. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=570.1s)]
*  If you have someone like Ilhan Omar calling Jim Jordan a terrorist, if you have the FBI [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=571.54s)]
*  smearing faithful Catholics as potential extremists, if you have the FBI smearing concerned parents [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=576.94s)]
*  as potential domestic terrorists, you have lost the ability to define what is right and [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=583.26s)]
*  what is wrong. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=588.38s)]
*  And that's why we're not getting any moral clarity from the White House. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=589.4200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and if moral clarity is really coming from the top, get the Biden spokespeople in [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=591.94s)]
*  the room from all departments, have a talk with them, get better answers. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjn4zU0Oj3Q&t=596.02s)]
