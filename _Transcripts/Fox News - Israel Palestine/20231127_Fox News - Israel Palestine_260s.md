# Israeli official explains 'painful' process of working with Hamas to free hostages
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs)
*  We want to bring in Mark Regev. He's a senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=0.0s)]
*  Hello, sir. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=4.48s)]
*  It's really great to have you with us as sun sets in Israel. Can you tell us what it is like there on the ground? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=4.98s)]
*  What could we expect as dark falls and the ceasefire really enters its final day? Will it be extended? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=10.88s)]
*  So, first of all, we've got to say that, see, that today goes well. Hamas has to release the final group of hostages. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=18.88s)]
*  As you know, the agreement brokered with the help of the United States said over a four day period, 50 Israeli hostages would release, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=25.6s)]
*  but be released by Hamas, women and children. Tonight, we're supposed to see the fourth and final group. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=34.96s)]
*  And we want to see that go well. I think before we can talk too much about what happens after that, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  because if Hamas can't keep its original commitments, then obviously it's difficult to talk about further commitments or further understandings. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=46.44s)]
*  Having said that, we were all so happy to see the people return last night, especially the youngest hostage returned last night, a young Abigail Idan, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=55.84s)]
*  four years old. As you know, she was kidnapped. She was three years old. She turned four in Hamas captivity. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=64.84s)]
*  I'm sure that wasn't a very great birthday for her, but at least she's home now. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=71.52s)]
*  She has two older siblings that hid in the cupboard and were therefore saved, a nine year old and a six year old. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=76.48s)]
*  And unfortunately, though, as you reported on Fox, both her parents were murdered by the Hamas. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=83.36s)]
*  But I can assure you that her community and this country will unite around Abigail, excuse me, and her siblings and will do everything we can together with the family [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=88.36s)]
*  to get these three kids back on the path and to have them have a normal life as possible given the circumstances. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=99.12s)]
*  She's going to need a lot of help. And I know you're aware of that. You said the number 50. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=106.28s)]
*  I'm just trying to keep this all straight for us and for our audience. How far away are we from that number? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=110.2s)]
*  How many would you expect in this upcoming fourth exchange if it happens your way? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=117.16s)]
*  So according to my math, they've released so far Hamas has released three groups of 13. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=122.92s)]
*  And though my mother would tell you math was never my strong point when I was in high school, that's 39, which means there's another 11 that need to be released tonight. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=129.16s)]
*  And that'll be a total of 50. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=138.56s)]
*  OK, just to be clear, are you not, I'm sorry, are you not counting those who have citizenship in Thailand? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=140.24s)]
*  No, though that was a separate deal. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=150.24s)]
*  The Thai government went through to the Iranians and the Iranians delivered Hamas for them. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=152.44s)]
*  As you know, Iran has very strong influence over Hamas. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=159.08s)]
*  They supply 93 percent of its military budget. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=162.52s)]
*  They give them diplomatic cover. They give them, as I said, financial support. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=165.76s)]
*  They give them military support. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  So Iran is very, you know, cozy with Hamas. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=171.68s)]
*  Hamas is an Iranian proxy in many ways. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=174.96s)]
*  And therefore, when the Iranians ask Hamas to deliver the ties, that's been done. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=177.88s)]
*  That's not part of our numbers. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=182.2s)]
*  Our numbers are for the Israelis kidnapped on October 7th. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  They had to release 50. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=190.36s)]
*  Eleven tonight will take it up to 50. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=192.2s)]
*  And if today goes well, though I have to tell you, every time you work with Hamas, it's always difficult. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=194.6s)]
*  It's like having your teeth pulled. It's painful. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=202.12s)]
*  In the end, you hope we get a positive result. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=204.88s)]
*  So we will see tonight if we get the last 11. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=206.84s)]
*  And if that's true, we can start having conversations. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=210.0s)]
*  Can this humanitarian pause be extended? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=213.2s)]
*  My prime minister said last night publicly that we are willing for the extension on the proviso. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=215.92s)]
*  And this we won't compromise on. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=221.88s)]
*  OK, sir, just one last question. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=223.4s)]
*  I got to keep it short because we're going to a family member here next. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=225.12s)]
*  How many hostages do you believe Hamas still holds today or Hamas or Islamic Jihad combined? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=229.08s)]
*  What's the number? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=236.60000000000002s)]
*  So we're talking about over 150. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=238.4s)]
*  OK, sir, thank you so much for your time. Appreciate it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=241.8s)]
*  Yes, very much. Thank you. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=245.88000000000002s)]
*  Mark, thank you. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=247.72000000000003s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCdwuMjyFfs&t=249.60000000000002s)]
