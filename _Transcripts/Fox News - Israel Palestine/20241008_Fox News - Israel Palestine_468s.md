# We’re out of our minds with concern: Father of American hostage in Gaza
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE)
*  All right, protests across the country today, particularly in the New York area, but out [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=0.0s)]
*  in Israel, the protests concern getting the hostages released. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=6.92s)]
*  There are about 100 of them. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=10.94s)]
*  They include four American hostages. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  One of them is Segei Dekulshin, an Israeli American who was taken hostage by Hamas on [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=14.84s)]
*  that fateful day. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=23.32s)]
*  His father, Jonathan, kind enough to join us. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=24.6s)]
*  Jonathan, very good to have you. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=27.44s)]
*  This day must hit you particularly hard, and I apologize for that. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=30.36s)]
*  But you have a message, right? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=34.28s)]
*  I mean, you don't want us to forget your son and those other hostages. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  Well, that's absolutely true correction. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  There are seven U.S. hostages remaining. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=45.96s)]
*  Four of them, we hope, we believe are still alive. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=49.32s)]
*  Three of them we know have already been murdered. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  As far as this day is concerned, look, on October 7th, for most Israelis, certainly [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=56.48s)]
*  anyone that has any connection to a victim, an Israeli victim of that day, be they murdered [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=62.279999999999994s)]
*  or taken captive, time stopped. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=71.08s)]
*  And so today is just sort of another day of living hell, most importantly for the hostages [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=73.88s)]
*  but also for all of their families and most Israelis who believe that they must, as a [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=80.56s)]
*  national priority, come home. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=87.32000000000001s)]
*  I'm sure you don't relish talking about this, but can you tell us about how Jonathan was [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=89.64s)]
*  captured or how your son was captured and what went down that day? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=95.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Segei was taken hostage from our home, about a mile from the border, for the viewers [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  who aren't familiar. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=110.0s)]
*  Akibbutz is a cooperative farm, small communities, ours numbered about 400 people altogether. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=111.0s)]
*  Civilian, entirely civilian. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=118.08s)]
*  And that morning of October 7th, 200 Nukhba terrorists, terrorist commandos, invaded Akibbutz [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=121.04s)]
*  simultaneously, armed heavily, very well trained, and they were followed immediately by several [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=130.4s)]
*  hundred looters. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=136.6s)]
*  All of them civilians, some armed, some not. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=138.51999999999998s)]
*  And so in combination between the terrorists and the looters, 51 of our community were [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  murdered that day, another 79 taken hostage, among them my son, and our community completely [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=147.04s)]
*  destroyed. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=155.56s)]
*  And unlike other places along the border, other communities, the Israeli army never [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=156.79999999999998s)]
*  came to Akibbutz. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=161.67999999999998s)]
*  It's something that still needs to be investigated in a serious way. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=163.4s)]
*  So the terrorists and the looters were allowed to rampage through Akibbutz for about seven [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=168.6s)]
*  and a half hours. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=174.36s)]
*  And the only defense that we had was our small civilian first responder team, all of whom [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=176.04000000000002s)]
*  were either killed that morning or taken hostage. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=183.36s)]
*  Sagi, who is a father of three little girls, was taken in around 9.30 in the morning that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=189.0s)]
*  day, trying to defend his family and the community as a whole. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=195.56s)]
*  You know, Jonathan, the vice president, Kamala Harris, briefly had an opportunity to answer [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  a question concerning these ongoing ceasefire negotiations, saying the administration do [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=206.44s)]
*  everything it can to broker a deal. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=211.48s)]
*  But the backdrop for this, as you know better than anyone, is this expanded war with Iran. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=213.51999999999998s)]
*  Israel now getting ready to respond to that missile attack last week. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=218.48s)]
*  Are you worried? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=224.51999999999998s)]
*  Well, we're extremely worried. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=225.51999999999998s)]
*  But we've been worried well before, hostage families have been worried well before this [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  more recent escalation with Iran. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=233.76s)]
*  The vast majority of Israelis, and you showed briefly beforehand those protesting in the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=236.76s)]
*  streets, it's a small handful of Israelis. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=241.32s)]
*  These are hundreds of thousands, millions actually in the aggregate, who have been protesting [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=244.16s)]
*  since November against our own government, who has not prioritized the safety of the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=248.4s)]
*  hostages and getting them back within its supposed war aims and the war against Hamas. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  And so this is another layer of worry, of course, and concern for the lives of the hostages, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=263.64s)]
*  because new cycles are what they are. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=270.2s)]
*  Any distraction from the lives of these hostages, be it from an expanding conflict or anything [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=274.08000000000004s)]
*  else, puts them at greater risk. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=281.04s)]
*  The fact of the matter is that they continue to die in captivity, and Israel for the last [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=283.08000000000004s)]
*  two months has only been able to recover bodies of hostages that have either been executed [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=288.7s)]
*  by Hamas in recent weeks and months or who've perished from tragic friendly fire. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=297.24s)]
*  So all of this is incredibly concerning, but I think most Israelis would agree with me. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=303.8s)]
*  The most concerning thing is our government doesn't really seem to care that much about [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=309.03999999999996s)]
*  the fate of the hostages, lip service aside. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=312.71999999999997s)]
*  Jonathan, do you have evidence or have there been reports that your son is indeed alive [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=315.76s)]
*  with these three other Americans and 90-some-odd others who could also be held captive? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=322.78s)]
*  Well, the situation is this. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=327.78s)]
*  Hamas, from October 7th, has not allowed any Red Cross, Red Crescent visits or any other [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=333.18s)]
*  international organization to see the hostages. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=340.06s)]
*  The little that we know about Sagih and most of the other hostages came in late November, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=343.65999999999997s)]
*  early December. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=349.98s)]
*  There was an initial hostage agreement with Hamas, between Israel and Hamas, brokered [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=350.98s)]
*  by the United States, that returned of the 250-odd hostages that were taken by Hamas, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=357.70000000000005s)]
*  100-plus came home. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=366.70000000000005s)]
*  Of those 140 were from my kibbutz, from my home, women and children who were able to [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=368.82s)]
*  tell us that they had seen, very briefly had seen Sagih and many other hostages before [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=374.58000000000004s)]
*  they were released. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=380.68s)]
*  They encountered them in the tunnels under Gaza. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=381.68s)]
*  At that time, they were able to tell us that Sagih was alive but wounded. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=385.24s)]
*  That's an eternity ago. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=390.56s)]
*  And most tragically, many of the men that they encountered at that time have been declared [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=392.28000000000003s)]
*  dead. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=399.56s)]
*  Some of their bodies returned to Israel by the IDF, which means that the hostages are [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=400.56s)]
*  by execution or neglect by Hamas, any kind of torture and by friendly fire. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=407.0s)]
*  So we are sort of out of our minds with concern about this and asking the international community [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=413.84s)]
*  to, in any way possible, apply pressure on Hamas for it to get to yes in any kind of [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=422.8s)]
*  negotiated agreement that will return hostages. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=433.2s)]
*  So of course, create a ceasefire to stop the madness in Gaza. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=435.56s)]
*  Jonathan, I cannot paint enough for you, people listening to your story and your son's story, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=439.2s)]
*  our thoughts and prayers. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=446.28000000000003s)]
*  I know you get tired of hearing that from a lot of people who, meanwhile, don't know [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=447.28000000000003s)]
*  what to say, but they are with you. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=450.12s)]
*  And Sagih, let's just see what happens. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=453.04s)]
*  Thank you, Jonathan. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL666by3eKE&t=455.48s)]
