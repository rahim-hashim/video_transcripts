# We should not recognize the ICC in anyway: GOP lawmaker
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [May 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4)
*  Let's bring in Republican Congressman Brian Mast of Florida. He's a member of the House [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=0.0s)]
*  Foreign Affairs Committee and a retired Army Staff Sergeant. He's also volunteered and served [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=3.44s)]
*  alongside Israel's Defense Forces. Congressman, thank you for your service, and happy Memorial [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=8.48s)]
*  Day to you. Thank you. I want to get your first response to some of the reports that we've got [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=13.68s)]
*  coming out of Israel tonight. There was the rocket attack, followed by the attack there. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=20.96s)]
*  Israel is now investigating what it strikes as it killed a couple of Hamas leaders. Also, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=26.0s)]
*  reports of a few dozen civilians who have died. What's your reaction to that? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=30.96s)]
*  I think you look at two things. One, the fact that there are still rocket attacks threatening [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=37.44s)]
*  Tel Aviv, Israel. It shows you that the job is not done. The mission is not complete yet. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=41.68s)]
*  They still have a mechanism to receive arms, whether through tunnels going into Egypt or [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=46.08s)]
*  other places. There is still a supply chain that is feeding Hamas. There are still Hamas fighters. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=50.56s)]
*  They are out there engaging in attacking Israel, and they still want to see no Israel exist. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=55.84s)]
*  The other side of this that unfortunately we do not see outrage for is that there will continue [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=60.88s)]
*  to be civilian casualties if the world does not become up in arms about the fact that Hamas [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=66.56s)]
*  purposefully embeds themselves with civilians, purposefully places civilians in front of [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=74.08000000000001s)]
*  themselves, aid workers in front of themselves, purposefully tries to use UNRWA as a location, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=79.44s)]
*  their locations to build tunnels for Hamas that go into Egypt and other places. As long as that's [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=85.28s)]
*  allowed to continue, then we will see what unfortunately the world does not want to see, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=90.72s)]
*  which is a civilian killed here or a civilian killed there because of what Hamas does. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=96.08s)]
*  The international pressure we have seen is for Israel to completely stop its offensive in Ra'afah. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=101.2s)]
*  Do you think that this continuing international pressure has affected Israel at all? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=106.4s)]
*  There is no question that Israel sees the international pressure, but what is most stark [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=111.76s)]
*  to me is the fact that America is allowing itself, President Biden is allowing America to be pulled [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=118.88000000000001s)]
*  into this and continually forgetting the fact that we have Americans currently being held [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=124.08000000000001s)]
*  by these terrorists. We have Americans that were killed on October 7 by these terrorists, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=130.56s)]
*  and there has never been an expectation that there will be Americans sent to come get [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=137.36s)]
*  those Americans that are being held. That's what's going on with this administration. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=142.0s)]
*  No guarantee that America is there for Americans. That's not what this country is about, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=146.88s)]
*  especially on Memorial Day. So the International Criminal Court has advanced arrest wardens for [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=151.76s)]
*  the Prime Minister of Israel, the head of the defense there. The House is going to consider [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=157.12s)]
*  sanctions against the ICC. Do you think those will pass the House? Do you think they will pass [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=163.44s)]
*  Congress? And do you think that the administration should go ahead and sanction the ICC? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=168.0s)]
*  So myself, Representative Chip Roy, Senator Tom Cotton, we have been at the forefront of [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=174.16s)]
*  authoring those sanctions. I do believe that they will go through the House. The holdup on them [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=180.0s)]
*  right now, or let's say the impasse on them right now, is whether there should be a presidential [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=184.48s)]
*  waiver for some of these people from the ICC to be allowed in for, say, the U.N. General Assembly, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=189.6s)]
*  if the president determines that that's what he wants to do. And many of us say there should be [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  no waiver whatsoever. That's really the only impasse going on in this. But no, we should not [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=199.12s)]
*  recognize the ICC in any way whatsoever. They were an entity that was meant to deal with countries [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=203.6s)]
*  that don't have court systems, don't have justice systems, and here they are working towards trying [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  to arrest Prime Minister Netanyahu for defending his country against terrorists that purposely put [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=214.4s)]
*  civilians in front of themselves. And the ICC has caught bipartisan criticism here in the U.S. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=223.84s)]
*  And, Congressman, I want to move on to what your message is for Americans on this Memorial Day. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=228.72s)]
*  This is a day, as many have said, it's specifically for remembering those that fought [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=236.8s)]
*  and gave their lives. I know that you guys aired what I believe to be the two most important hymns [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=240.96s)]
*  to the United States of America, which was first the Star Spangled Banner, our national anthem, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=246.4s)]
*  which should give us all just pride, send our chin up and our chest out for this country, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=251.84s)]
*  and then you aired immediately following the taps. And for those of us that have lost friends in [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=256.72s)]
*  service, you hear that slow, solemn hum of taps. It brings us to tears. We've seen it with flags [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=263.6s)]
*  draped over the coffins of our friends. That's what this day is about. It's about remembering [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=270.48s)]
*  that sacrifice, remembering that some of us get to continue living and make sure that we live [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=275.44s)]
*  worthy of that sacrifice. Florida Congressman Brian Mast, also a veteran. Thank you very much, sir. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=280.08000000000004s)]
*  Much appreciated. Thank you. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afTyPT0iuw4&t=286.16s)]
