# Biden setting stage to abandon Israel, expert warns
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE)
*  The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is officially over. Black smoke now rising above [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=0.0s)]
*  the Gaza Strip. You see it there as the IDF resumes its airstrikes on Hamas targets in [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=6.78s)]
*  the area. But it appears the Biden administration is looking to back away from its steadfast [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  support for Israel. Surprise, surprise. The Washington Post reporting, quote, what began [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=18.54s)]
*  as a bear hug strategy of intense backing by President Biden has become one in which [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=23.580000000000002s)]
*  U.S. officials facing growing blowback at home and internationally have distanced themselves [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=29.28s)]
*  from scorched earth Israeli tactics. And don't forget the political gloss here. They're under [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=34.64s)]
*  intense political pressure. Meanwhile, the foundation for Defense of Democracy CEO Mark [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=39.56s)]
*  Dubowicz writing the Biden administration is setting the stage to abandon Israel. What [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=44.96s)]
*  started off as we are totally with you and destroying Hamas, which is as bad as ISIS, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=49.88s)]
*  is deteriorating into you don't have our support unless you can dismantle Hamas very [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=54.72s)]
*  quickly with very limited civilian casualties. That is impossible. Pete, I want to pull up [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=60.24s)]
*  for you. This is from the Times of Israel. It is allegedly what Tony Blinken said in [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=66.72s)]
*  a private meeting with Israel. Here it goes. Defense Minister Yoav Galant says the entire [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=71.72s)]
*  Israeli society is united behind the goal of dismantling Hamas, even if it takes months, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=77.24s)]
*  to which Blinken allegedly replied, I don't think you have the credit for that. That would [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=83.14s)]
*  be as if nearly 3000 Americans died on 9 11. We go into Afghanistan and our ally Israel [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=89.18s)]
*  or the United Kingdom says you don't have the credit for that while and we're going [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=95.26s)]
*  to put this up while you speak. They're finding tunnels under children's beds. They're going [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=98.98s)]
*  into hospitals and finding weapons. That is what Israel is doing. It's absolutely absurd. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=103.42s)]
*  And this is this is how Hamas fights. This is who Hamas is. We've seen it on display [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=108.14s)]
*  since October 7th and well before that you get a generation of vets here in America who [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=111.66000000000001s)]
*  spent two decades overseas knowing how Islamists think and the depth of their depravity and [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=115.46000000000001s)]
*  their commitment to their cause to kill crusaders, to kill Jews, to kill Westerners. That's their [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=121.34s)]
*  view. And Benjamin Netanyahu has a very clear eyed view about that too. That's why his statement [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=126.30000000000001s)]
*  of Hamas will be eradicated. I believe him. That's exactly what Israel should do down [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=131.42000000000002s)]
*  to the very last one of them, including the leaders in Qatar. That but use that phrase [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=136.72s)]
*  bear hug. What they're going to do is, you know, a bear hug can go one way and it can [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=142.28s)]
*  go the other way. You can end up strangling somebody with a bear hug and they're going [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=145.96s)]
*  to keep squeezing and squeezing because that's been the instinct of this White House from [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=149.0s)]
*  the beginning. Maybe Joe's got some warm fuzzies about his support for Israel from the past, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=153.72s)]
*  but all the staffers, everyone else inside the White House is clearly far more in that [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=158.44s)]
*  blink ins at the front end of that. So your solution now is to push a two state solution [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=163.2s)]
*  with who who's in charge on the other side, a terror state. Now's our time to sweep in. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=167.95999999999998s)]
*  It's upside down. It's upside down to your point about the political lens of this. Emily, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=172.72s)]
*  take a look at these headlines. It's exactly underscoring what Pete just said. Washington [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=177.16s)]
*  Post White House grapples with internal divisions on Israel, Gaza, New York Times. Biden navigates [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=180.95999999999998s)]
*  divisions over Gaza inside the White House and beyond. You see NBC News, the Biden Obama [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=187.44s)]
*  divide over how closely to support Israel. The pressure on Biden is coming because young [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=191.76s)]
*  voters are fleeing him. Muslim voters are fleeing him and there's political pressure [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=197.07999999999998s)]
*  to bring those voters home before November. It also shows how ideologically feckle fickle [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=201.28s)]
*  the president has been because if he actually felt ideologically devoted and sound, if his [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  50 years being a part of this American government meant anything, then he would have stood firm [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=214.12s)]
*  from the beginning. But this is showing his true colors, which is A, susceptible to pressure [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=218.92s)]
*  and B, not being a forward thinking leader. And we think about his approach this entire [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=223.64s)]
*  time and Obama's just even worse, but it's essentially, you know, afraid of escalation [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=229.6s)]
*  and that fear of escalation has always meant that we have aligned our interests thus with [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=233.88s)]
*  the likes of Hamas and the likes of Russia, because in the fear of escalation, when we [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=240.27999999999997s)]
*  support to Ukraine, regardless of how you feel about it politically, we said Ukraine [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=246.11999999999998s)]
*  will support you, but we will give you this only will give you little bits and you can't [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=250.44s)]
*  defend yourself in this way against Russia and we're going to do it going to do it in [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=255.83999999999997s)]
*  this timely fashion. So they it draws everything out and it makes them unable to be successful. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=259.24s)]
*  And the same thing is now happening with Israel. So first of all, it's a slap in the face to [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=264.24s)]
*  our greatest ally. And secondly, it once again furthers the interest of Hamas because of [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=267.56s)]
*  our fear of escalation. We are stoking the global condemnation of Israel and we are meet [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=272.16s)]
*  we are not supporting them in their ability to defend themselves because we are joining [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=277.36s)]
*  that chorus. Oh, limit this. Oh, don't do this. Instead of saying we support you come [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=281.84000000000003s)]
*  hell or high water, whatever you need will be there. And Israel is probably like, we [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=286.44000000000005s)]
*  don't actually need you at all. We just need you to stand down and support us silently [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=289.6s)]
*  instead of meddling in the global affairs because right now Hamas is laughing, unfortunately [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=294.08000000000004s)]
*  and hideously that we are now the greatest leaders in condemning Israel's ability to [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=298.9s)]
*  full throatedly defend themselves. As Hamas is violating international law. I want to [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=303.85999999999996s)]
*  play this for you, Kennedy. So not only did Hamas violate the ceasefire, they're violating [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=308.06s)]
*  international law and not allowing the Red Cross to see the hostages. This is Ruby Chin [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=312.29999999999995s)]
*  speaking to Bill Hemmer. She's a 19 year old son who is a hostage. Listen to what she [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=316.53999999999996s)]
*  says. So according to the international law, the international that cost has a permanent [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=321.5s)]
*  mandate to visit hostages. If I could, Bill, just quote you the mission statement of the [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=329.7s)]
*  international Red Cross to protect the lives and dignity of victims in armed conflict and [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=336.14s)]
*  violence and provide them with assistance. When you look at the budget of the international [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=343.17999999999995s)]
*  Red Cross, 25% of it comes from U.S. taxpayers. I am a U.S. taxpayer. Why is it that the international [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=350.17999999999995s)]
*  that cost has not visited my son, a U.S. citizen, as well as the other hostages that require [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=359.09999999999997s)]
*  immediate medical attention? Now, Ruby deserves to see his son or at least have the Red Cross [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=364.62s)]
*  check on him. Yes, we deserve to know who is still alive, who has perished, who has [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=369.65999999999997s)]
*  been tortured to death. We don't have these answers. And I really feel for the families [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=375.14s)]
*  because they're stuck in the hardest place of all because obviously they want their family [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=379.29999999999995s)]
*  members to be among the 110 plus who are released during the ceasefire. And when the [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=383.42s)]
*  fighting starts up again, you know, their hearts have to sink. But at the same time, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=390.64000000000004s)]
*  they want more than anyone to send members of Hamas to hell. And you know, they're in [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=395.94s)]
*  the most difficult position of all. And to your point, I don't think the president has [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=401.42s)]
*  a foreign policy. I really don't. I think that he is fickle. He is incredibly spineless. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=406.58000000000004s)]
*  And you're seeing this because, you know, he will try and placate Israelis with words, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=412.08s)]
*  but then he sends Blinken with very different actions that feel like they are being authored [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=418.47999999999996s)]
*  by Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar. So, you know, and that makes it even harder for these families [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=422.91999999999996s)]
*  in the United States. No doubt. Yeah. Look, this whole problem with the Biden administration [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=429.24s)]
*  and those advising him is that there is no moral footing. We see it emerging throughout [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=433.9s)]
*  the country that there is just no moral sense of what is right, which is when leadership [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=438.32s)]
*  matters and they are placating to certain voters or voting blocks. And that's when [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=443.08s)]
*  you get lost. When this is when it matters is you've got to stand up. Now, Israel has [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=448.24s)]
*  played its part. They've gotten rid of, you know, in Syria and in Iraq, you know, nuclear [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=453.44s)]
*  power plants and things saving the Western world. Israel does know what it's doing. This [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=458.84s)]
*  is deliberate, clearly, and it is about what do they say versus what are they doing? And [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=463.8s)]
*  this is cannot be a suicide pact. And Israel knows that and they need to just move forward [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=469.64s)]
*  because Western civilization and humanity is at stake. That's right. This is a battle [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=474.6s)]
*  between good and it is a mosque in Israel. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJUqTaArkE&t=479.64s)]
