# 'VICIOUS CYCLE': Biden admin criticized over handling of hostage deal
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU)
*  Hello, everyone. I'm Alicia Acuna, along with Joey Jones, Nicole Sapphire, and Joe Concha. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=0.0s)]
*  The big story tonight is a Fox News alert. A third wave of hostages released by Hamas. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=5.4s)]
*  Among the 17 is 4-year-old Abigail Adon, an American Israeli girl whose parents were killed [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  in front of her by Hamas terrorists on October 7th. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=18.64s)]
*  We have Team Fox coverage tonight. Lucas Tomlinson is in Nantucket, Massachusetts, with President [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=22.2s)]
*  Biden's reaction, but first to Alex Hogan live in Jerusalem. Hi, Alex. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=27.72s)]
*  Hi, Alicia. As the third day of the ceasefire comes to an end, 14 Israeli hostages have been [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=32.04s)]
*  freed today. This brings the total to 40 Israeli hostages, 14 Thai hostages, and one Filipino. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=38.6s)]
*  And among them today is the very first American dual citizen, Abigail Adon. She was found covered [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=45.4s)]
*  in her parents' blood on October 7th when they were killed, and then she was taken hostage. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  Doctors say, however, as much as they are celebrating this 4-year-old who has now been [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=58.28s)]
*  released, there is one woman who is in dire condition, the eldest who was released today, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=64.44s)]
*  an 84-year-old woman who was airlifted to the hospital. Take a listen. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=68.84s)]
*  She has treated her emergency department after significant medical neglect for the past several [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=73.72s)]
*  weeks while being held by Hamas. She is currently in unstable condition with risk to her life. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=79.4s)]
*  It has been days of emotional video coming out of these family reunions. This is footage of Sharon [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=88.68s)]
*  Hertzman. She's there hugging her son. She was taken hostage along with her 12-year-old daughter [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=95.4s)]
*  who's hugging her father there before the parents eventually embrace. Noam, the 12-year-old, had [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  always wanted a dog, and her dad, speaking to the press, says that this little girl is now getting [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=106.52s)]
*  a puppy. These are the moments of celebration for people across Israel, and for those who have been [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=111.08s)]
*  reunited, it is relief mixed with a lot of guilt given that other families have not been so lucky. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=116.75999999999999s)]
*  She learned for the first time that her son, Hamas Moshe, survived, and the moment she saw him and [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=124.19999999999999s)]
*  hugging was an amazing moment. A moment of joy, and the community lost over 100 people that was [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=130.60000000000002s)]
*  kidnapped and some of them murdered. There is no town to return to, no house to return to, and there [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=139.88s)]
*  are other shocking news. It's a mix between joy and sadness. We have now entered the early hours of [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=148.44s)]
*  day four of the ceasefire when more hostages are expected to be released, and negotiators [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=156.52s)]
*  say they're hoping to prolong the ceasefire, something that we are hearing both from the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=161.56s)]
*  Israeli government and Hamas, that that is a goal that they intend to follow as well. Alicia? And [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=165.64000000000001s)]
*  we continue to think of all the families tonight. Alex Hogan in Jerusalem, thank you so much. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=171.96s)]
*  President Biden is back at the White House, returning earlier from Nantucket, where he [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=176.60000000000002s)]
*  appeared to take credit for getting Hamas to release the more than 50 hostages so far. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=181.56s)]
*  The proof that this is working and worth pursuing further is in every smile and every grateful tear [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=188.2s)]
*  we see on the faces of those families who are finally getting back together again. The proof [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=195.32s)]
*  is little Abigail. We go now live to Lucas Tomlinson, who's with the president. Lucas? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=201.72s)]
*  Alicia, tomorrow marks the last day of the four-day truce, and President Biden, speaking here in [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=211.96s)]
*  Nantucket before departing, says he wants to see that time period extended, the ceasefire extended [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=216.76s)]
*  to get more hostages out. He also mentioned he wants to redouble efforts to get the remaining [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=222.84s)]
*  American hostages out, up to eight remain tonight held captive inside Gaza. Have you extracted any [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=227.88s)]
*  guarantees about proof of life for other hostages, or do you have an expectation of how much longer [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=235.72s)]
*  you could push this pause? Well, look, you know the deal calls for every 10 hostages released to [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=241.72s)]
*  extend another day, so I'm hopeful this is not the end. It's going to continue. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=248.36s)]
*  Remember, these hostages that are being released have not seen the sunshine in over 50 days, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=255.32s)]
*  Alicia, of being held captive down inside those tunnels. President Biden seemed to take credit [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=260.12s)]
*  with his behind-the-scenes negotiations, as you mentioned earlier. This has been the product of [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=265.4s)]
*  a lot of hard work and weeks of personal engagement for me and my team. We have been [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=271.32s)]
*  in close contact with the leaders of Qatar, Egypt, and Israel, speaking with each one of them repeatedly [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=276.44s)]
*  over the past few weeks to help secure this deal. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=282.68s)]
*  Some Republican lawmakers say they wish they had seen more Americans hostages being released much [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=288.2s)]
*  earlier. I'm concerned that the Biden administration didn't make it a condition of this deal that [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=293.48s)]
*  Americans be in the first hostages that are released, especially since American aid is going [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=299.48s)]
*  into Gaza, right now, into northern Gaza as part of the conditions that Hamas had. I think [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=304.44s)]
*  when the administration says they know every detail and then tell you that they don't even [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=311.24s)]
*  know if they're alive, that is certainly concerning. The White House says President Biden spoke to [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=314.76s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu before leaving to return to the White House, guys. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=320.92s)]
*  Uka Somblinson, good to see you. Thank you so much. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=326.52000000000004s)]
*  So, Joey, I want to go to you first, and I think people really need to pay attention to this. One [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=330.04s)]
*  of the hostages who was released is a Russian national, and Hamas said that they did so, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=334.12s)]
*  quote, in response to the efforts of Russian President Vladimir Putin, a show of appreciation [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=340.36s)]
*  for Moscow's position on the war. So you take that statement, it really puts in stark relief the [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=346.84000000000003s)]
*  position of our American president and our American hostages in the job that he has that [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=352.04s)]
*  lies ahead. No, absolutely. The people from Thailand that were released were done so because [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=357.96000000000004s)]
*  of negotiations with Iran and Hamas, and so negotiations with Iran and Hamas. So I think [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=363.56s)]
*  it puts the president in a difficult place to sit there and have one American and have, I don't know, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=369.08000000000004s)]
*  upwards of nine or ten, I think now they're kind of unaccounted for. I've heard everywhere from [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=373.8s)]
*  three to ten, I'm not sure where the number is on confirmed Americans that are held hostage, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=377.8s)]
*  and to say that it took three days and a lot of back and forth and a lot of days of him getting [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=381.8s)]
*  some heat for not getting an American in that first group that came through, the first trunch. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=386.92s)]
*  But I think we have to take a step back and say, what does Hamas see those American hostages as? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=391.32s)]
*  Are they currency that buy their own lives back if Israel closes in enough? Is that why they're [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=396.84000000000003s)]
*  keeping a little bit closer grasp on the American hostages? Or do they maybe hit a place where they [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=402.2s)]
*  say, hey, we're going to give all the Americans back if the U.S. will calm down and not help Israel [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=407.4s)]
*  kill us? And so I'm not sure, I'm not sure what they see that currency as, but obviously, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=411.88s)]
*  interviewed Peter Lerner this morning, the IDF spokesperson said, listen, some hostages are seen [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=417.32s)]
*  as higher value to them than others. Yeah, and then we also have to conch not forget the Palestinian [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=421.23999999999995s)]
*  prisoners who have been released, and Fox Digital has an alarming story out today about what some of [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=427.56s)]
*  these newly released Palestinian terrorists may receive. Here's the headline. Biden admin accused [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=433.4s)]
*  of aiding Palestinian pay for slay as terrorists profit in Hamas deal experts claim from the report. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=439.79999999999995s)]
*  Many of the newly released convicted Palestinian terrorists who are part of a swap that secured [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=447.56s)]
*  the freedom of some Israeli and foreign hostages held by the terrorist movement Hamas could receive [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=452.67999999999995s)]
*  U.S. funds via the Palestinian Authority, an expert on the matter claimed he noted, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=458.12s)]
*  quote, every single terrorist gets a salary from the Palestinian Authority once they are imprisoned. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=462.92s)]
*  Conch. A salary to kidnap the elderly and young children like Abigail Don, who was released today, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=469.56s)]
*  celebrated her fourth birthday on Friday, and now she comes out not going home to her parents, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=476.12s)]
*  having witnessed them getting murdered. And somehow U.S. dollars are involved in facilitating [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=481.64s)]
*  this. The fear is that this is the new normal of warfare. Are we facilitating the ultimate [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=486.76s)]
*  incentive program to kidnap innocent civilians during these sort of conflicts in order to create [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=493.32s)]
*  leverage for X, Y, Z as far as getting Palestinian prisoners out? And by the way, not petty [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=499.96s)]
*  criminals like we talked about yesterday. These are people who tried to murder Israeli police [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=506.03999999999996s)]
*  officers, for example. So this is going to be a vicious cycle that if we continue to facilitate [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=509.64s)]
*  this from a monetary perspective, then what does this mean going forward? And what will terrorists [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=515.16s)]
*  do as far as the playbook, as far as not only attacks, but taking people against their will [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=519.48s)]
*  and then saying, OK, what are you going to give us now? And Nicole, you know, we're heading into [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=524.6s)]
*  the final day of this exchange that's supposed to occur. And it really kind of brings to mind [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=528.76s)]
*  what happens in the days after. And we can take a listen to the president here because he wants [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=533.3199999999999s)]
*  this to continue. This has been the product of a lot of hard work and weeks of personal engagement [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=537.4s)]
*  for me and my team. We've been in close contact with the leaders of Qatar, Egypt and Israel, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=543.64s)]
*  speaking with each one of them repeatedly over the past few weeks to help secure this deal. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=549.64s)]
*  So, Nicole, he wants to continue to extend it. And we he right now he only has one American [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=556.04s)]
*  in his slot that he's been able to account for, but he's taking credit. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=563.08s)]
*  Well, of course, the president is taking credit. But yet if you ask him about the remaining [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=566.52s)]
*  American hostages, he has no information on them. We don't know what condition they in. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=569.96s)]
*  We don't even know exactly how many they are. And the way I see it is we are funding both sides [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=573.4s)]
*  of this war now. We are supporting Israel, but we're also giving a lot of support and money [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=577.48s)]
*  to the Palestinians, to Gaza. And that is being funded and funneled through Hamas. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=582.12s)]
*  And at the end of the day, prolonging the ceasefire, calling for a permanent ceasefire [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=586.84s)]
*  without the complete destruction of Hamas just opens up Israel to another bloody massacre. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=591.16s)]
*  As Joe mentioned earlier, yes, it is so wonderful that Abigail was able to come home today, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BZ2eC5oZU&t=596.92s)]
