# IDF finds heavy rockets in Gaza terror raids
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oAeTMFKOhU)
*  Israeli soldiers say they found multiple heavyweight rockets and UAVs used by Islamic jihadists [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oAeTMFKOhU&t=0.0s)]
*  in a raid last night. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oAeTMFKOhU&t=11.08s)]
*  The rockets have a range of about 100 miles and explosive warheads weighing over 500 pounds. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oAeTMFKOhU&t=12.76s)]
*  The IDF also showing the inside of a Hamas tunnel uncovered in Gaza's biggest hospital. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oAeTMFKOhU&t=19.36s)]
*  Trey Yanks live on the ground in southern Israel with the latest. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oAeTMFKOhU&t=24.52s)]
*  Trey? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oAeTMFKOhU&t=26.96s)]
*  Yeah, hey Todd Carley, good morning. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oAeTMFKOhU&t=28.96s)]
*  Israeli forces continue to work their way deeper into Gaza City overnight releasing [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oAeTMFKOhU&t=31.64s)]
*  a video of what they say is a Hamas tunnel on the Al-Shifa hospital complex. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oAeTMFKOhU&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  Now it's important to note the Israelis have promised here they would be uncovering a Hamas [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oAeTMFKOhU&t=41.8s)]
*  headquarters. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oAeTMFKOhU&t=46.44s)]
*  We've not yet seen any evidence to support those claims, but they did release this video [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oAeTMFKOhU&t=47.44s)]
*  and photos showing what they say is a Hamas tunnel in addition to weapons inside the Radiology [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oAeTMFKOhU&t=51.44s)]
*  Department of Gaza's largest hospital. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oAeTMFKOhU&t=57.019999999999996s)]
*  Now Hamas has denied that they use the hospital as a headquarters and note that there are [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oAeTMFKOhU&t=59.9s)]
*  still hundreds of Palestinian patients receiving treatment there including dozens of babies [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oAeTMFKOhU&t=64.34s)]
*  who are in desperate need of medical support. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oAeTMFKOhU&t=69.7s)]
*  As this is taking place overnight we found out some horrific news about two of the hostages. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oAeTMFKOhU&t=72.25999999999999s)]
*  Their bodies were recovered near to the Al-Shifa complex. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oAeTMFKOhU&t=77.38s)]

*  the Gaza border, she was taken into Gaza on October 7th during the massacre. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oAeTMFKOhU&t=86.42s)]
*  Her husband was slaughtered and there was hope that she was still alive. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oAeTMFKOhU&t=91.61999999999999s)]
*  She's a mother of five children and she is someone who was receiving cancer treatment [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oAeTMFKOhU&t=95.08s)]

*  Additionally the Israelis recovered the body of Corporal Noah Marciano, a soldier, a 19 [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oAeTMFKOhU&t=104.06s)]
*  year old who was operating near the Gaza border when the massacre took place. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oAeTMFKOhU&t=109.94s)]
*  Hamas had released a hostage video with her in it and then at the end of the video an [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oAeTMFKOhU&t=114.5s)]
*  image of her body. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oAeTMFKOhU&t=119.06s)]
*  Today her funeral is being held in central Israel. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oAeTMFKOhU&t=120.54s)]
*  All of this is coming as the Israelis say they are starting to prepare for operations [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oAeTMFKOhU&t=124.06s)]
*  in the southern part of the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oAeTMFKOhU&t=128.54s)]
*  Reports indicate Israeli forces have dropped leaflets near Gaza's second largest city of [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oAeTMFKOhU&t=130.9s)]
*  Khan Yunis and as you noted they've uncovered what they say is a stockpile of rockets from [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oAeTMFKOhU&t=134.86s)]
*  Islamic Jihad. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oAeTMFKOhU&t=139.78s)]
*  Some of these rockets are quite large. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oAeTMFKOhU&t=141.1s)]
*  We're not sure if all of the rockets are in use. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oAeTMFKOhU&t=142.82s)]
*  Some of them could be props that Hamas and Islamic Jihad use in parades within Gaza but [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oAeTMFKOhU&t=146.62s)]
*  it's of note here the Israelis blowing up this facility that they say was a training [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oAeTMFKOhU&t=151.42s)]
*  facility for Hamas and Islamic Jihad as they continue to operate inside the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oAeTMFKOhU&t=155.22s)]
*  Todd, Carly. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oAeTMFKOhU&t=160.42s)]
