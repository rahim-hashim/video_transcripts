# 'Friends' star goes off on Hamas apologists
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [January 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE)
*  Well, Anita, another celebrity using their voice to advocate for the victims of Hamas's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=0.0s)]
*  brutality. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=5.08s)]
*  Friends co-star David Schwimmer taking to Instagram to call out skeptics of Hamas's [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=6.08s)]
*  sexual assaults. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=10.0s)]
*  He writes, quote, why do so many refuse to believe, despite all the evidence on camera [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=11.1s)]
*  and in testimony, the women, children and men brutally assaulted by terrorists on October [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=16.48s)]
*  7th? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=22.32s)]
*  Where is their outrage? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=23.32s)]
*  In the weeks and months that followed, it became clear their activism, their advocacy [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=24.76s)]
*  is conditional. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=28.6s)]
*  They'll fight like hell for all victims of sexual violence unless they're Jews. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=29.6s)]
*  Let's bring in Bethany Mandel, the co-author of Stolen Youth. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  And Bethany, David Schwimmer references a specific article from The New York Times. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=37.52s)]
*  It's entitled Screams Without Words, How Hamas Weaponized Sexual Violence on October 7th. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=43.52s)]
*  What happened and why aren't more people talking about it? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=51.44s)]
*  The brutality that The New York Times were able to document over the course of months [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=56.8s)]
*  of research is really horrifying. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=61.959999999999994s)]
*  And I think anyone who has sort of gotten a big picture view of what Hamas did on October [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=64.75999999999999s)]
*  7th, even those folks are going to be shocked by the level of brutality that was documented [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  by The New York Times. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=75.16s)]
*  Things that honestly we can't really talk about on television. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=77.32s)]
*  And I really urge all of your viewers to go read The New York Times piece. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=79.88s)]
*  And that's not something I say very often. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=84.32s)]
*  But The New York Times did a really, really important thing here. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=86.36s)]
*  And it's important that everyone read it, both left and right. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=89.88s)]
*  I mean, this was there was a lot of good research done here. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=94.12s)]
*  This was real journalism that we don't often see from The New York Times. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  But Schwimmer is right. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=101.36s)]
*  What's really disturbing is in the face of all of that, there are still so many deniers. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=102.56s)]
*  I mean, these are these are Holocaust deniers. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=108.28s)]
*  These are modern day Holocaust deniers. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=110.12s)]
*  And Schwimmer rightly says, you know, all of these folks who said believe all women and [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=112.36s)]
*  they are for women's rights and talking about sexual violence against women for the last [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=117.36s)]
*  20, 30 years, where are they? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=122.52000000000001s)]
*  The vast majority of them are silent. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  And that goes from regular celebrities up to the UN. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=126.84s)]
*  Is David Schwimmer alone here? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=131.96s)]
*  Have other actors joined him? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=134.04000000000002s)]
*  Do you think other actors will join him? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=135.64000000000001s)]
*  I mean, there's honestly not that many who have come out and said something. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=137.6s)]
*  Deborah Messing has been fantastic. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  Another one is Jenny Mullen. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=143.84s)]
*  She's Jason Biggs' husband, but she's honestly better than Jason Biggs. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=147.2s)]
*  So I don't even want to describe her as Jason Biggs' husband, but she's fantastic. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=150.72s)]
*  I mean, there have been really wonderful, bright lights. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=154.28s)]
*  Jerry Seinfeld and his wife, also Jessica, have been fantastic. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=157.28s)]
*  But there are few and far between. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=161.28s)]
*  Mayim Bialik, another one. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=162.88s)]
*  But all of them are Jewish. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=165.2s)]
*  There have been no non-Jewish celebrities who have come out and said believe all women, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=168.0s)]
*  even when they're Jews. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=172.0s)]
*  And you look at the situation and you hear from some of the voices who say you have to [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=173.6s)]
*  look at the context, you have to look at the history. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=177.83999999999997s)]
*  But why is it so difficult to look at such brutality and just call it out for what it is? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=180.32s)]
*  Yeah, I would like to know what the appropriate context is for the brutal, brutal sexual [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=186.56s)]
*  assault of children and elderly women and young women at a music festival. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=194.39999999999998s)]
*  There is no context for that. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=198.64s)]
*  And what they're saying is it's okay to do this by saying that it's acceptable and it's [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  okay to ask for context in certain circumstances. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=208.0s)]
*  They're saying under some circumstances, it's okay to brutally rape and kill women [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=210.95999999999998s)]
*  as long as they're Jewish. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=217.12s)]
*  That is textbook anti-Semitism and deeply, deeply disturbing. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=219.12s)]
*  And it's something that all of these keyboard warriors should have been talking about for [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=224.0s)]
*  the last two months, but they've been sort of sitting back on their heels because [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=229.28s)]
*  apparently when it's a brutal terror attack against Jews, we have to wait and see. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=233.2s)]
*  Bethany Mandel, thanks for joining us this afternoon. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6732kPauyYE&t=239.04s)]
