# Bodycam video shows moment NYPD breached Columbia University building
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [May 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ)
*  This brand new body paint video showing what it looked like for NYPD officers breaching [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=0.0s)]
*  a Columbia University building overtaken by anti-Israel protesters. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=4.64s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=8.4s)]
*  AVI FEDERGRAND IS A PROFESSOR AT COLUMBIA SCHOOL OF BUSINESS. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=9.4s)]
*  HE JOINS ME. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=31.68s)]
*  AVI, WHAT'S YOUR REACTION WHEN YOU SEE SCENES LIKE THAT PLAYING OUT AT THE SCHOOL THAT EMPLOYS [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=32.68s)]
*  YOU WHERE YOU WORK AS A PROFESSOR? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=37.76s)]
*  First of all, thank you for having me. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=39.76s)]
*  It's a pleasure to be here. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=44.72s)]
*  I'm obviously incredibly distressed by all the scenes that are happening here. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=47.4s)]
*  I think what has played out in the last six months is an absolute travesty and unfortunately [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=52.36s)]
*  university administrations have failed to step up to the plate and do what they need [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=60.56s)]
*  to do. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=64.44s)]
*  It is also very clear that the simultaneous outburst of all these different riots and [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=66.44s)]
*  events in such volumes at different campuses is not a happenstance, but it shows what is [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=75.36s)]
*  now coming out from the data of the NYPD that this was organized and instigated by outside [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=85.08s)]
*  forces, many of whom participated in the riots. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=93.12s)]
*  And it's something that's really deplorable and it's something that we should investigate [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=97.76s)]
*  very seriously. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=104.56s)]
*  We should investigate and trace very seriously. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=105.56s)]
*  To that point, according to the NYPD, roughly half of the protesters arrested at Columbia [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  and City College, roughly half of them, had no, zero affiliation to either school. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=112.64000000000001s)]
*  So to your point, Avi, now that our assumptions about the outside agitators have been proven [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=118.56s)]
*  true by the data, what should be done about it? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=123.64s)]
*  How can we stop this from happening again? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=126.92s)]
*  What do you want to see done? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=129.0s)]
*  So what I want to see done is that we should do a very intensive trace of who these outsiders [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=131.8s)]
*  were and in particular who organized and financed them. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=139.04s)]
*  We now already have through various publications in the media, maybe not conclusive, but very [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=144.88s)]
*  convincing evidence that certain individuals such as George Soros, the billionaire who's [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=154.76s)]
*  also been funding many campaigns of Democrats, have actually provided funds for this. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=161.08s)]
*  And I wouldn't be surprised, this has not been proven yet, but I wouldn't be surprised [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=169.48000000000002s)]
*  if some of the money and some of the organizations came from Iran and its proxies. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=172.96s)]
*  It's extremely important that we trace this and that we find out where the money is coming [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=178.04000000000002s)]
*  from and who is behind that in order to prevent a future where this is going to be a repetitive [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=182.60000000000002s)]
*  scene. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=188.24s)]
*  You heard Iran cheering this on. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=189.24s)]
*  They basically said, hey, come to University of Tehran, we'll give you a free scholarship. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=193.28s)]
*  And that just sort of goes to your point, really drives it home. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=198.56s)]
*  I know you're in the business school, but I got to get your thoughts on what happened [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=202.2s)]
*  over at the law school. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=205.4s)]
*  Editors of the Columbia Law Review are calling on the school to cancel their final exams [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=206.4s)]
*  because of, quote, the alleged trauma caused by police presence on campus. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=211.88s)]
*  They wrote in part, the violence we witnessed has irrevocably shaken many of us on the review. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=215.84s)]
*  We know this to be the same for many of our classmates. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=221.51999999999998s)]
*  Videos have circulated of police clad in riot gear mocking and brutalizing our students. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=224.48s)]
*  The events of last night left us and many of our peers unable to focus and highly emotional [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=229.6s)]
*  during this tumultual time. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=234.6s)]
*  What do you make of law students? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  Those on the law review are supposed to be the best and brightest and many of whom will [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=238.32s)]
*  become officers of the court upon graduation, being so shaken by the mere sight of police, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=242.12s)]
*  a huge component of our laws that they are asking for their exams to be canceled, Avi? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=249.92s)]
*  Well, I have absolutely no sympathy for that view. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=256.48s)]
*  First of all, these activities were nobody forced upon them, people that chose to be [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=260.15999999999997s)]
*  part of them that took this on their own initiative. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=266.96s)]
*  And to use this as an excuse for delay of exams is absolutely unacceptable and should [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=272.28s)]
*  never be considered. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=279.8s)]
*  And I hope that the various university administrations will never do. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=280.8s)]
*  It is indeed very scary to think that these same students might be in very important positions [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=285.36s)]
*  or are likely to be in very important positions in the future. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=291.32s)]
*  And as I said before, it is therefore exceedingly important to trace from where the financing [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=295.24s)]
*  and the organization of all of these events took place, in particular in light of the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=305.2s)]
*  statistics that are coming out that close to half of the participants are indeed not [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=309.16s)]
*  affiliated at all with the university. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=315.84000000000003s)]
*  To your point, if seeing a cop makes you unable to study for an exam, the pressure cooker [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=319.76000000000005s)]
*  of law, this may not be the profession for you. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=323.32000000000005s)]
*  Let's just leave it there. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=326.32000000000005s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=327.56s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilme. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G534Fx5HyTQ&t=328.56s)]
