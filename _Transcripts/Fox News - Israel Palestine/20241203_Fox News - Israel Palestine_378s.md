# 'ALL HELL TO PAY': Trump demands Hamas release hostages before inauguration
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk)
*  The Congressional subcommittee on the coronavirus pandemic is closing out its two-year investigation [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=0.0s)]
*  after finding that COVID-19 likely came from a lab in Wuhan, China. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=6.88s)]
*  The subcommittee reporting that the virus had a biological characteristic that could [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=11.16s)]
*  not be found in nature. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=15.68s)]
*  The report also says that social distancing and wearing masks were not backed by scientific [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=17.96s)]
*  data and that American children lost, quote, decades worth of academic progress. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  Let's bring in John Elliott, who is a former Trump national security aide and author of [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=29.8s)]
*  the new book, The Biden-Harris Betrayal, Weak and Woke on the World Stage. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=33.28s)]
*  John, your reaction to the House's findings. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=38.32s)]
*  Well, Todd, good morning. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=41.08s)]
*  Look, this is something that we've known now. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=43.160000000000004s)]
*  They've been looking at this for two years, but we knew way back when Rand Paul was taking [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=44.68s)]
*  it right to Tony Fauci in that hearing, and Tony Fauci wouldn't answer any of his questions [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=49.2s)]
*  directly about whether it came from the lab, but more importantly, what he didn't answer [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=53.92s)]
*  in that session with Rand Paul was whether or not he profited in any way from the research [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=57.92s)]
*  that went in both to the vaccine and also the research that was done in that lab. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=64.04s)]
*  So this is not telling us anything new, but what it does, it gives a stamp of authority [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=67.64s)]
*  onto what most people suspect is that this, look, Fauci was all over the place. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=71.88s)]
*  He was talking about masking, saying it didn't work. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=76.08s)]
*  Then he said, you've got a mask. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=78.6s)]
*  Then he said, you need double masks. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=80.12s)]
*  Then he said, maybe you don't, et cetera. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=81.64s)]
*  So he was all over the place. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=83.44s)]
*  When we were at the White House National Security Council early on in the pandemic, we worked [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=84.52s)]
*  directly with Tony Fauci. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=88.96s)]
*  And look, back then, he was all over the place. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=90.48s)]
*  And so this subcommittee report, once again, it just reinforces what most Americans know [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=92.52s)]
*  is that this didn't come from some bat in some Wuhan lab or in some kind of a wet market. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=97.28s)]
*  Instead, it came from a lab that was completely generated, in some cases reportedly funded [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=104.12s)]
*  by U.S. taxpayer dollars. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=108.72s)]
*  OK, so is this it or does something else follow this? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=111.12s)]
*  Once President Trump takes office, Republicans take the Senate and the House maintains its [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=115.64s)]
*  Republican control? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=121.38s)]
*  Well, what I think, Todd, is that you're going to see a lot more oversight of this because [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  Americans are really tired. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=128.0s)]
*  I mean, we lost, to your point about the children. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=129.4s)]
*  Look, also old people who are in who are in old folks' homes, et cetera, they would not [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=131.48s)]
*  even be seen by their relatives as they passed away under this lockdown. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=136.24s)]
*  So nobody wants to see this happen again. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=140.08s)]
*  And this is why there's going to be real accountability. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=142.56s)]
*  Once again, this ties a bow on it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=145.12s)]
*  And this is a way that Congress can now say, look, we want to make sure that this never, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=146.58s)]
*  ever happens again. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=151.08s)]
*  And we have this bogus science at the top and all this masking mandates that really [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=152.42000000000002s)]
*  hurt the American people. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=156.68s)]
*  We certainly will be watching. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=157.76000000000002s)]
*  Meantime, President-elect Trump wants a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza before Inauguration [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  Day. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  Writing on Truth Social, please let this truth serve to represent that if the hostages are [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=165.48000000000002s)]
*  not released prior to January 20th, 2025, the date that I proudly assume office as [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=169.6s)]
*  president of the United States, there will be all hell to pay in the Middle East. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=174.51999999999998s)]
*  John, what could that hell look like? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=179.64s)]
*  And why hasn't President Biden unleashed that same hell over the course of the last 14 months [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=182.4s)]
*  to get those hostages home? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=188.18s)]
*  Well, that's the question, Todd, is that, look, that's the power of the United States. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=189.84s)]
*  But what you need is you need a leader like President Trump. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=193.88s)]
*  Look, he showed he basically bankrupted Iran by taking the fight to them, killing Soleimani. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=196.48s)]
*  And they had—putting sanctions on them where they were only $7 billion in cash reserves [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=203.0s)]
*  right before President Trump left office. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=209.16s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  Now they have over $80 billion of cash reserves under President Biden. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  So all of the Middle East is laughing at the Biden leadership. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=215.64s)]
*  And so, look, this is President Trump putting it in all caps. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=219.07999999999998s)]
*  Do you remember back in 1980 when Ronald Reagan said the same thing to the Iranians [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=221.56s)]
*  with our hostages over there? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=225.76s)]
*  He said, don't wait until I come into office because you're not going to like it. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=227.07999999999998s)]
*  This is the same thing, yet it's on steroids with President Trump because people have seen [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=230.84s)]
*  him four years ago and the way he acts in the Middle East, and he's going to bring it [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=235.07999999999998s)]
*  right back to them. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=238.38s)]
*  I remember reading about that Reagan thing because I was only two at the time, John. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=239.38s)]
*  But getting back to the serious matter here, do you think a ceasefire and hostage deal [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=243.07999999999998s)]
*  ultimately happens by Inauguration Day? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=247.16s)]
*  Well, this hostage deal is very simple. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=250.44s)]
*  The Hamas are going to look in right now to President Trump coming in office and they [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  have one. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=258.52s)]
*  They can end this right now, return the hostages, surrender. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=259.64s)]
*  And that's what's going to be the terms. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=262.92s)]
*  There's not going to be a negotiation in terms of getting them out. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=264.12s)]
*  They need to just return the hostages, period. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=267.3s)]
*  These are being held now for over a year. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=269.82s)]
*  And this is something that is not acceptable. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=273.14s)]
*  And President Trump is going to make them come to the table, return the hostages and [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=274.96s)]
*  essentially sue for peace. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=279.98s)]
*  Meantime, Ukrainian President Zelensky signals he would be open to a peace deal with Russia. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=281.59999999999997s)]
*  Wall Street Journal reporting in exchange. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=286.76s)]
*  He wants to join NATO. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=289.28s)]
*  He wants to make sure Ukraine gets NATO membership. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=291.08s)]
*  Do you see that happening? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=293.67999999999995s)]
*  Well, everybody in NATO has said that that is something that is off the table. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=295.91999999999996s)]
*  But look, he's trying to negotiate this. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=300.76s)]
*  The best thing about the negotiation is that everybody knows with President Trump coming [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=303.44s)]
*  into office, he's the art of the deal. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=306.91999999999996s)]
*  He knows how to get these things done. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=309.03999999999996s)]
*  And so for Biden at the last minute to be providing an extra arms package there and [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=311.04s)]
*  to try to get the negotiation going, that is something that really President Trump's [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=316.24s)]
*  going to solve this on his own terms and that he's the decision maker on these things. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=320.16s)]
*  And that's why the President Trump was reelected by Americans. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=324.40000000000003s)]
*  So just to be clear, you don't think the $725 million that we are sending now, new [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=327.6s)]
*  money to Ukraine, is money well spent? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=332.40000000000003s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=336.48s)]
*  Look, when two sides are going to come together and you have one side, Russia, that is the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=338.48s)]
*  stronger side, why before those negotiations are you going to clock them in the nose and [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=342.8s)]
*  then expect them to come to the table and not treat you differently at that point? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=347.8s)]
*  They need to bring both sides together. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=351.72s)]
*  And once again, President Trump's going to make that happen. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=353.0s)]
*  And to provide these additional weapons right at the last minute is something that, look, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=355.44s)]
*  it is not helpful for the negotiations once President Trump gets in office. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=360.84000000000003s)]
*  John Elliott, thank you for your time on all these topics. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=364.52000000000004s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs-NZj8CEk&t=366.76s)]
