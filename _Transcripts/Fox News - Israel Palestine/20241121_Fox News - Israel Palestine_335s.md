# Bernie Sanders torched for effort to block weapons for Israel: 'OUTRAGEOUS'
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y)
*  A vote to stop sending weapons to Israel overwhelmingly failing in the Senate, but that did not stop [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=0.0s)]
*  19 Senate Democrats led by Bernie Sanders from supporting it. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=5.38s)]
*  But while some Democrats want to stop supporting Israel, the incoming Republican majority is [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  making its stance clear. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=13.68s)]
*  To our allies in Israel and to the Jewish people around the world, my message to you [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=15.56s)]
*  is this. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=21.82s)]
*  Reinforcements are on the way. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=23.32s)]
*  The Republicans reclaim the majority in six weeks. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=26.72s)]
*  And when we would, when we do, we will make clear that the United States Congress stands [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=30.24s)]
*  squarely in Israel's corner. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=34.64s)]
*  Mike Huckabee has been appointed to be U.S. Ambassador to Israel by President-elect Trump, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=36.48s)]
*  and he joins us now. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  I believe your proper title is now Ambassador Designate Huckabee, and we congratulate you [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=43.76s)]
*  wholeheartedly on this, this position and this honor. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  It's clear that Israel does not have the support of the United States in all corners of the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=54.44s)]
*  country, given that 19 senators just voted to block U.S. arms sales to Israel, which [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=59.24s)]
*  is our greatest ally in the Middle East. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=64.88s)]
*  And Bernie Sanders led this effort, and he said that the reason we should do this, one [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=67.52s)]
*  of the reasons is because Israel is run by religious zealots. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  What is your reaction to Bernie Sanders and this effort yesterday? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=76.32s)]
*  Bernie is wrong on this, as he is about economic policy, and it's very unfortunate. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=81.48s)]
*  I want to be clear, I can't speak as an ambassador because I've got to go through Senate confirmation. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=86.04s)]
*  I'm honored that the president has asked me to take this role, and I hope that I'll get [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=90.76s)]
*  through the Senate process. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=95.92s)]
*  Until then, I'm certainly not speaking for the administration, the future one or the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  current one. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=102.12s)]
*  But I want to be very clear. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=103.16s)]
*  It's just as outrageous that these 19 senators don't understand what an ally means and why [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=105.84s)]
*  we need Israel as a strong ally and why they're important to us. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=111.48s)]
*  This should be one of the most bipartisan and overwhelming understandings, and we're [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  not asking to give things to Israel, but to sell them the things that they need to protect [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=120.72s)]
*  themselves against the annihilation that is intended toward them from Iran and from their [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=126.56s)]
*  proxies, Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=132.2s)]
*  This should be an easy call, and I don't know why these 19 senators are more in favor [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=135.1s)]
*  of terror than they are in peace. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=139.76s)]
*  How do you think our relationship with Israel will change when President Trump enters office? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=142.46s)]
*  President Trump was the most effective president in history when it comes to Israel in bringing [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=148.06s)]
*  about a level of peace and security for the Jewish state. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=154.06s)]
*  He moved the embassy. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=157.78s)]
*  He recognized the Golan Heights. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=159.14s)]
*  He recognized Jerusalem as the eternal capital of the Jewish state. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=161.24s)]
*  There were so many ways in which President Trump really brought forward, and the historic [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=165.46s)]
*  Abraham Accords should have earned him the Nobel Peace Prize, and the only reason it [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=170.8s)]
*  didn't was because there were people who were just prejudiced against him. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=175.16s)]
*  But that was a breakthrough, a sizable breakthrough that hopefully he'll be able to build upon, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=179.04000000000002s)]
*  and I have every confidence that he will. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=185.0s)]
*  It seems whenever we refer to Israel, they weren't head-scratcher. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=187.12s)]
*  Head-scratcher always comes into play. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=191.0s)]
*  This decision that you guys were just talking about to vote against sending arms to Israel, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=192.70000000000002s)]
*  head-scratcher, and then there's this, the U.S. vetoing a draft resolution on the Gaza [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=197.36s)]
*  ceasefire during the U.N. Security Council vote because we wanted to make sure that a [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=200.70000000000002s)]
*  ceasefire included the hostages. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=206.8s)]
*  Governor Huckabee, how could it not include the hostages? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=212.12s)]
*  I mean, they've done nothing wrong. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=215.16s)]
*  They were kidnapped. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=217.26s)]
*  They've been in captivity for over a year. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=218.34s)]
*  Why not include them? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=221.17999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, for over 400 days, Todd, the hostages have been held, and it's really pathetic [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=222.82s)]
*  that at least seven of those hostages are U.S. citizens. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=230.26s)]
*  We don't hear anything about that, and I really do appreciate the fact that the Biden administration [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=233.82s)]
*  in the U.N. did stop that from happening, this ridiculous resolution. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=239.34s)]
*  It was absurd and insulting. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=244.94s)]
*  But to say that we're going to have some type of ceasefire without getting those hostages [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=247.1s)]
*  back is an insult to anyone's intelligence, and I'm glad the U.S. decided to spike that [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=251.98s)]
*  one right in the ground. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=258.3s)]
*  I want to get a reaction to this. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=259.3s)]
*  New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, who was a Biden backer, he recently said Donald [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=260.98s)]
*  Trump has a chance to be a historic president with a major Middle East deal. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=265.7s)]
*  He writes, quote, Trump was the rare American president who actually put out a detailed [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=269.42s)]
*  plan for coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=275.46000000000004s)]
*  If that Trump revives that initiative in 2025, he could be remembered as the president who [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=278.66s)]
*  preserved Israel as a Jewish democracy and helped to securely birth a Palestinian state [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=283.82s)]
*  alongside it. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=289.1s)]
*  Is that possible under the president elect? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=290.46000000000004s)]
*  I think anybody that knows Donald Trump understands that there's very few people on earth who [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=294.3s)]
*  can put a deal together any better than he can. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=299.62s)]
*  So I'm convinced that if there's any hope for resolving what has been a longstanding [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=302.42s)]
*  conflict, Donald Trump's going to find a way to do it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=307.26s)]
*  And I go back to the Abraham Accords. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=309.94s)]
*  No one thought that was possible, but it not only was possible, it was done. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=311.58000000000004s)]
*  And if he'd still been in office, I think we would have seen it expand even more. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=315.98s)]
*  That's right. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=319.78000000000003s)]
*  Governor Huckabee, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=320.78000000000003s)]
*  Congratulations on the nomination. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=322.78000000000003s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNwp4lSU1Y&t=324.3s)]
