# This is a ‘pin prick’ response to Iran: Former ambassador-at-large
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ)
*  For more on this, we are joined by former Ambassador-at-Large and Coordinator for Counterterrorism, Nathan Sales. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Ambassador, thanks for being with us. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=5.24s)]
*  Great to be here. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=7.24s)]
*  You know, one thing that Trey said that stood out to me is that Hamas is trying to frame Israel [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=8.24s)]
*  as not allowing these hostage negotiations to move forward. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=14.0s)]
*  We know that the Israelis believe broadly that Hamas is playing for time here. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=17.76s)]
*  What's your view of what's happening right now and how that's factoring into – [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=22.44s)]
*  We saw a bit of a lull between when this intensified strike began and, you know, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=26.36s)]
*  the beginnings of this ground operation because of the hostage situation. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=31.56s)]
*  Well, Jackie, it's a little rich for Hamas, of all people, to be blaming Israel for the situation with hostages. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=35.76s)]
*  There's a very simple out. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  Hamas can let the 229 hostages go. Game over, right? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=43.0s)]
*  So I do think there is some risk that Hamas is going to try to drag this out, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=46.96s)]
*  dangle the hope of some sort of diplomatic resolution for the hostages in order to prevent [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=52.68s)]
*  Israel from coming in heavy into Gaza. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=58.0s)]
*  And as Americans, as the administration needs to be very clear not to play that game, not [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=60.6s)]
*  to give Hamas an opening to exploit daylight between the United States and Israel, we've [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=65.68s)]
*  started to hear some chatter, some anonymous leaks in the press where the administration [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=71.8s)]
*  is saying, well, we don't really support a ground invasion or, you know, you don't [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=76.56s)]
*  have strategic achievable objectives. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=80.72s)]
*  That is the sort of ankle biting that's going to create opportunities for Hamas to exploit [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=83.52s)]
*  daylight between Washington and Jerusalem. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=89.68s)]
*  Do you think that's happened at all yet? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=91.56s)]
*  Because we were, you know, we've been hearing that this ground operation was imminent for [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=93.56s)]
*  a long time now. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=97.44s)]
*  I mean, even yesterday we have reporting that it was set to begin around noon Eastern and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=98.44s)]
*  instead of sending in that First Division that they plan to do, they did, you know, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=104.44s)]
*  these intensified air and naval strikes, didn't send in the full division they plan to send [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=108.52s)]
*  in a more limited force, trying to basically rattle them one more time and see if they [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=114.28s)]
*  could make any progress with the hostages. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=118.08s)]
*  But more broadly, we've seen this imminent ground invasion be delayed for quite a while. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=119.72s)]
*  Well that's right. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=126.0s)]
*  And we don't really have good visibility on what's going on behind the scenes. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=127.0s)]
*  It could be the case that Israel is pumping the brakes in order to facilitate these diplomatic [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=130.6s)]
*  talks. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=135.92s)]
*  It's also consistent with preparation of the environment. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=136.95999999999998s)]
*  It may simply be that Israel has a plan of degrading various Hamas capabilities in a [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=140.28s)]
*  run-up to a more ambitious, more heavy footprint operation. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=146.67999999999998s)]
*  So we really don't know. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=151.7s)]
*  Soften the target and gather some intel, you're saying. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=152.7s)]
*  Destroy weapons caches, destroy command and control, take out leadership, disrupt communications. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=155.48s)]
*  All of those things need to happen in advance of a ground invasion. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=160.39999999999998s)]
*  That may be what's happening too. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=163.64s)]
*  I also want to ask you, the president has been praised on the right even for his Israel [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=165.04s)]
*  response. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=172.16s)]
*  But he's getting now some resistance from the left. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=173.39999999999998s)]
*  You had 18 House Democrats sign onto a resolution that called for an immediate de-escalation [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=175.55999999999997s)]
*  in Israel and occupied Palestine. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=181.39999999999998s)]
*  That phrase stood out to me. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=185.44s)]
*  And even former President Obama warned that any Israeli military strategy that ignores [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=187.51999999999998s)]
*  the human costs of war could ultimately backfire. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=193.44s)]
*  Are we seeing a problem potentially for the president within his own party growing before [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=196.8s)]
*  our eyes? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=204.8s)]
*  That's a real worry, Jackie. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=206.64s)]
*  I think it's troubling when you have a number of members of Congress who say that they're [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=207.96s)]
*  not going to join a bipartisan resolution condemning Hamas. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=213.16s)]
*  This is step one of any way of thinking about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=216.88s)]
*  If you can't condemn Hamas for beheading people, setting people on fire, shooting babies in [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=221.56s)]
*  their cribs, then we don't have a lot of common ground to talk. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=226.92000000000002s)]
*  I think the president has been very strong rhetorically in talking about the need for [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=230.72s)]
*  Israel to defend itself. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=234.84s)]
*  What we're going to need to see from the White House is actions that match the words. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=236.56s)]
*  When it comes to Iran in particular, we have not yet seen that. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=240.78s)]
*  We've seen a pinprick strike in response to a campaign of terror against American soldiers [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=243.96s)]
*  across the Middle East. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=249.66000000000003s)]
*  A hundred times since President Biden took office, Iran and its proxies have hit American [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=251.32s)]
*  soldiers. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=255.76s)]
*  We've responded six times. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=256.76s)]
*  You think you should have gotten harder with those airstrikes in Syria? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=257.76s)]
*  You've got to go harder than blowing up a couple of empty warehouses in the desert. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=260.4s)]
*  You need to send a clear message. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=264.96s)]
*  The way to do that is to take out leadership, take out command and control. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=266.59999999999997s)]
*  The reason to do that is to avoid Iran thinking that it can escalate us into a regional war. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=270.68s)]
*  We're out of time. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=276.44s)]
*  Ambassador Nathan Sales, thanks so much for being with us on the Saturday. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=277.44s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=280.76s)]
*  Thanks, Jackie. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vZeTI_R8aQ&t=281.26s)]
