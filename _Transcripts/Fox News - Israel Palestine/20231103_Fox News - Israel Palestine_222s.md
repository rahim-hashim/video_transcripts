# Hezbollah leader praises Hamas terror attack as ‘heroic’
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg)
*  So now, team Fox coverage begins anew. Rich Edson, State Department, Trey Yanks live in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=0.0s)]
*  southern Israel where it is almost nightfall on another day of war. Trey, hello. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=4.4s)]
*  Yeah, hey Bill, good morning. We've been watching that speech by Hassan Nasrallah, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=12.0s)]
*  the leader of Hezbollah. He's been talking for more than an hour now discussing the initial [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=15.6s)]
*  massacre on October 7th here in southern Israel, not surprisingly praising the Palestinian factions, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=20.32s)]
*  Hamas and Islamic Jihad for what he called heroic efforts. And remember, those efforts were the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=26.24s)]
*  slaughter of women and children, civilians in their homes. But it cuts to the core of the ideology [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=31.52s)]
*  here of the leader of Hezbollah who has been tiptoeing around direct involvement in the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=36.8s)]
*  conflict. I will give you one line though that is important to note. Many analysts will discuss [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=41.92s)]
*  this. He says, some claim we are about to engage in the war. We have been engaged since October 8th. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=46.16s)]
*  We've seen that rocket fire and mortar fire from southern Lebanon into northern Israel. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=51.84s)]
*  Hezbollah ramping up attacks overnight against Israeli forces that are now responding with [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=56.160000000000004s)]
*  airstrikes in southern Lebanon. But still a question about how much the Lebanese militant [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  group Hezbollah intends to get involved in this battle. Here on the southern front, we've seen [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=66.0s)]
*  Israeli troops today operating behind me inside the Gaza Strip. I do want to just step out of the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=70.4s)]
*  frame and let my cameraman, Yaniv, zoom in here. We've been watching as tanks and bulldozers [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=75.04s)]
*  operate on the edge of Gaza. I even saw a D-9 armored bulldozer destroying a house earlier today. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=80.16s)]
*  And it gives you a sense of how the Israelis are operating. They're looking to destroy any of the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=86.88s)]
*  places that Hamas militants could hide and also destroy those tunnel exits where Hamas has been [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=90.72s)]
*  ambushing Israeli forces. They have killed 24 Israeli soldiers, we are told, since the Friday [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=96.56s)]
*  night operation started. The Israelis pushing deeper in and the chief of staff in Israel saying [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  that the Israeli forces have now surrounded Gaza City. Again, the street to street battles [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=108.08s)]
*  are expected to continue throughout the day today and for weeks to come. We do know the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=113.2s)]
*  destruction will be focused on the northern part of the Gaza Strip as Israeli troops look to [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=117.75999999999999s)]
*  continue support from their artillery units that you hear in the distance and also their air force [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  overhead. But it will be a challenging battle and Israel says it may take months to complete. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=127.28s)]
*  Phil? Trey, you may have been listening to our question to Tal Heimrich a moment ago about [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=132.32s)]
*  negotiations for hostages. Do you, she would not answer the question, understandably, she did not [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=135.76s)]
*  want to give away strategy. Do you have any information on where that stands now? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  We do. We've been talking with the negotiators who are trying to cut those deals behind the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=148.56s)]
*  scenes. And remember the Israelis say 241 people are currently being held inside Gaza. We talked [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  with a number of sources who are familiar with those negotiations. They say they stalled last [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=160.4s)]
*  weekend whenever this initial ground push began. That was Friday. And then remember we reported to [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=165.84s)]
*  you that a high ranking Israeli official actually traveled to Doha and was on the ground meeting with [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=171.36s)]
*  Qatari negotiators. The source telling Fox News that the conversations then resumed and since then [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=176.8s)]
*  have been quote productive. And so those conversations are ongoing. Hamas is delivering [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=182.32s)]
*  messages through the Qataris. The Israelis are trying to put their terms on the table. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=187.36s)]
*  But we do know according to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who is meeting today [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=191.68s)]
*  with, and you can hear that outgoing artillery in the distance, who is meeting today with US [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=196.96s)]
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken, there will be no ceasefire or pause in the fighting unless [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=200.24s)]
*  some hostages are released. Bill? Trey, thanks. Trey Yinks, more from Southern Israel. Thank you. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=205.52s)]
*  We'll catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsjXdexf3Jg&t=217.36s)]
