# ‘WHERE ARE YOU?’: Netanyahu calls out UN over Hamas atrocities against Israeli women
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ)
*  Alright, so we're going to continue to monitor the Pentagon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=0.0s)]
*  We're going to head to Tel Aviv now, where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is now briefing. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=2.2s)]
*  Let's listen here. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=7.44s)]
*  Our generation is a continuation of the Maccabees. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=8.44s)]
*  Today, as in the past, they are fighting with tremendous courage and determination. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  And today, as in the past, we'll pray together for the safety of all of them and of our country. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=20.36s)]
*  You have provided great salvation for the nation of Israel. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=29.8s)]
*  I and the Cabinet members met today with the families of the abductees, those whom we [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  already succeeded in bringing back home, and those that we're doing everything we can to [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=39.88s)]
*  bring home. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=43.82s)]
*  I heard heart-wrenching stories about the thirst, the hunger, about physical and mental [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=45.32s)]
*  torture about children who are still fearful of the darkness in which their beloved ones [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=53.4s)]
*  are in. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=60.04s)]
*  I heard, and you also heard, about sexual torture, unbelievable rapes and torture. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=61.2s)]
*  I have to tell you, until a few days ago, I didn't hear the civil rights organizations, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=74.76s)]
*  nor people in the UN, organizations from there, I didn't hear their outcry. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=87.4s)]
*  And I'm telling you, where are you? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=94.0s)]
*  You were quiet because you're talking about Jewish women? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=97.12s)]
*  I have to say this in a language that everyone understands. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=102.28s)]
*  OK, so we seem to have lost the translator a bit there. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=121.28s)]
*  We're going to try to reconnect here, Brett. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=124.28s)]
*  This is obviously the Prime Minister weighing in very heavily on what he has heard about [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=127.44s)]
*  the atrocities being committed towards Israeli women. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=132.72s)]
*  Deep anguish and fear of the families who have people still in Gaza. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=136.72s)]
*  I understand the inseparable pain. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=144.72s)]
*  We are doing everything we possibly can to bring them home. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=149.72s)]
*  This is one of the three main goals we have, and the goals we have in this. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=155.92s)]
*  They each serve each other. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=162.92s)]
*  We have a huge intelligence unit, a huge one, that deals with this around the clock to bring [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=165.51999999999998s)]
*  all our abductees home safely. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=174.51999999999998s)]
*  And I'm seeing all of them. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=177.84s)]
*  This is soldiers, men and women, young and old, all of them without any exception. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=179.76s)]
*  And in every decision, returning the abductees is before our eyes. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=185.76s)]
*  And we are on the right path. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=191.76s)]
*  I saw today, Emilia Loni, who is six years old, going back to kindergarten. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=194.76s)]
*  The kindergarten teacher is embracing her. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=202.76s)]
*  Her girlfriends embrace her. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=204.76s)]
*  For one moment, in these dark days, the heart gets filled with joy. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=206.79999999999998s)]
*  And it doesn't happen often. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=213.79999999999998s)]
*  And we were able to bring 110 abductees back, thanks to an unbelievable land warfare. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=215.79999999999998s)]
*  That's the only way to bring the abductees back, the rest of them. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  We have to do this. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=233.79999999999998s)]
*  Hamas is trying to tear us apart. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  We are tearing Hamas apart. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=239.79999999999998s)]
*  Many of the terrorists came from the brigade Sajiya, the Sajiriya commander we've killed [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=241.79999999999998s)]
*  now, who was in charge of the October 7 and other murderous acts. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=252.79999999999998s)]
*  So far, about half of the commanders of Hamas we've killed. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=258.8s)]
*  And I'm telling you now, anyone who murdered, was involved, raped, or burned alive, burned [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=264.84000000000003s)]
*  our people, we will not forgive. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  We will continue our war. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=276.84000000000003s)]
*  We're continuing the land action in the north as well as south of Gaza. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  We have acted there in tremendous force. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=286.84000000000003s)]
*  The earth shook in Chanyounos, in Jebaliah. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=289.88s)]
*  Both of them we've caused damage. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=294.88s)]
*  There's no place in which we have not reached. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=297.88s)]
*  Our courageous soldiers are fighting in hand-to-hand battles, killing terrorists around the clock. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=302.88s)]
*  And in every battle, in each case of combat, we are succeeding. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=312.88s)]
*  And we'll continue until we have absolute victory. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=318.92s)]
*  It shows this, it epitomizes the strength and humility of our people. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=321.92s)]
*  But for all of this we have a price, a very price that's unbearable, which tears our heart. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=328.92s)]
*  Zusman fell in a fight in Gaza. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=336.92s)]
*  He was a hero in Israel, a great athlete, a fighter, unbelievable fighter. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=341.96000000000004s)]
*  Additionally, four other from high school, also from his school, also. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=351.96000000000004s)]
*  And Nachman also was able to combat, fight against seven. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=361.96000000000004s)]
*  Also Ariel Reich, commander of armor, Shachar Zitman, and Deir Barazani. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=368.0s)]
*  He also, like the last two from paratroopers, I'm telling them to their family of Ben, Ariel, Shachar and Deir. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=378.0s)]
*  I'm telling to their dear families of all those heroes of ours who fell. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=385.0s)]
*  They did not die in vain. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=392.0s)]
*  We will fight together, we will win, we will destroy Hamas. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=395.04s)]
*  We'll fight until victory, until we reach all our goals. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=400.04s)]
*  Return of all our enemies, destroying Hamas, an assurance that Gaza will never again constitute a threat to Israel. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=405.04s)]
*  There'll be no element there who supports terrorism, teaches it, or finances terrorism. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=414.04s)]
*  And one more thing about the day after Hamas, Gaza has to be demilitarized. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=423.08000000000004s)]
*  And for it to be demilitarized, there's only one power that can do this, demilitarization, and that's the IDF. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=430.08000000000004s)]
*  No international force can be responsible for this. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=439.08000000000004s)]
*  We've seen it happen in other places where they brought international forces for demilitarization. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=443.08000000000004s)]
*  I am not willing to close my eyes and to accept any other arrangement. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=449.12s)]
*  I repeat to the organization, to the civilian population of Gaza to move out of the combat zones. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=454.12s)]
*  And I'd also tell our friends in the world who are pressuring for a quick end of the war, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=462.12s)]
*  the only way to end this war and to end it quickly is to have a great force to destroy Hamas. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=467.12s)]
*  If our friends want us to shorten the war, which is their war too, against the barbarism that is going to flood the world, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=478.16s)]
*  they simply have to be strongly at our side. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=486.16s)]
*  I tell them in English in every language. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=490.16s)]
*  The citizens of Israel, in many of my visits out in the battlefield, I meet our heroes, our soldiers, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=493.20000000000005s)]
*  the security forces, one of them is named Ariel in armor, spoke with me from the top of the tank, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=505.20000000000005s)]
*  his tank in Gaza and other tanks in the field, religious and secular people from the left and right politically, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=514.24s)]
*  they're all fighting together. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=526.24s)]
*  They all have the spirit, the spirit of unity, of comradeship, of victory. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=528.24s)]
*  At the beginning of Hanukkah, we will again remember the heroes of the Maccabees [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=536.28s)]
*  and remember too the Maccabees, the Maccabees of our days, our heroic Maccabees of today. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=542.28s)]
*  Together we will win. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=549.28s)]
*  We will be victorious. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=551.28s)]
*  Hey everyone, I'm Emily Campagno. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOANA-BCwTQ&t=553.28s)]
