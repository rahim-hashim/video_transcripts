# Jewish Americans reportedly buying guns at record pace
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtDtoDYWB9c)
*  Firearm purchases by Jewish and Israeli Americans appear to be soaring in Southern California. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtDtoDYWB9c&t=0.0s)]
*  They are turning to guns for protection in the face of exploding anti-Semitism. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtDtoDYWB9c&t=6.0s)]
*  One California shop reports processing 203 firearm safety certificate tests last month alone. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtDtoDYWB9c&t=12.0s)]
*  That is up by more than 450 percent compared to last October, and that suggests we are seeing more first-time gun owners. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtDtoDYWB9c&t=20.0s)]
*  Eric Fletcher is the manager of that shop, Burbank Ammo and Guns. Thank you for talking to us. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtDtoDYWB9c&t=28.0s)]
*  The uptick is real, but so is a threat against Jews in this country and Jewish Americans who feel the need to protect themselves, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtDtoDYWB9c&t=34.0s)]
*  unlike the poor defenseless Israelis who were not armed at the time on October 7th. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtDtoDYWB9c&t=42.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, absolutely. As we had seen all over the internet, these individuals just walking into people's homes [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtDtoDYWB9c&t=48.0s)]
*  are kind of unchallenged with their rifles, and people don't want to see that here in America especially. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtDtoDYWB9c&t=57.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, tell me about the type of people that are coming into your shop. Are they telling you why they're purchasing the gun? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtDtoDYWB9c&t=64.0s)]
*  Are they going in there a bit, you know, feeling defeated, that they have no other choice, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtDtoDYWB9c&t=70.0s)]
*  that they feel they have no other option to protect themselves than to go and arm up themselves? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtDtoDYWB9c&t=76.0s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely, and not just in their homes, but in their places of business as well, or even just in the general public. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtDtoDYWB9c&t=81.0s)]
*  You know, no one wants to be feeling like they're helpless, especially not in their own home, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtDtoDYWB9c&t=89.0s)]
*  especially not in their offices or where they go every day. People want to feel safe. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtDtoDYWB9c&t=95.0s)]
*  And so we see many, many individuals from the Jewish community who are first-time buyers, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtDtoDYWB9c&t=99.0s)]
*  and not just the men, but women as well, mothers as well especially. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtDtoDYWB9c&t=105.0s)]
*  They want to know what they can do and what they are allowed to do to defend themselves. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtDtoDYWB9c&t=110.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, California doesn't make it easy for us, but we try to guide them through all the red tape in front of us as best as possible. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtDtoDYWB9c&t=115.0s)]
*  Yeah. Let's talk about the state of California and how it does put up a lot of roadblocks for people who want to defend themselves. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtDtoDYWB9c&t=123.0s)]
*  What would you like to say now, when we are living in a different day and time, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtDtoDYWB9c&t=131.0s)]
*  we've never seen anti-Semitism run rampant on the streets of America like we are today? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtDtoDYWB9c&t=135.0s)]
*  Laws need to change. California needs to understand that Jewish Americans have every right to protect themselves, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtDtoDYWB9c&t=140.0s)]
*  and their elected officials should back them up. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtDtoDYWB9c&t=146.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's been said a number of times, elections have consequences, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtDtoDYWB9c&t=149.0s)]
*  and now we're seeing those consequences happen on the individual level. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtDtoDYWB9c&t=154.0s)]
*  So it's important not only on big elections, but to watch who your local politicians are as well. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtDtoDYWB9c&t=159.0s)]
*  I myself have started up a little chapter here, and we're going to be very focusing on who the local politicians are. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtDtoDYWB9c&t=165.0s)]
*  There's one in our area who, he was the one that wrote the bill for the 11% tax on just firearms and ammunition [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtDtoDYWB9c&t=175.0s)]
*  that we as consumers will ultimately bear the burden of. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtDtoDYWB9c&t=183.0s)]
*  Yeah, not fair. Eric Fletcher, I hope you can help make a difference. We appreciate you coming on. Thank you. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtDtoDYWB9c&t=187.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtDtoDYWB9c&t=193.0s)]
