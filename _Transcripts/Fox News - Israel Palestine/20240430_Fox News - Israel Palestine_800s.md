# Jesse Watters: The red lines are being blown out
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s)
*  Witness testimony back underway in former President Trump's New York criminal trial [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=0.0s)]
*  on the stand right now, the executive director of archives at C-SPAN. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=6.2s)]
*  We're also learning that the court's decision on Trump's gag order violations, the judge [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=10.96s)]
*  actually threatening, listen to this, to throw him in jail. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=16.1s)]
*  We'll have a live report this hour. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=20.72s)]
*  But first we're waiting to see what happens next at Columbia University. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=22.88s)]
*  anti-Israel agitators now occupy a building on Columbia's campus that happened last night. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=27.44s)]
*  The mob actually took over Hamilton Hall. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=32.96s)]
*  It was around 1 a.m. smashing glass, barricading doors and raising the Palestinian flag, even [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  keeping a few workers there at the university barricaded for a short time. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=44.52s)]
*  As well as a banner, they had this that read Intifada. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=49.8s)]
*  That occupation still going on as we speak and we're getting new reaction from the Biden administration. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=53.36s)]
*  Hello everyone, this is Outnumbered. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=59.08s)]
*  I'm Kaylee McEnany here with my co-hosts, Harris Faulkner and Emily Campagno. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=60.32s)]
*  Also joining us, host of the Kennedy Saves the World podcast, Kennedy and host of Jesse Waters, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=64.84s)]
*  primetime, we are so excited to have him, co-host of the five and author of Get It Together, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=70.64s)]
*  number one New York Times bestseller, Jesse Waters. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=75.84s)]
*  But first let's go to Brian Yennis. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=79.28s)]
*  He's live at Columbia University with more. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=80.88s)]
*  Brian. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=82.83999999999999s)]
*  Well, good afternoon, everyone. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=83.83999999999999s)]
*  Look, this is just happened in the last 10 minutes. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=86.47999999999999s)]
*  We saw four protesters at Hamilton Hall. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=89.19999999999999s)]
*  This is the building that has been occupied now for going on 12 hours. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=92.08s)]
*  They unfurled a brand new banner and it says Glory to the Martyrs. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=95.19999999999999s)]
*  And that is right next to the other banner that's been here since we got here at four [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=99.52s)]
*  o'clock in the morning. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=103.19999999999999s)]
*  It says Free Palestine. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=104.19999999999999s)]
*  That is Hamilton Hall. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=106.08s)]
*  That is home to undergraduate admissions. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=107.08s)]
*  Columbia College Office of the Dean. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=110.64s)]
*  And that is the building that has been occupied reportedly by dozens of these student protesters [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=112.84s)]
*  since about 1230 this morning. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=118.28s)]
*  Now just a few moments ago, someone representing those student protesters, presumably a student [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=120.2s)]
*  protester herself, came out and spoke to some of the media. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  And this is what she had to say. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=129.6s)]
*  Listen. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=130.84s)]
*  That would be up to the individual discretion of students. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=131.84s)]
*  Nobody's being forced to remain. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=135.4s)]
*  Nobody's being forced to protest. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=136.4s)]
*  The students are here because of their own personal heartfelt commitment to the Palestinian [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=137.92s)]
*  cause and to the wish of divestment. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=142.32s)]
*  That being said, it would again be incredibly short-sighted of the university to expel a [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=145.88s)]
*  huge number of its students, especially considering how much consensus this matter has on campus. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=150.04s)]
*  I strongly believe that it would galvanize the rest of the campus community to help their [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=155.64s)]
*  peers as well. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=159.92s)]
*  So remember, all of this happened after the 2 p.m. deadline expired yesterday and Columbia [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=162.92s)]
*  University began suspending students. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=166.52s)]
*  There you have one of those spokespeople for the student protesters saying if you expel [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=168.44s)]
*  us, it's going to make things even worse. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=173.36s)]
*  They did say they are open to continue negotiations about their three main things they want, which [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=176.16000000000003s)]
*  is divestment from Israeli companies, transparency about those companies, and ultimately they [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=180.68s)]
*  want universal amnesty so that they're not punished for doing what they've done over [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=185.52s)]
*  the last 12 hours of barricading themselves in the building and continuing the encampment. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=189.08s)]
*  I want to show you over here, that is a blue tent. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=192.84s)]
*  It is now limited access into the main campus of Columbia University during final exam time. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=195.48s)]
*  Only those who are essential personnel and students who live on campus are allowed in [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=201.42s)]
*  right now. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=206.88s)]
*  We have seen students being denied and we spoke to one of those students who was denied [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=207.88s)]
*  entry earlier today. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=211.17999999999998s)]
*  Listen. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=212.67999999999998s)]
*  Do you want to see the NYPD come in here? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=213.67999999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=217.07999999999998s)]
*  In fact, that was one of the most disruptive elements of the past few weeks. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  You know, I've been very concerned to see the amount of guns and armaments around the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  campus and I'm not happy with the presence of the NYPD. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=224.48s)]
*  I think anytime you have NYPD, it's not... [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=227.28s)]
*  Even though you can't eat food and you're trying to study, you don't want the NYPD to [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=229.78s)]
*  come in here and break up. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=232.68s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=233.84s)]
*  Hey, look, I'm developing these types of answers to these types of questions over breakfast. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=234.84s)]
*  So chat with me later today. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=239.68s)]
*  I'll tell you how I feel. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=241.28s)]
*  Yeah, the NYPD just wrapped up a separate press conference, guys, and said, frankly, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=244.28s)]
*  they're just waiting for the Columbia University. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=248.28s)]
*  They will only go in if Columbia University gets the green light. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  We have not heard from the university about what specifically they're going to do next. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=253.7s)]
*  The only thing they've sent out is that campus alert telling everybody that there is now [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=258.74s)]
*  limited access to the main campus of this university during a pivotal time, finals, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=262.53999999999996s)]
*  finals for these students, guys. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=267.86s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=270.09999999999997s)]
*  Glory to the martyrs. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=271.09999999999997s)]
*  Recall these so-called martyrs put babies in ovens. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=272.09999999999997s)]
*  Never forget that. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=274.38s)]
*  Brian Yannis, unbelievable. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=275.38s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=276.86s)]
*  You know, I want to focus on the White House response to this and I want to talk a little [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=278.53999999999996s)]
*  bit about cause and effect. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=281.21999999999997s)]
*  And what I surmise is in fact a cause and effect. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=283.06s)]
*  Let's listen to the former president talk about this in the White House response. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=285.5s)]
*  Listen. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=289.26s)]
*  The Biden protests that are going on are horrible. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=290.26s)]
*  It's all caused by him because he doesn't have a speak. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=294.78000000000003s)]
*  He can't put two sentences together. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=297.3s)]
*  He's got to get out and make a statement because the colleges are being overrun in this country. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=299.42s)]
*  So there's Trump saying Biden should put out a statement. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=306.74s)]
*  And then it was minutes later that we don't get a statement from the commander in chief. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=309.94s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=313.58s)]
*  We get a statement from the deputy press secretary, Andrew Bates, Jesse, saying this. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=314.58s)]
*  President Biden has stood against repugnant anti-Semitic smears, violent rhetoric his [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=318.62s)]
*  entire life. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=322.42s)]
*  He condemns the use of Intifada as he has the other tragic and dangerous hate speech [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=323.42s)]
*  displays. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=327.74s)]
*  He goes on to condemn the takeover of buildings. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=328.74s)]
*  So former president asks current president response. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=331.46s)]
*  So, yeah, he when he was frolicking in the woods on Earth Day with AOC, he was asked [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=336.5s)]
*  about this action and he said, well, I have a program to deal with it. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=341.06s)]
*  Do you know what the program is? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=346.3s)]
*  Have you ever heard of the anti-Semitism Joe Biden program? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=347.58s)]
*  I've never heard of it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=351.78s)]
*  It's news to me. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=353.02s)]
*  And you look at what's happening. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=354.66s)]
*  And I say this as a father of four with affection. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=356.7s)]
*  Criminals and children have a lot in common. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=360.02s)]
*  If you run a household with no bedtime, they can eat whatever they want. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=362.46s)]
*  They can talk back to you however you want. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=366.46s)]
*  It's going to be a bad day, day after day after day. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=368.53999999999996s)]
*  If every threat's an empty threat. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=371.73999999999995s)]
*  Same thing with criminals. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=374.14s)]
*  You can't say you can steal just under $900. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=375.14s)]
*  You can walk out of jail with no bail, do whatever you want. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=377.26s)]
*  If you're an illegal shh, we won't tell ICE. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=380.46s)]
*  That's what happened at Columbia yesterday. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=383.26s)]
*  They had a deadline. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=385.38s)]
*  The red line was two o'clock. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=386.82s)]
*  What happened after two o'clock? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=389.09999999999997s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=391.09999999999997s)]
*  So what they've done now is they've seized a building. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=392.74s)]
*  And it would have been much easier to disrupt the little caliphate on the Quad because you [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=395.46000000000004s)]
*  can't go into a building and lay siege to it. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=401.58000000000004s)]
*  They have running water. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=404.62s)]
*  They have a bathroom. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=405.62s)]
*  They know the entrance and the exit points. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=406.82000000000005s)]
*  And it's going to get much trickier. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=409.54s)]
*  And a lot of the faculty love it because they cut their teeth in the Vietnam era. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=411.78000000000003s)]
*  But that was a peace movement. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=416.20000000000005s)]
*  That was about make love, not war. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=418.1s)]
*  This is about make war. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=421.54s)]
*  And so you got to just buckle down, say no, say get it together. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=424.1s)]
*  And you can't just let these red lines get blown out. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=430.06s)]
*  So Columbia, you're exactly right, didn't enforce the red line. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=433.90000000000003s)]
*  University of Florida, very proud of their response. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=437.38s)]
*  Listen to this, Harris. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=439.94s)]
*  This is not complicated. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=441.14000000000004s)]
*  The University of Florida is not a daycare. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=443.14000000000004s)]
*  We do not treat protesters like children. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=445.70000000000005s)]
*  They knew the rules. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=447.78000000000003s)]
*  They broke the rules. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=448.78000000000003s)]
*  And to face the consequences today, individuals who refused to comply were arrested after [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=449.78s)]
*  multiple warnings. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=454.94s)]
*  That's how you handle this. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=456.58s)]
*  Well, look, even Yale University got it together. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=457.58s)]
*  I mean, last hour we had Molly Lyne and the encampments gone. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=460.02s)]
*  There were some people outside the police tape now. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=463.34s)]
*  And even that crowd, she said, dissipated a short time ago. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=465.9s)]
*  It went on for days there and now it's gone because consequences. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=468.41999999999996s)]
*  They said that they would arrest. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=472.29999999999995s)]
*  They did. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=473.94s)]
*  They said that they would suspend. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=474.94s)]
*  And rather than face the consequences, most of them just simply walked away. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=476.02s)]
*  We saw a few people in twist ties. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=481.09999999999997s)]
*  So it's interesting. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=483.74s)]
*  And Jesse, you were asking about that program that the president said that he wanted to [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=485.09999999999997s)]
*  set up. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=488.18s)]
*  These are his words. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=489.18s)]
*  It would be for those people who misunderstand what's happening with the Palestinians. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=490.18s)]
*  He created a whole new group of people. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=494.34s)]
*  The misunderstood and misunderstanding, the Jew-hating, flag-carrying, whatever, screaming [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=495.96s)]
*  Israel go to hell and then the pro-Israel group. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=503.54s)]
*  So he's created a whole new bastion of people to stand outside. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=506.18s)]
*  And my big question is, how many of these people are being paid to be there? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=510.06s)]
*  When they left the encampment yesterday, far after two o'clock, they missed that deadline [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=514.44s)]
*  by a mile, but they didn't take the tents with them. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=518.24s)]
*  So who's setting up the tents? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=521.38s)]
*  Who's taking down the tents? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=523.0600000000001s)]
*  And they're nice tents. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=524.54s)]
*  I've had people tell me some of them are the best that some of the best sportsman's places [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=525.54s)]
*  can sell. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=528.8000000000001s)]
*  With like inside they got places where you can put your stuff and I mean it's like a [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=530.0200000000001s)]
*  little apartment in there. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=533.8000000000001s)]
*  They meant to stay for a while. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=535.2s)]
*  Who's paying for all this stuff? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=536.6400000000001s)]
*  I want to know this because if it's going to pop up everywhere, it's going to pop up [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=537.86s)]
*  everywhere. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=541.7600000000001s)]
*  It won't just be the campuses. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=542.7600000000001s)]
*  To that end, you know, we don't have this soundbite from John Kirby. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=544.44s)]
*  We were trying to get it, Emily, but John Kirby, I'll paraphrase him here, was essentially [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=547.2600000000001s)]
*  asking for evidence of if there are outside agitators saying that he had not seen any. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=551.6400000000001s)]
*  Well, I want to give some evidence to Mr. Kirby aggregated from various states and governors [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=555.8199999999999s)]
*  and elected officials, including right here at the mayor of New York. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=560.76s)]
*  Let's provide this evidence, Mr. Kirby. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=563.3s)]
*  Glenn Youngkin talked about non-student participants. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=565.26s)]
*  Mayor Eric Adams talked about outside agitators. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=569.26s)]
*  Northeastern University says they were infiltrated by professional organizers with no affiliation. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=572.86s)]
*  University of Texas, significant participation by outside groups. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=579.52s)]
*  University of Florida, outside agitators. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=582.98s)]
*  We have all of that evidence for our viewers, so let's scroll that as Emily speaks. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=585.04s)]
*  Right, of course. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=588.28s)]
*  The only people who don't see that this is being organized by outside agitators are the [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=589.64s)]
*  president and his infinite myopic existence and the mainstream media who just apologizes [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=594.56s)]
*  for these pro-Hamas, Hamas sympathizers. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=600.42s)]
*  Look, the reason why no one's doing anything is, number one, there's no, absolutely no [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=603.48s)]
*  teeth behind the attempts at deterrence, if that's what you even call them, but also [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=608.26s)]
*  because precedence was already set. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=611.4s)]
*  We saw it back in Seattle when, if you all recall, protesters occupied a police precinct. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=613.42s)]
*  And after 11 days of occupying the East Precinct of Seattle Police Department, what happened? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=620.3399999999999s)]
*  The cops went in and emptied out their guns and emptied out their lockers, effectively [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=625.56s)]
*  surrendering. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=630.2199999999999s)]
*  And 23 days later, Seattle Police Department got their precinct back from the protesters, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=631.9399999999999s)]
*  I'm sure many of whom were outside agitators, organized and funded by people like Soros [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=638.42s)]
*  and people who refused to show their face and name. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=644.42s)]
*  The point, however, remains that after that debacle, of course, the police chief resigned, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=646.76s)]
*  everyone in leadership resigned. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=650.5799999999999s)]
*  It was a toxic display of an absolute abdication of duty and responsibility. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=651.9s)]
*  But the bottom line is these children here, these Hamas sympathizers here, the people [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=656.2399999999999s)]
*  who pay 70 grand for an education or who pay nothing and just waltz on in and agitate [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=660.3s)]
*  They have an example, a case study to follow where the Democrats in leadership, the libs [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=666.02s)]
*  who are afraid of them all do nothing. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=671.4s)]
*  And so therefore they'll probably occupy Columbia forever. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=674.14s)]
*  Kennedy, you know, if I would have been standing at the White House podium and what you're [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=676.86s)]
*  looking at would have gone on in President Trump's watch, it would have been an untenable [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=680.0s)]
*  position for me to say I condemn anti-Semitism, but can't speak to anything beyond that. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=683.22s)]
*  Let's listen to Kareem Jean-Pierre and what the press let her get away with. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=688.1s)]
*  Play it. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=690.66s)]
*  I can't speak to him catching any of what's happening on TV. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=692.26s)]
*  I can't speak to what's going on on the ground. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=696.62s)]
*  I know what UT, what happened is just happening now, happening today. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=698.66s)]
*  So I have no idea on how that's being dealt on the ground. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=703.1s)]
*  We're not, we, I mean, we've been very consistent here about not commenting on personnel matters. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=709.02s)]
*  That's something for Columbia University, obviously the board to speak to and the president, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=714.1s)]
*  right, to make that decision. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=718.02s)]
*  So we condemn, but no follow through. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=720.06s)]
*  I can't speak to that, Kayleigh. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=721.94s)]
*  I really appreciate you asking the question. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=723.5s)]
*  The president has been very clear about this and I can't speak to his clarity. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=725.6600000000001s)]
*  He doesn't have a plan and there are echoes of 1968 all over the place, including the [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=730.0600000000001s)]
*  fact that the Democrat National Convention is going to be in Chicago this year like it [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=734.7800000000001s)]
*  was in 1968. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=739.2600000000001s)]
*  To Jesse's point, there was a point to the protests in the Vietnam War. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=741.7800000000001s)]
*  They wanted to end the Vietnam War. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=745.8000000000001s)]
*  They were very clear about their achievable objectives. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=748.22s)]
*  There are no objectives here. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=751.66s)]
*  They don't know what words like Zionism and divestment even mean, especially the Columbia [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=753.38s)]
*  students. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=758.6999999999999s)]
*  You know, they have obviously lowered the bar so much for whoever they will let in there [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=759.6999999999999s)]
*  and the ones who are on the outside are controlling the protests. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=763.3399999999999s)]
*  A lot of them aren't Columbia students. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=766.42s)]
*  They are outside well-funded agitators. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=768.42s)]
*  And how did Richard Nixon win in 1968? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=771.74s)]
*  He had a very similar message to what Donald Trump is portraying now. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=774.86s)]
*  So we are going to see more glaring similarities between now and the summer and it's going [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=779.1s)]
*  to get worse and not better because we don't have actual leadership that's willing to stand [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=784.26s)]
*  up. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=788.98s)]
*  Not only in the White House, but in these campuses, especially at Columbia, where they [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=789.98s)]
*  are refusing to follow through on their word. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=792.94s)]
*  Fantastic historical reference. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=796.0600000000001s)]
*  You could speak to that. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=797.14s)]
*  Well done, Kennedy. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=798.14s)]
*  I love it. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHUHWSPN-s&t=799.14s)]
