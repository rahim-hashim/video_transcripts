# Israel destroys Hamas tunnels, kills weapons maker
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8)
*  Battering Gaza with drone strikes and troops on the ground the IDF saying it destroyed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=0.0s)]
*  130 Hamas tunnels and killed the terror group's top weapons maker [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=5.2s)]
*  We're also learning that Israeli forces are conducting a raid in the West Bank that is ongoing [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=8.8s)]
*  Trey Yanks southern Israel for the latest on all of this now Trey [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=14.32s)]
*  Yeah, hey bill good morning [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=20.28s)]
*  I do want to start with that breaking news out of the West Bank city of Janine where today the Israelis launched a large-scale [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=21.6s)]
*  raid into the refugee camp at the heart of this city [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=27.72s)]
*  The purpose of this raid was to destroy militant cells inside the West Bank city [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=31.32s)]
*  But we also understand according to the Israelis [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  They conducted a rare drone strike against a cell of militants just outside of the city limits here along the southern front Israeli [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=38.44s)]
*  Forces continue to push deeper into the Gaza Strip [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=46.0s)]
*  I do want to just step out of the frame here and show you what the border looks like as the Sun just set [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=48.78s)]
*  Israeli infantry troops on both sides of the Gaza Strip continuing to destroy and [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=53.98s)]
*  operate in certain areas [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=59.14s)]
*  We saw today a number of explosions along the border as the Israelis targeted the tunnel network of Hamas [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=60.9s)]
*  We also know that they are facilitating the evacuation of thousands of Palestinian civilians from Gaza City [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=66.53999999999999s)]
*  And they're also going after Hamas leadership overnight [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=72.58s)]
*  They say they eliminated the head of Hamas as anti-tank missile array at the Ibrahim Abu Maghishi [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=75.7s)]
*  And this was used in a variety of attacks these anti-tank guided missiles are not only targeting the communities along the Israel Gaza border [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=81.38s)]
*  But now the soldiers that are operating inside the Gaza Strip [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=89.53999999999999s)]
*  The Israelis are expected to continue their operations trying to push deeper into Gaza City [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=92.78s)]
*  Ultimately trying to get to the Al-Shifa hospital that is said according to the Israelis to be the headquarters for Hamas Bill [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=97.66s)]
*  Trey Yanks, thank you southern Israel more headlines from there as we get them Trey [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=104.58s)]
*  Thanks, it's almost nightfall as you can see from the images there [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=108.5s)]
*  I'm going to show you in the map it was around six o'clock last evening East Coast time [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=110.97999999999999s)]
*  Where the news hit that we hit some sort of shed or equipment area or storage facility on the eastern edge [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=114.82s)]
*  Of Syria out here in the desert the reason we did that is [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=120.41999999999999s)]
*  Because of the continued strikes on our bases in eastern Syria and all throughout Iraq, okay [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=123.86s)]
*  Here's the attack on the forces back on the 19th of October not too long ago, right? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=129.54s)]
*  Two and a half three weeks a couple here a couple there you can watch on the map here the number of red dots [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=133.74s)]
*  We'll show you how these attacks have increased in their and their number and then as of I guess it was late yesterday [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=139.14000000000001s)]
*  There are at least 42 attacks on our military bases throughout this region. No fatalities reported [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=147.38s)]
*  There are injuries that have been reported. However, and that was the reason why [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=154.54000000000002s)]
*  This response happened you can ask yourself whether or not it's enough. Does Iran listen to this? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=159.26000000000002s)]
*  it's ripe for debate as well another thing I want to update you on here because [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=163.74s)]
*  As you look at the region here [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=169.22s)]
*  Remember the amount of control and influence that Iran has on so many aspects of the Middle East we talk about the West Bank [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=171.02s)]
*  We talk about Lebanon and Hezbollah. We talk about Hamas and Gaza. We don't talk a lot about Yemen here [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=177.66s)]
*  Now the Houthi rebels are backed by Iran [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=182.66000000000003s)]
*  They've been fighting an ongoing war with the government in Yemen and the Saudis have been fighting back against them [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=185.58s)]
*  You got all that well over the past two weeks the Houthi rebels [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=190.86s)]
*  According to military intelligence have been firing rockets long-range rockets trying to reach Israel [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=195.74s)]
*  Many of these rockets have been knocked out of the sky [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=201.82000000000002s)]
*  By the United States Navy and the Red Sea right along this waterway here and some others have been taken out by the Saudi [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=204.34s)]
*  Arabian government very interesting developments [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=211.02s)]
*  All right [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=213.48000000000002s)]
*  So as you examine this now and you think about Yemen and what they did yesterday, this is called a Reaper drone [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=213.78000000000003s)]
*  It's a it's an awesome piece of military equipment and surveillance equipment. It can be armed [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=220.38000000000002s)]
*  It flies at about 25,000 feet [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=226.34s)]
*  Yesterday the Houthi rebels claimed that they knocked one of our drones out of the sky [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=228.94s)]
*  In fact, they released this video and you can show it up here [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=234.18s)]
*  Jimmy just up to the left there the Houthi military media [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=237.42000000000002s)]
*  put out this image now of [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=242.26000000000002s)]
*  What they claim is their rocket hitting our [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=245.54000000000002s)]
*  Reaper drone [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=249.64000000000001s)]
*  So you have to ask yourself after they hit in Syria because of Iran whether or not this escalates also [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=251.68s)]
*  So keep an eye on it. Those Reaper drones are expensive [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=257.18s)]
*  32 million dollars each and they are very good pieces of military equipment for [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOzOY-R8dQ8&t=260.76s)]
