# Harris Faulkner: This is becoming a serious campaign problem for Biden
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [March 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg)
*  Ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas are at a standstill. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=0.0s)]
*  Now Israel is setting its sights on the last Hamas stronghold in Gaza, the southern city [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=4.4s)]
*  of Rafa. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=10.26s)]
*  It is crowded with Palestinian refugees, and Israel's planned offensive is raising tensions [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=11.540000000000001s)]
*  between President Biden and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=16.36s)]
*  Would invasion of Rafa, which you have urged him not to do, would that be a red line? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=22.62s)]
*  It is a red line, but I'm never going to leave Israel. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=28.16s)]
*  The defense of Israel is still critical. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=30.88s)]
*  So there's no red line. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  He's hurting Israel more than helping Israel by making the rest of the worldâ€”it's contrary [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=34.72s)]
*  to what Israel stands for. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=40.2s)]
*  And I think it's a big mistake. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=42.12s)]
*  I'm telling you that we're not getting off the gas. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=43.44s)]
*  I'm telling you that we have to take care of Israel's security and our future, and that [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=45.92s)]
*  requires eliminating the terrorist army. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=49.8s)]
*  That's a prerequisite for victory. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=52.4s)]
*  That victory is important not only for us. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=54.56s)]
*  But for the people of Israel. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=57.08s)]
*  And I'm a supporter for the civilized world. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=58.08s)]
*  Okay, I don't know if you caught that from President Biden. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=59.08s)]
*  He was asked, is there a red line? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=61.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=63.36s)]
*  And then he said no. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=64.36s)]
*  Obviously, that's a clue, because this is becoming a serious campaign problem for Biden. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  Far-left Democrats have pushed people to vote uncommitted in several primary states now, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=71.56s)]
*  and it worked. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  Tens of thousands of them have voted that way. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  And Senator Bernie Sanders is urging his progressive supporters to ease up on Biden. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=80.4s)]
*  Can you, in good conscience, ask your supporters to vote for Mr. Biden? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=87.0s)]
*  If you believe in democracy and involving people in the process rather than keeping [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=92.68s)]
*  people from voting, you have to vote for Biden. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=98.56s)]
*  So you're saying progressives need to put this aside? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=100.8s)]
*  The fight continues to change Biden's policy in Gaza, but the contrast between Biden and [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  Trump is day and night. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=111.68s)]
*  Did you see what he just did with half the country? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=114.52s)]
*  So apparently, if you don't believe in voting for Biden, you don't believe in democracy. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  Well, who would he be talking about? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=121.32s)]
*  Not just people in his own party, but anybody who doesn't vote for Biden. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=123.47999999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=127.11999999999999s)]
*  And New York Post op-ed argues it all comes down to politics, clearly, and Biden is trying [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=128.12s)]
*  to win re-election. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=132.88s)]
*  In Focus Now, Fox News correspondent Benjamin Hall, author of the book Saved, a war reporter's [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=134.3s)]
*  mission to make it home. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=140.0s)]
*  But now, on paperback, because I saw you on Instagram over the weekend with that and [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=141.68s)]
*  your children, welcome. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=145.6s)]
*  So talk to me about what's happening on this first day of Ramadan for the Muslim communities [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=147.72s)]
*  around the world and what's happening in Gaza with Israel and Hamas war. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  Well, you know, Harris, a few weeks ago, Benjamin Netanyahu said that the deadline for Hamas [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=158.4s)]
*  to reach a deal was the beginning of Ramadan. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=163.76000000000002s)]
*  And if the hostages weren't released and they were going to go ahead and they were going [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=166.32s)]
*  which is where he says a quarter of all Hamas fighters still are. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=169.92s)]
*  So that negotiation has fallen apart. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=173.76s)]
*  There will be no current negotiation. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=176.64s)]
*  And so what we may well be seeing over the coming days is some movement into Ra'afah. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=178.72s)]
*  In the Arab world, we are going to see quite an uprising as you do during Ramadan. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  A lot of people coming out to the West Bank and Jerusalem. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=186.6s)]
*  So there may also be a lot of riots, perhaps, on the streets of Israel and Jerusalem as [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=189.42s)]
*  well. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=193.95999999999998s)]
*  So it'll be a tricky few days ahead. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=194.95999999999998s)]
*  And when you say tricky, how does that compare with what we normally see? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=196.12s)]
*  I mean, this is this has come after months and months of Hamas leaders saying that they [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=200.84s)]
*  want to do October 7th all over again. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=207.24s)]
*  Would they hit that nation state of Israel again? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=209.84s)]
*  Oh, I mean, I think if you listen to what Hamas said, that's absolutely what they would [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=214.12s)]
*  do during Ramadan. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=218.04000000000002s)]
*  I think if they will hit it whenever they can. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  Look, they know right now that they have a quarter of their people safe. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=222.56s)]
*  And they know that if Israel goes into Ra'afah, then the Western world, they think, will turn [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=226.88000000000002s)]
*  ever further against Israel. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=233.44s)]
*  So they are in a sense that they're goading Israel. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=235.04000000000002s)]
*  They're not going to release the hostages. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=238.20000000000002s)]
*  The hostages are all they've got. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  And they are playing with the civilian lives of people in Gaza, because Hamas doesn't mind [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=241.0s)]
*  if the people of Gaza die. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=245.82000000000002s)]
*  They've proven that. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=247.08s)]
*  They're human shields to Hamas. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=248.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=249.56s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=250.56s)]
*  I want to talk to you about your book, Saved. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=252.04s)]
*  It's the number one New York Times bestseller and tells the story of your survival, Benjamin, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=253.04s)]
*  after being hit by Russian bombs while covering the war in Ukraine. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=257.88s)]
*  It happened two years ago on this Thursday. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=261.6s)]
*  And you also recount that story in a special on Fox Nation. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=264.76s)]
*  And we want to show everybody a clip of that. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=268.7s)]
*  Just as we approached the first barrier, the first shell landed out of nowhere. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=272.48s)]
*  30 yards in front of us, big explosion. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=281.4s)]
*  Immediately, Pierre shouts very quickly, reverse, reverse, get backwards. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=286.76s)]
*  The Ukrainians who were driving couldn't get into reverse. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=291.2s)]
*  And then out of nowhere, the second one lands. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=296.15999999999997s)]
*  The special Sacrifice and Survival, a story from the front line, is available right now [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=301.0s)]
*  on Fox Nation. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=306.03999999999996s)]
*  You were just telling me, first of all, have you gone back? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=307.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I was back in Ukraine in November, interviewed Zelensky. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=311.2s)]
*  And more than anything, I wanted to go back because I wanted to show, and it's what I [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=315.64s)]
*  want to talk about this week. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=318.84s)]
*  I wanted to show that you can throw everything you want to journalism. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=319.84s)]
*  You can try to stop us. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=323.06s)]
*  And Pierre, my cameraman, Sasha, our producer, they died that day. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=324.96s)]
*  But it won't stop journalism. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=328.32s)]
*  It won't stop us going back. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=330.08s)]
*  And I was back in November to show that, to show we will keep reporting because there's [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=331.96s)]
*  no way you can silence us. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=335.4s)]
*  And so we've got to remember the lives of Pierre and Sasha, everyone who's caught up [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=336.88s)]
*  in the war. But we will not stop reporting. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=340.08s)]
*  Anywhere in the world and to protect those of you who go into the front lines. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=343.08s)]
*  You know, it's it's very important that Americans understand that oftentimes you're [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=348.92s)]
*  embedded with our U.S. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=352.76s)]
*  military where we're on the ground, not in this particular case, but we're. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=353.96s)]
*  And so the danger arises no matter where you are trying to bring home those stories of [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=357.28s)]
*  truth. That's true. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=361.44s)]
*  But if you want to get the stories of truth, you have to be on the ground. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=362.84s)]
*  You have to look people in the eyes. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=365.52s)]
*  You have to figure out what's happening. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=366.92s)]
*  So many different sides of the story. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=368.32s)]
*  And now more than ever, it's important that we listen to the journalists who are out [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=369.71999999999997s)]
*  there at the moment. Amazing people. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=373.32s)]
*  We have Fox doing that right now. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=374.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, we've lost some journalists lives in the Israel Hamas war. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=376.48s)]
*  And I just want to get your last quick thought on what's happening there. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=381.04s)]
*  In the war. Yeah. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=385.96s)]
*  And journalists having to tell that story. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=387.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, I think it's tragic right now. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=388.8s)]
*  I think that we are at a point where many people are forgetting the hostages who are [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoVzN1CjqBg&t=390.28s)]
