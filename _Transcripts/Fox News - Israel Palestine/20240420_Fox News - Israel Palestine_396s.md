# World is on fire, and the US is ‘woefully unprepared’: US Air Force lt. general
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU)
*  You know, it is probably safe to say that a retired lieutenant general, David Deptula, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=0.0s)]
*  is not much into talking politics or dramas being played out on Capitol Hill. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  He is into life and death issues. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=9.96s)]
*  He is into sort of the things that are at stake right now, including aid for Israel [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=11.76s)]
*  and Ukraine and Taiwan that hangs in the balance of all of these politics. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=16.64s)]
*  Try as I might to get him to talk politics. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=20.8s)]
*  He never does. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=22.64s)]
*  So I give up on that. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=23.64s)]
*  So, General, it's always good having you, and thank you very much. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=24.64s)]
*  You wrote a very eloquent piece on this, where you just said this is what's important and [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=27.16s)]
*  this is why it's important, this aid to these countries. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=31.16s)]
*  But as you could see the way it's playing out on Capitol Hill, not everyone agrees with [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  you. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=37.28s)]
*  Why is it so important? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=38.28s)]
*  Well, Neil, first of all, I think it's important to recognize that Israel and Ukraine are both [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=39.28s)]
*  engaged in fights that are directly tied to core U.S. interests. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=47.8s)]
*  And frankly, we need to do all we can to see that they prevail in these wars, because if [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=54.199999999999996s)]
*  we don't, that will embolden our adversaries and will dramatically increase the odds that [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=59.72s)]
*  America's sons and daughters will ultimately have to spill their blood. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=66.08s)]
*  There comes a point where evil must be checked. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=70.8s)]
*  And my concern is that, unfortunately, too many Americans don't understand that, nor [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=74.6s)]
*  is there awareness that our military has been in decline while our adversaries are growing [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=81.84s)]
*  in power. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  And, you know, I don't think folks recognize, here's a good example, our U.S. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  Air Force today is the smallest, the oldest, and the least ready in its history. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=94.64s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=100.12s)]
*  The B-52, the backbone of the free world's bomber force, just celebrated its 72nd anniversary [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=101.72s)]
*  of its first flight. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=109.36s)]
*  And while not as geriatric, similar challenges can be found in nearly every service. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=111.60000000000001s)]
*  So the world's on fire, Neil, and the United States is woefully unprepared, and that demands [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=116.04s)]
*  a conversation during this election year. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=122.48s)]
*  Well, you're getting that conversation to your point, General, but it might not be going [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=126.16s)]
*  the way you like. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=129.72s)]
*  It's certainly among a lot of Republicans who are open to aid for Israel, not so much [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=130.72s)]
*  to Ukraine. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=135.88s)]
*  What do you think of that? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=136.88s)]
*  Well, I think it's extraordinarily short-sighted. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=138.92s)]
*  And the degree of ignorance, and I don't mean that in a pejorative sense. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  I mean it in the context of an absence of knowledge of what has gone on before, is appalling, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=146.51999999999998s)]
*  not just in Congress, but in our major universities and among their faculty. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=154.79999999999998s)]
*  Now, the United States has faced these decision windows before, and it's done the right thing. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  The leaders of past eras stood on the side of right, and today's leaders need to do [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=167.12s)]
*  the same thing. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=172.04s)]
*  But they're not. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=173.84s)]
*  And I'm not saying all of them. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=174.84s)]
*  The fact of the matter is these protests that have been popping up all over the country [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=176.92000000000002s)]
*  at some of our most elite institutions, General, they call into question whether Israel is [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=180.28s)]
*  worth that sacrifice, worth that cost, that it comes at a tremendous sacrifice financially [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=186.04000000000002s)]
*  and morally, they say to us. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=193.72s)]
*  Some are even waving pro-Hamas signs as they walk in the shadow. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=196.12s)]
*  It used to be the World Trade Center. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=199.32s)]
*  How do you feel about that? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=200.96s)]
*  Well, as we've discussed before, these protests are not accidental, nor spontaneous. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=203.84s)]
*  They're part of a concerted set of information operations crafted by our adversaries to create [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=211.76s)]
*  friction and discontent inside the United States. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=218.16s)]
*  Look, Iran, Russia, and China have huge malign information efforts designed to capitalize [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=221.84s)]
*  on our freedoms of speech, while at the same time they control and suppress what's allowed [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=230.32s)]
*  to be heard and said inside their own countries. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=235.2s)]
*  Now, these U.S. university students and faculty participating in these extreme protests, frankly, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=238.12s)]
*  displaying gross ignorance of how they're being manipulated. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=248.96s)]
*  In some cases, these protests are inciting violence and the perpetrators should be arrested [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=253.16s)]
*  and convicted as terrorists. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=258.12s)]
*  I would remind you and our audience that the First Amendment does not protect speech that [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=260.72s)]
*  incites imminent violence or lawlessness, which some of the protesters have been engaging [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=265.72s)]
*  in. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=271.56s)]
*  General, I want to go back to the war in Israel. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=272.56s)]
*  General, I want to get your thoughts on what has gotten to be a sort of assessment, always [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=274.88s)]
*  dangerous when that's accepted at face value, where Israel's response was tactical, precise, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=279.12s)]
*  surgical, sent a message to Iran. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=286.96s)]
*  Iran doesn't look like it will respond. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=288.68s)]
*  So these two have eased their tensions. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=291.4s)]
*  There's not going to be any more dust-ups. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=293.48s)]
*  There might be down the road with proxies, as there has been for what have been many, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=294.68s)]
*  many years, but that the worst is over. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=298.76s)]
*  That's a consensus building between those two countries. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=301.2s)]
*  I'm not talking about Israel's ongoing war with Hamas. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=304.52s)]
*  What do you think of that? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=307.35999999999996s)]
*  Well, Neil, I think the Israeli action this past week was a pretty well-crafted response. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=309.35999999999996s)]
*  If we view it through a lens of deterrence, Israel successfully demonstrated its ability [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=315.32s)]
*  to defeat Iran's mass aerial assault, and that's an element of deterrence all on its [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=321.32s)]
*  own. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=326.56s)]
*  Then the limited strike the Israelis executed in response was calibrated to demonstrate [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=327.56s)]
*  their ability to strike inside Iran, while at the same time preserving their relationship [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=333.28000000000003s)]
*  with Saudi Arabia and others who seek to provide a counterweight to Iran without open conflict. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=338.36s)]
*  And what this course of action also did was preserve Israel's relationship with the United [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=345.44s)]
*  States, who urged restraint, and prevented a flare-up of Hezbollah on the northern border [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=350.16s)]
*  of Israel. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=355.86s)]
*  So, Israel satisfied the demands for response to Iran's attack without opening a new campaign [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=356.86s)]
*  in an already complex conflict with Iran's proxy. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=363.86s)]
*  So I think the bottom line is Israel's stronger today and Iran's weaker, but don't think [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=367.5s)]
*  by any measure that this is the end of Iran's long war against Israel and the United States. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=372.46000000000004s)]
*  General Deptula, thank you very much and for your service to this country as well. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=379.38s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=382.74s)]
*  Have a great day. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=383.74s)]
*  All right, General Deptula. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=384.74s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzdwuwd_trU&t=386.02s)]
