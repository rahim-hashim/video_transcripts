# I can't even recognize Joe Biden anymore: Sen. Kennedy
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [May 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg)
*  Vandalism, trespassing, breaking windows, shutting down campuses, forcing the cancellation [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=0.0s)]
*  of classes and graduations, none of this is a peaceful protest. Threatening people, intimidating [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=6.3s)]
*  people, instilling fear in people is not a peaceful protest. It's against the law. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=12.98s)]
*  Dissent is essential to democracy, but dissent must never lead to disorder or to denying [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  the rights of others so students can finish the semester and their college education. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=24.08s)]
*  So this is what's been breaking news this hour. We showed you live the president wanted [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=30.04s)]
*  you to see his comments again moments ago because if there could have been a reporter [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=33.879999999999995s)]
*  follow up, it would have been about, well, what about the hate speech and people not [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=38.26s)]
*  feeling safe? Are you going to tell the campuses to do more, particularly the private campuses [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=42.16s)]
*  that have the ability to expel and basically end people's careers? If any of them are [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=47.68s)]
*  here illegally, they lose their foreign visas. None of that could even be asked about because [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=52.84s)]
*  he walked out the door. Now, this was the first time we had heard from the president [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=57.24s)]
*  on this issue in nine days. That silence has many people asking, where is Biden? Yesterday, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=61.96000000000001s)]
*  Republican senators tore into the administration. Watch. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=70.44s)]
*  These little Gazas are disgusting cesspools of anti-Semitic hate, full of pro-Hamas sympathizers, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=74.64s)]
*  fanatics and freaks. The universities need to put an end to this now. If they don't, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=81.08s)]
*  they should kiss their federal funding goodbye. Jewish students are being told it's not safe [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=88.62s)]
*  for you to be there anymore. I can't imagine any other group on campus that university [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=93.88s)]
*  officials would say it's no longer safe for you to be here. President Biden is scared [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=98.24s)]
*  to death to alienate the Hamas wing of the Democratic Party. You should call it for what [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=104.08s)]
*  it is. Rule by mob. Rule by mob. A belief in diversity, equity, inclusion and the right [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=111.0s)]
*  to kill Jews. And it's wrong. Republican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=122.76s)]
*  is with me now. Why is President Biden afraid to do the right thing? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=129.58s)]
*  Well, Harris, the mayhem you see is an effort to put pressure on President Biden, and it's [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=136.20000000000002s)]
*  working. What we're seeing happening on our college campuses is an X-ray of the Democratic [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=143.0s)]
*  Party as it exists at the moment. You have college presidents who are Democrats at war [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=150.68s)]
*  with faculty members, and students who are also Democrats, but they're special kind of [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=156.84s)]
*  As I said, they're members of the Hamas wing of the Democratic Party, and they believe in diversity, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=163.32s)]
*  equity, inclusion and the right to kill Jews. They want to change Middle Eastern policy for [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=170.12s)]
*  the United States. They want America to turn its back on Israel and the Jewish people and [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=178.36s)]
*  support Iran and the Hamas. Now, they can't get Congress to go along with that. They can't get [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=186.20000000000002s)]
*  the courts to go along with that, so they have to get Biden to do it. And President Biden, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=192.28s)]
*  with respect, he is old. He is weak. We'll all get there someday. I mean, I'm sorry, but it takes [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=197.88s)]
*  longer than medical school for him to walk across the stage, and he's polling right up there with [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=205.64s)]
*  robocalls. He's weak politically. He knows he has to have the Hamas wing of the Democratic Party [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=211.64s)]
*  to be reelected. He's scared, as my dad used to say. He's nervous as a pregnant nun. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=219.56s)]
*  And what they're doing to him is working. The president started out as a full-throated [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=225.8s)]
*  supporter of Israel. Now, oh my gosh, you don't recognize him. He wants to leave Hamas in charge [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=231.32s)]
*  of RAFA in southern Gaza. He's told the Israelis they have to get a new prime minister because [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=240.52s)]
*  the current one's too tough. He wants to bring in the Palestine Liberation Authority to [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=247.48s)]
*  take over Gaza. The PLA hates Jews. They want to destroy Israel. I mean, the whole thing is, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=254.2s)]
*  it ought to trigger the gag reflex of every American. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=262.68s)]
*  Well, you know, we've been talking a lot about gag orders. It's almost like he's under one, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=266.44s)]
*  because what you're talking about is happening, but he's not telling us that it is, and not having [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=271.0s)]
*  to be held to account for what's going on. Real quickly, with this president, what needs to happen [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=276.2s)]
*  next, or do you think it's cost him so much politically that he can't get that young vote now? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=282.59999999999997s)]
*  I think the president of the United States for a change needs to do what is moral and what is right. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=289.48s)]
*  And in his heart, he knows we need to stand with Israel and the Jewish people. We need to [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=298.44s)]
*  fight with everything we have against Hamas and Iran. We need to do to Hamas what we did to ISIS [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=305.8s)]
*  and al-Qaeda. And I hope, I've said it before, the president needs to go to Amazon and buy [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=314.28000000000003s)]
*  spine online and do the right thing. Are you suggesting we go to war with Israel against Hamas? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=320.76s)]
*  No, I'm suggesting that we back Israel. Just like the president started out, he gets weaker by the [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=327.0s)]
*  day. We need to back Israel. We need to destroy Hamas, just like we did ISIS and al-Qaeda. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=334.52s)]
*  And we need to realize who's behind all this, Iran. I understand the president's got political [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=341.32s)]
*  problems. I'm sorry for that, but he made them. And just because the Democratic Party has been [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=346.76s)]
*  taken over by people who hate Israel and love Hamas, that's no reason for him to go on with. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=355.15999999999997s)]
*  Senator John Kennedy, of the great state of Louisiana, no one puts it quite like you. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=363.08s)]
*  I appreciate your time, your expertise at this hour. And as a nation, we are perched to see what [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=367.4s)]
*  this president can and will do. Thank you. Thank you. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wYStH_Ourg&t=372.04s)]
