# Israel, Hamas inch closer to hostage agreement
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0)
*  And on that note now, Israel and Hamas are edging closer to a hostage agreement. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=0.0s)]
*  That's what we're being told now, but again, we've been told that for days. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=5.96s)]
*  The U.S. cutter in Egypt brokering these talks that would pause the fighting in exchange [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=9.28s)]
*  for the release of nearly 300 hostages. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=14.0s)]
*  The founder of the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, Omar Lubatan Granat. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=17.6s)]
*  Sir, thank you for your time. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  I hope I did well with your name, but I appreciate you being here today. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=23.88s)]
*  You know, it's been on my mind all weekend. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=28.18s)]
*  One of the things I find disturbing. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=31.9s)]
*  Thank you Bill, thank you for having me. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=33.06s)]
*  You bet. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=34.7s)]
*  Is that Hamas has not given many images of proof of life. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=35.9s)]
*  And as the IDF moves through northern Gaza and soon this war is going to develop in the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=42.019999999999996s)]
*  southern part of Gaza. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=46.06s)]
*  What can you tell us about your level of confidence that negotiations could be successful? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=49.46s)]
*  I think it's very hard to tell because I think that Hamas is irrational player. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=56.68s)]
*  So I think that any leverage or any pressure that Israel or the U.S. can bring and do on [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=61.76s)]
*  Hamas with mediators or with diplomatic means or military means. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=69.32s)]
*  I think that they use everything they can because each day path, the chance that we [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=74.56s)]
*  will see our loved ones back home alive safe and sound is decreasing and we see what's [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=81.16s)]
*  going on. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=85.86s)]
*  We see what's going on with Noah that you just mentioned and his living care in the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=86.86s)]
*  U.S. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=90.6s)]
*  It's such a sad story. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=91.6s)]
*  Yeah, there's no doubt about it. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=93.08s)]
*  I mean, it's not just Israelis there, but there are Americans being held in Gaza too. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=95.08s)]
*  The president was asked about it on Sunday. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=99.72s)]
*  Just give this a listen here. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  Mr. President, when will more hostages get out? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=105.32s)]
*  When will more hostages get out? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=109.82s)]
*  So what he said was, I'm not in a position to tell you that. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=116.52s)]
*  I'll make sure they're out and then I'll tell you. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=118.96s)]
*  And that might be the best posture publicly right now. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=121.16s)]
*  But this is the proposal. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=124.2s)]
*  Hamas would release maybe 20 women and children. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=126.16s)]
*  Israel would release 20 women and children from an Israeli jail. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=130.2s)]
*  There would be a pause in fighting. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=134.28s)]
*  Hamas wants up to five days. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=135.96s)]
*  I don't know if that's going to fly. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=137.24s)]
*  What do you think would be a, it's really hard. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=139.78s)]
*  What would be a sound agreement where both sides could even trust each other on those [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=143.96s)]
*  conditions? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=148.58s)]
*  I think, of course, you know, after all what's going on, there is no trust between the sides. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=149.58s)]
*  But for me, you know, the side I represent, my family, the hostages' families, we want [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=156.58s)]
*  any deal that will keep our families safe and bring them home. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=163.78s)]
*  But we also understand, you know, we also have families that are now in the forefront [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=167.10000000000002s)]
*  of the battles. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=170.9s)]
*  My brother is there in the south. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=172.4s)]
*  So you know, we care deeply about our soldiers, the danger, the life for us. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=174.32s)]
*  We care deeply about the citizens that live next to the borders. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=177.98s)]
*  So we want to believe that we can find a deal. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=181.38s)]
*  I'm not an expert in those kind of deals. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=183.76s)]
*  I'm not, you know, I'm not, I don't know all the details that I believe the IDF and our [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=185.56s)]
*  government knows. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=191.92s)]
*  But I want to believe that we can reach a deal when we can bring them home and keep [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=193.48s)]
*  our other interests, you know, alive and in the forefront. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=198.04s)]
*  Omar, we're going to stay in touch with you and many others. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=202.34s)]
*  We're not going to let the issue go. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=205.06s)]
*  I know you've had many family and friends. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=206.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=208.78s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=209.78s)]
*  We need your support there. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=210.78s)]
*  I know you do. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=211.78s)]
*  We need your support. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=212.78s)]
*  The Americans people, we need the support of the American government. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=213.78s)]
*  I want to thank you for having me. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=216.73999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you bet. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=217.98s)]
*  I know you suffer greatly too with all your families and friends in southern Israel. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=218.98s)]
*  So hang tough and we'll hope for the best. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=223.89999999999998s)]
*  Thank you, sir, for your time. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=226.12s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=227.78s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNOBugV_t0&t=228.78s)]
