# This is a 'black eye' for the United Nations: Lt. Gen. Nicholson
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [February 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY)
*  And joining us for more on this is retired U.S. Marine Corps Lieutenant General Larry [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=0.0s)]
*  Nicholson. He served in Iraq and Afghanistan and also had experience in Gaza as a UN military [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=3.74s)]
*  observer. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=8.6s)]
*  I want to talk about this hostage rescue for just a moment. Yesterday, Biden and Netanyahu, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=9.6s)]
*  or maybe over the weekend, Biden and Netanyahu had a call. And Biden was basically saying, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=14.6s)]
*  don't go into Rafa. And then Israel rescued two hostages that were being held in Rafa. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=20.14s)]
*  So should the Biden administration take a step back here? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=28.16s)]
*  You know, Dan, I think first of all, thank goodness for the rescue of those two hostages [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=33.28s)]
*  down in Rafa. I think what the administration is trying to press to Israel is to do what [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=37.6s)]
*  Israel has always done best and the more exquisite, the more focused sort of operations as opposed [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=42.3s)]
*  to, you know, dropping apartment buildings. And I think that's where the administration's [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  But to ask them to stay out of Rafa completely makes no sense. I mean, we have some indications [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=55.68s)]
*  that's where probably a lot of the hostages are. And certainly we're uncovering a lot [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=60.24s)]
*  of the understanding of how Hamas would operate. And sort of this is kind of the end of the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=64.52s)]
*  Gaza Strip, the southernmost, right, with Egypt. So I think you've got to get in there. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=72.6s)]
*  You got to look around. But I think the administration is asking them to be a little more deliberate [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=77.68s)]
*  and to be a little more, you know, sort of exquisite with their intel directed operations. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=84.24s)]
*  Yeah, General, the reporting suggests that women and children on the Palestinian side [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=89.36s)]
*  were also killed during this raid. And you don't know all the particulars inside those [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=95.2s)]
*  buildings or what sort of warning they had or how the IDF moved in. Here's how the Wall [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=99.32s)]
*  Street Journal characterizes it. OK, Hamas was right under UNRWA's nose. The United Nations [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=104.16s)]
*  Agency looked the other way, keeping Gaza safe for Hamas. It continues. Does the UN [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=110.4s)]
*  expect the world to believe that a sophisticated engineering operation was begun by Hamas only [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=116.28s)]
*  in the past few months amid Israeli bombardment after UNRWA had moved? The day after the Gaza [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=122.78s)]
*  War would be a brighter one if UNRWA and Hamas exit the stage together. Just on that last [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=128.6s)]
*  point, General, what Netanyahu is saying to his own people and the world. And really, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=134.16s)]
*  here's the question. And throughout the whole Middle East region, what he is saying is that [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=140.08s)]
*  Hamas is the equivalent of Al Qaeda and we cannot live next to Al Qaeda. We must wipe [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=144.4s)]
*  them out. The Biden administration may want this conflict to wrap up very soon, but Netanyahu, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=151.28s)]
*  based on his interview with Shannon yesterday, is absolutely convinced that Israel is going [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=158.56s)]
*  to take the entire operation out before it ends. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=163.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Bill, I tell you, incredibly troubling. And as a former UN guy, very discouraging [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=167.72s)]
*  to understand that, you know, perhaps UNRWA has been complicit. And it's hard to imagine [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=173.4s)]
*  based on the evidence that's being presented. Hard to imagine that they were not somehow, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=179.24s)]
*  you know, working with Hamas. Now, we've got to understand there's 30,000 members of UNRWA, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=185.28s)]
*  but I think somebody's got some explaining to do how that construction can occur under [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=192.4s)]
*  the headquarters of the United States, of the United Nations Relief Workers Agency, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=198.70000000000002s)]
*  how that can happen. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=206.12s)]
*  Don't forget too, Bill, 22 percent of the entire United Nations budget is provided by [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=207.12s)]
*  the United States. And so I think certainly a lot needs to be explained, but this is a [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=212.28s)]
*  really troubling development and frankly a black eye for the United Nations. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=220.0s)]
*  General Nicholson, thank you. We appreciate your time this morning. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=224.4s)]
*  Okay. Thank you, Dan. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=227.4s)]
*  Thank you, Sarah. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K8AD4IO0tY&t=228.92s)]
