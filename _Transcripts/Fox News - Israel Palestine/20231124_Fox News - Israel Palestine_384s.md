# Thai hostages released alongside 13 Israelis
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc)
*  Alex Hogan is live at the Schneider Children's Medical Center. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=0.0s)]
*  That is near Tel Aviv. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  This is where the women, the children released [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=4.92s)]
*  who have spent more than 40 days now in captivity [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=7.84s)]
*  in somewhat unknown conditions. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=11.28s)]
*  We can imagine, of course, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  and some government officials have referred [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  to underground dungeons, for instance. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=16.68s)]
*  So very tough circumstances. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=18.76s)]
*  Hostages have certainly suffered. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=20.6s)]
*  And they're headed in your direction [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  and to see those doctors, their facility. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=24.28s)]
*  What do you know right now, Alex? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=27.32s)]
*  Hi, Molly. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=30.72s)]
*  So yes, this is the Schneider Children's Facility [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=31.56s)]
*  where we know at least some of these children [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=33.56s)]
*  will be brought. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=36.04s)]
*  They'll have their own separate wings. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=36.88s)]
*  So they'll be away from other patients. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=37.92s)]
*  They'll have a little bit more privacy. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  And that was where they will finally reunite [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=41.84s)]
*  with their families, their loved ones. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=44.84s)]
*  Again, it's been nearly seven weeks. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=46.36s)]
*  I've talked with a lot of families in my time out here [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=48.2s)]
*  about how traumatic this has been. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  This has been a nightmare for those who are here [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=52.24s)]
*  wondering every single day what their loved ones [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  have likely been through in the last seven weeks. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=56.6s)]
*  Of course, when we're talking about what these hostages [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=59.32s)]
*  have lived through in the physical conditions [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=62.28s)]
*  that they likely are in, I talked with one expert [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=64.6s)]
*  a couple weeks ago about how living underground [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=66.68s)]
*  and just the long lasting effects that that would have [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=69.28s)]
*  of not being able to see sunlight, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=71.84s)]
*  being malnourished, having dehydration issues [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=73.2s)]
*  on top of the psychological issues. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=76.72s)]
*  So all of these children will have access to a therapist [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=78.44s)]
*  as well as plenty of doctors in this facility behind me. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=81.12s)]
*  But right now we can take a look at this live broadcast [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=83.92s)]
*  that we're able to see. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=86.72s)]
*  Egypt says that it is preparing to receive those hostages [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  and through negotiations we're also learning now [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=91.08s)]
*  that Egypt's mediation efforts have reportedly [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=93.88s)]
*  yielded the release of an extra 12 hostages. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=96.36s)]
*  These are Thai nationals. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=99.48s)]
*  So we know in the October 7th attacks [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=101.04s)]
*  when Hamas came here to Egypt, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=104.2s)]
*  not only killing about 1200 people, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=106.32000000000001s)]
*  as on top of all of these hostages that were taken [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=108.84s)]
*  that were Israeli, a lot of foreign nationals as well, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=110.80000000000001s)]
*  there was a large percentage of Thai foreign workers [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=113.64s)]
*  who were in that part of Southern Israel [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=116.84s)]
*  working in the fields and they were a big part [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=119.64s)]
*  of the people who were taken. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=123.0s)]
*  So several weeks ago, about four or five weeks ago [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=124.36s)]
*  when I was here, we saw a lot of the hotels here [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=127.28s)]
*  in Tel Aviv completely full with Thai foreign nationals. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=129.96s)]
*  They were then able to go back to Thailand. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=133.64000000000001s)]
*  There were big charter buses that would come pick them up [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=136.8s)]
*  and take them to the airport really throughout the day, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=139.12s)]
*  throughout the night until most of them had gone home. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=141.36s)]
*  But they of course had many hostages that were taken [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=144.44s)]
*  that were Thai nationals. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=147.4s)]
*  So those Thai nationals reportedly now [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  through this new brokered negotiation [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=151.0s)]
*  are among those who have been released. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=153.32s)]
*  And we did hear from the Thai prime minister [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=155.28s)]
*  on social media saying that there's official confirmation [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=158.32s)]
*  that those Thai workers have been released from captivity. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=161.79999999999998s)]
*  We'll have to wait and see what their condition is. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  There's likely a lot of negotiations being brokered right now [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=168.0s)]
*  and there's been some conversations about how to get them [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=170.67999999999998s)]
*  back to Thailand as quickly as possible. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=172.83999999999997s)]
*  So they as well can be reunited with their family members. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=175.04s)]
*  But that is completely separate from the 13 extra people [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=177.95999999999998s)]
*  that we are likely going to see many of them, again, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=181.16s)]
*  children that will be here at this medical facility. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=184.44s)]
*  So we have been seeing people coming by honking their horns. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=186.92s)]
*  A lot of people here who are eager to see [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=190.92s)]
*  what is going to happen and give the support to the families [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=193.79999999999998s)]
*  who have been waiting for so many weeks, Molly. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=196.76s)]
*  Right now, there is also Benny Gantz, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=199.16s)]
*  who is one of the ministers here in the country, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=201.0s)]
*  who's speaking to some of the families at this same gathering [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=203.16s)]
*  that we typically see families gathering [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=206.20000000000002s)]
*  in this central square protesting, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=208.08s)]
*  calling on the government to do more. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  There is a lot of hope today [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=212.12s)]
*  that this will all come to fruition. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=213.88s)]
*  We haven't received the official word yet [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=215.52s)]
*  that these 13 people have officially crossed. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=218.68s)]
*  There was hope and expectations that among them [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=222.04000000000002s)]
*  in this group of 13, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=225.12s)]
*  there could be those three expected dual citizens, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=226.48s)]
*  US and Israeli citizens, who could be released, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=230.16s)]
*  including a four-year-old girl. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=232.56s)]
*  Today is actually her fourth birthday, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  but she reportedly is not among those 13. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=236.16s)]
*  Molly. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=240.04s)]
*  Alex, you've covered a lot of great ground for us there [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=240.88s)]
*  as we continue to watch this key crossing, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=243.4s)]
*  the Rafa crossing there. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=245.16s)]
*  We're seeing a lot of movement, a lot of people. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=246.04s)]
*  We've been watching the vehicles going in and out. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=247.64s)]
*  But as you noted, we don't know precisely [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=249.92s)]
*  where these hostages are, how they exchange, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=253.12s)]
*  how far along things are going in the process. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=257.2s)]
*  One of the things you talked about a moment ago [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=258.76s)]
*  was the mental health aspect of all of this. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=260.68s)]
*  Of course, these hostages are getting out. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=263.64s)]
*  They're going to need physical and mental help. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=265.36s)]
*  You've talked about just the capacity, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=267.04s)]
*  what it's like to be held underground. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=269.52s)]
*  They also have information that authorities may want. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=271.52s)]
*  They wanna talk to them and maybe get some idea [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=275.03999999999996s)]
*  about the other hostages that are being left behind. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=277.71999999999997s)]
*  But I suppose they need to be fairly delicate about that, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=280.36s)]
*  particularly with women and children [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=282.76s)]
*  that have suffered so much recently. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=284.08s)]
*  I think that's going to be, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=289.0s)]
*  the first focus is reuniting these families, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=290.44s)]
*  these families who've been such emotional turmoil [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=293.59999999999997s)]
*  over these weeks. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=296.12s)]
*  But after all of that is said and done, these reunions, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=297.32s)]
*  we likely won't hear any comments from the families today [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=299.8s)]
*  because of, of course, the celebration of getting to return [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=302.28s)]
*  and see your loved one once again. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=305.03999999999996s)]
*  But after that, yes, there will be an all hands-on effort [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=306.28s)]
*  to try to comb through whatever memories [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=309.56s)]
*  that these hostages can pull together about what they saw, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=312.20000000000005s)]
*  where they were, were they all together? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=315.0s)]
*  We know that these 13 people who are coming back [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=316.76000000000005s)]
*  were all from the same kibbutz, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=319.40000000000003s)]
*  the same little village, right? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=321.12s)]
*  Somewhere we're expecting it to be along the border [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=322.64000000000004s)]
*  if they were all from the same village [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=324.84000000000003s)]
*  because those were largely the villages that were attacked. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=326.24s)]
*  Now, in terms of what that means, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=330.32000000000005s)]
*  we can also potentially deduce that it was a better [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=332.32000000000005s)]
*  than hoped experience for them. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=336.84000000000003s)]
*  Maybe if these 13 people were all from the same village, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=339.71999999999997s)]
*  maybe they were together during these past seven weeks, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=342.59999999999997s)]
*  that of course would be a much better situation [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=345.36s)]
*  than had they all been separated. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=348.15999999999997s)]
*  That's not necessarily to say that that is true. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=349.64s)]
*  They could have all been separated for these seven weeks [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=351.91999999999996s)]
*  and then reunited for them to be now brought [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=354.52s)]
*  through the Rafa crossing. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=356.96s)]
*  But that will be a big question [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=358.59999999999997s)]
*  for some of these investigators today [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=360.56s)]
*  of what's likely to come. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=362.28s)]
*  Absolutely, and that's one of the hope [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=364.12s)]
*  that so many of the hostage families had in their hearts, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=365.8s)]
*  that fathers were still with their sons, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=367.92s)]
*  that mothers were still with their babies, all of that. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=369.68s)]
*  And you're absolutely right, that's one of the big questions [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=372.2s)]
*  that we all wanna find the answers to. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=374.08000000000004s)]
*  Alex Hogan, thank you so much. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=376.12s)]
*  A historic day there on the ground in Israel, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=377.76s)]
*  and we'll be coming back to you later, of course. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=381.06s)]
*  Thanks for the reporting. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-6HTB5u9qc&t=382.88s)]
