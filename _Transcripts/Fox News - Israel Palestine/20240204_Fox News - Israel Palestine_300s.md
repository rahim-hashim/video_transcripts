# John Kirby reveals Biden admin will take ‘further action’ against Iran proxies
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [February 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA)
*  Joining us now Admiral John Kirby National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications. Welcome back a deceaser [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=0.0s)]
*  Okay before the strikes even started on Friday [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=7.26s)]
*  You know there were critics who talked about the delay one week ago today [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=9.32s)]
*  Those three soldiers were lost from the Wall Street Journal editorial board [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=12.56s)]
*  Militia leaders can't say they weren't warned and if any of them were still around the target areas [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  They are the world's dumbest terrorists. Was it too much of a delay two thoughts there first [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=20.88s)]
*  It's not like we held back any notification that we were gonna respond if our troops were attacked [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=26.52s)]
*  I mean the president's been clear we will respond so it's not as if [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=31.840000000000003s)]
*  prior to the attack last weekend that the militia groups in the IRGC and [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=36.72s)]
*  Folks in Tehran didn't know that we were gonna take seriously any attack on our troops are on our facilities [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=41.36s)]
*  And then with the specific attack that that we that we struck the targets we struck on Friday night [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  I mean you want to do this in a deliberate way you want to do it you want to [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=53.28s)]
*  Carefully select your targets you want to make sure that that all the parameters are in place to have good good effects including [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=57.96s)]
*  Factoring in the weather. I mean these attacks were using manned aircraft [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=64.2s)]
*  You want to make sure your pilots can get in and get out safely [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=67.48s)]
*  So there was a lot of planning that went into that [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=69.76s)]
*  And again the Pentagon believes we had good effect that we that we hit what we were aiming at [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=72.12s)]
*  So our next guest up doesn't think that there have been tough enough strikes yet [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=76.48s)]
*  Lindsey Graham has sat on this desk and said he thinks we need strikes inside Iran that you have to get their attention with things [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=80.08s)]
*  That really matter to them like their oil infrastructure [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=86.32s)]
*  Strikes on Iran within Iran on or off the table. I'm not on a national [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=89.8s)]
*  Television show going to telegraph punches or get in front of the president and his decision-making space [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=95.24s)]
*  I'm certainly not gonna talk about potential future military operations what I would say and this is a really important point is what you saw [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  On Friday night was just the first round there will be additional response actions taken by the administration [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=106.64s)]
*  Against the IRGC and these groups that they're backing there were growing calls from some in on Capitol Hill that they need [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=112.24s)]
*  From the White House you to come to them to ask for authorization for use of military force [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=118.76s)]
*  Do you think that will come at some point with this specific set of strikes? The president is acting [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=123.26s)]
*  consistent with his Article 2 [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=129.08s)]
*  Responsibilities as commander-in-chief these are self-defense actions that we're taking to prevent and to take away [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=131.64000000000001s)]
*  Capability from these groups from targeting our troops in our facilities. It's not just Republicans [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=137.88000000000002s)]
*  So you do have senator Cardin who chairs the Intel committee? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=142.60000000000002s)]
*  He says you think you need to you guys need to come to him [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=145.84s)]
*  We're confident and comfortable that the president has the appropriate authorities to continue to conduct these strikes to protect our people our ships our sailors [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=148.36s)]
*  Our troops in our facilities throughout the region [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=155.48000000000002s)]
*  Okay, there are critics who say we're in this position because of the president's actions [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=157.88s)]
*  They point to things like easing sanctions on Iran's oil industry that allow them to rake in tens of billions of dollars [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=161.8s)]
*  We know money is fungible [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=167.0s)]
*  How can we say or with any certainty that those funds are not funding these groups that are now taking aim at our soldiers? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=168.6s)]
*  You know three lives lost dozens others injured an opinion piece in the Hill puts it this way [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=174.96s)]
*  It says any clear-eyed assessment of Biden's performance in foreign policy past and present [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=179.66s)]
*  Reveals one consistent threat which certainly helps explain the dire state of world affairs during his presidency [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=184.44s)]
*  His unusual commitment to choosing the weakest or least [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=189.8s)]
*  Confrontational path he's talked about being worried about [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=194.08s)]
*  Igniting something broader in the region [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  But is this idea of appeasement sending the wrong signal to folks there who only understand brute strength? Sure. Look I [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=198.84s)]
*  It's hard to take a look [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=205.92000000000002s)]
*  I think at what we've been doing over the last three years and say that we somehow been soft on Iran [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=207.28s)]
*  I mean more than 500 entities sanctioned 50 sanctioned regimes [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=211.2s)]
*  He has bolstered our force presence in the region including at one point having two aircraft carriers there one of the med one in the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=215.95999999999998s)]
*  In the middle in Middle East waters. In fact, there's a carrier still there [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=222.95999999999998s)]
*  And in terms of the attacks that we've suffered over recent months [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=227.11999999999998s)]
*  We he has increased the aggressiveness of our responses to go more directly after the IRGC [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=232.64s)]
*  And now you saw what happened on Friday night and I'm telling you that's not the end of it. There will be more [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=239.0s)]
*  so I think we just [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=244.0s)]
*  Obviously come come to a different place here on whether or not we've been [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=245.92s)]
*  Aggressive enough and muscular enough on Iran now [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=249.6s)]
*  You're right [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=251.66s)]
*  The president doesn't want to see a broader conflict in the Middle East and we're not looking for a war with Iran and I'll bet you [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=251.96s)]
*  The American people don't want that either [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=257.08s)]
*  We're gonna do what we have to do to hold them accountable and it's not like Shannon there had there weren't attacks in the previous [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=258.6s)]
*  administration either right after [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=264.8s)]
*  Then President Trump ordered an attack on Kasim Soleimani the head of the IRGC attacks on our troops in our facilities [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=266.56s)]
*  Spiked pretty dramatically to the point where in late 2020 the former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was actually considering [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=274.04s)]
*  Weighing the options are closing our embassy in Baghdad. So these groups have been doing this for a while [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=281.08s)]
*  Let's let's see. We got the first round out on Friday. Let's see where this goes. I'm Steve Ducey [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri1wnPt-WYA&t=285.72s)]
