# World opinion is turning against Israel 'quite strongly': Retired Lt. Gen. Kellogg
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [May 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg)
*  Now let's bring in retired Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=0.0s)]
*  Sir, thank you for being here on this Memorial Day. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=3.68s)]
*  We really appreciate it. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=6.24s)]
*  Trey Yankst brought us this rather remarkable, heartbreaking video out of Israel, out of [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=13.16s)]
*  The rockets coming yet again out of Barapha heading into Israel. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=14.16s)]
*  The Iron Dome doing its work and also this terrible video of civilians that are suffering [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=17.28s)]
*  there on the ground. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  The fires in these tents. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=23.72s)]
*  I just want to get your thoughts of this situation as we're watching it unfold. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=24.84s)]
*  Yeah, Molly, thanks for having me today. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=29.56s)]
*  Look, it's a messaging issue right now. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=32.84s)]
*  The Israelis are losing that. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=34.76s)]
*  And I know they're trying to eliminate the Hamas leadership in Ra'afah right now. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=36.56s)]
*  But this is reaching a point now where they should have gone in earlier, eliminated it [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=42.72s)]
*  and then gotten out. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=46.4s)]
*  Here's what needs to really be done. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  Is United States should intervene in the sense they need to pick up and call the Qatari government, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=49.36s)]
*  who's hosting Hamas leadership and say, look, there's a big issue right now with the hostages. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=54.0s)]
*  Tell us where the hostages are or put the International Red Cross on the ground to verify [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  that the hostages are in fact still alive. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  We've had no proof of life that they're actually still alive and the numbers there are. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=68.28s)]
*  But this is going to continue and I would advise the Israelis, they better finish this [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=72.4s)]
*  in a hurry because world opinion is turning against them quite strongly. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=76.36s)]
*  This is one of those, it's a pretty complicated problem. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=81.2s)]
*  I know they're trying to finish the job. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=84.2s)]
*  They need to get it done. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=85.76s)]
*  Which brings us great point to the next part of this conversation about the ICC, the International [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=87.2s)]
*  Criminal Court, the chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, just recently sent out arrest warrants [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=92.10000000000001s)]
*  for Benjamin Netanyahu, for Yoav Galant, the defense minister there, as well as some Hamas [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=96.76s)]
*  leaders. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=101.92s)]
*  This is what he has said. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=103.4s)]
*  He has said Israel has every right to protect its population and to get the hostages back, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=104.6s)]
*  that nobody has a license to commit war crimes or crimes against humanity. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=109.84s)]
*  But when Israel seeks some clarification as to what he means, he made this argument that [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=113.2s)]
*  in essence to look at how Britain handled things with the IRA, with the time of the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=119.48s)]
*  trouble, so to say, and drew a comparison here that Israel could act similar to Britain [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=125.16s)]
*  did in that time period. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=130.2s)]
*  What do you make of that suggestion? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=132.74s)]
*  Actually, Molly, it's apples and oranges. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=136.48s)]
*  It's two different things. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=139.95999999999998s)]
*  And I know I mentioned Karim Khanda, the chief prosecutor for the ICC. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=140.95999999999998s)]
*  He talked about Margaret Thatcher and how she handled it with the IRA. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=144.92s)]
*  It's not the same at all. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  Hamas is a terrorist organization, went into Israel, attacked Israel, killed over a thousand. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=151.23999999999998s)]
*  As a frame of reference, the United States is 30x larger than Israel. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=157.79999999999998s)]
*  That would be like Hamas killing 30,000 Americans. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=162.76s)]
*  We wouldn't tolerate that. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=167.44s)]
*  And you look at the ICC and you really don't understand the nature of war. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=168.88s)]
*  Nobody wants to get into war. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=173.06s)]
*  When you get in it, it can be pretty nasty and there will be collateral damage to civilians. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=174.06s)]
*  That's the reason why I think the Israelis need to finish it up as soon as they can. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=178.84s)]
*  By the way, on the ICC, it's one of the reasons why we're not part of the ICC, the United [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=182.2s)]
*  States isn't. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=186.76s)]
*  We signed up initially and then we said, nope, it's not going to work. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=187.76s)]
*  at all. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=191.52s)]
*  So we're not party to it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=192.52s)]
*  In fact, in 2002, we put in the Servicemen's Protection Act where we told the ICC quite [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=193.52s)]
*  clearly, if you take one of our American service members or diplomats, the president has all [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=199.20000000000002s)]
*  means, can use all means necessary to actually retrieve that individual. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=204.04000000000002s)]
*  So we put the ICC on notice when it comes to Americans. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=208.4s)]
*  Israelis have not done that. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=211.96s)]
*  I think another great point you were making was that this needs to go back to the hostages. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=212.96s)]
*  And right now, just in recent days, when you're talking about the messaging out of Israel, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=217.6s)]
*  they put forth a video reminding everyone, reminding the globe about these young women [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=222.2s)]
*  that are still being held now, well over 200 days. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=226.4s)]
*  And where are they? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=229.72s)]
*  Word about their conditions. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=230.72s)]
*  How are they doing? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=232.04s)]
*  There's so much we don't know and Israel is still literally working to get their people [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=233.04s)]
*  back. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=236.92000000000002s)]
*  I mean, that's something they say over and over again, bring them home. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  Is it working? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=241.28s)]
*  Is the international community thinking about those young people? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=242.28s)]
*  Yeah, you know, Molly, we can tell the Qatar government, Tamim, the Al Tamim family, and [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=247.64000000000001s)]
*  they were, you know, they kind of lean on us a little bit. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=253.96s)]
*  We need to lean on them. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=256.56s)]
*  We said, need to do one thing we need to do is get Hamas out of Qatar. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=257.56s)]
*  And the second is somehow pressure the International Red Cross with Hamas leadership to find out [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=261.52s)]
*  about the hostages. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=265.82s)]
*  And you're absolutely right about the women. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=266.82s)]
*  My concern is, I don't think the numbers are going to be there. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=268.42s)]
*  Originally, we thought 100, then it went down to 15. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=271.8s)]
*  Now we're at around 30. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=275.0s)]
*  I don't know if any of them are still alive. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=276.35999999999996s)]
*  And that's the hard, that's really the heartbreaking part of this. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=278.2s)]
*  Before I let you go, this is Memorial Day. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=281.35999999999996s)]
*  And you know, I have young kids, I try to impart with them a love of America and an [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=285.11999999999995s)]
*  appreciation for the sacrifices that our troops have made and people serving. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=289.44s)]
*  There's a headline. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=294.2s)]
*  Peggy Noonan writes in the Wall Street Journal, teach your children to love America. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=295.2s)]
*  She writes, quote, children are instructed in a hundred different ways through a hundred [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=298.21999999999997s)]
*  different portals that America is and always was a dark and scheming place that its history [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=301.92s)]
*  is the history of pushing people around often in an amoral quest for wealth, but also because [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=306.40000000000003s)]
*  we aren't very nice ideology and idiocy imposed this view shallowness to it began some decades [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=311.68s)]
*  ago, but has speeded up and become more extreme in the past 10 years. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=317.56s)]
*  With that sort of sentiment out there with people that don't appreciate this country, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=322.20000000000005s)]
*  how do we impart a love for America and appreciation for the people that serve to our children? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=326.20000000000005s)]
*  Well, we just need to keep reminding them about the sacrifices and today is a day of [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=332.52000000000004s)]
*  reflection and remembrance of the sacrifices of those who've given them this freedom. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=337.6s)]
*  This is not like Veterans Day. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=341.86s)]
*  This is Memorial Day and we honor those that have fallen, you know, and this is something [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=343.20000000000005s)]
*  that we need to think about. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=347.36s)]
*  You know, think about the families that sacrificed so much for the nation, about the moms who [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=348.56s)]
*  never were able to say goodbye to their sons and daughters and the fathers who maybe went [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=352.96000000000004s)]
*  into a back room and wept silently or the fathers and mothers who had to raise children [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=356.72s)]
*  on their own because their spouses were gone or the young children who were holding photographs, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=362.72s)]
*  faded photographs of those people that have gone before them, their moms and dads, sons, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=368.28000000000003s)]
*  brothers or sisters. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=372.8s)]
*  And we just need to remind them all about that. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=373.8s)]
*  Sometimes it's hard to remember that. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=376.6s)]
*  You know, I remind everybody when you play the national anthem, when you think of the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=378.56s)]
*  of the national anthem, it says, oh, say, can you see, or is it still the land of the [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=382.96s)]
*  free and the home of the brave? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=388.15999999999997s)]
*  It's a question and you have to answer that hopefully in the affirmative. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=389.84s)]
*  And then I think about today really hard and you think about that great poem, For the Fallen, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=393.79999999999995s)]
*  by Lawrence Binion, who wrote it over a hundred years ago in the middle of the First World [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=398.79999999999995s)]
*  War when he said, at the falling of the sun, remember them. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=404.12s)]
*  And you need to remember those that we lost. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=408.91999999999996s)]
*  And it's a hard thing to do sometimes. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=411.32s)]
*  And I know it comes to me pretty hard because I've lost a lot of soldiers in combat. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuCs78cA2mg&t=412.91999999999996s)]
