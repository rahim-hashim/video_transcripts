# Israel conducts deadly airstrike near Iran embassy in Damascus: report
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk)
*  Breaking news. Syrian state media are reporting Israel has conducted a rare daytime strike [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=0.0s)]
*  next to the Iranian embassy in Damascus. Reuters is citing Lebanese security sources saying [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=6.78s)]
*  that the airstrike killed a senior Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps leader, Mohammed [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  Reza Zahedi. In 2010, you should know the U.S. Treasury sanctioned Zahedi, calling him [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=20.12s)]
*  the commander of the IRGC, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Quds Force in Lebanon. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=25.88s)]
*  And he played a key role in Iran's support to Hezbollah. So much more we can learn about [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=32.44s)]
*  him. What we want to know now is did Israel hit a target that it wanted to? Trey Yanks [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=38.8s)]
*  has details. Trey, from the ground, what's happening? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, Harris. Good morning. This is an extremely significant development, according to Syrian [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  state media. Mohammed Zahedi, one of the leaders of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, a commander [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=54.559999999999995s)]
*  that was involved in the weapon shipments for Iran to groups like Hezbollah and Iran-backed [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  Syrian Shia militias, has been targeted in an Israeli airstrike this afternoon in Damascus, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=66.92s)]
*  Syria. We have seen some of the aftermath video next to the Iranian embassy in Damascus [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=73.12s)]
*  Syria, indicating a massive explosion took place. Zahedi, one of the commanders very [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=80.56s)]
*  close to Ismail Khani, the general in charge of all Iranian activity across the Middle [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=85.2s)]
*  East. Now, if this is confirmed by the Iranians, we should be very clear what took place here. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  According to reports, an Israeli airstrike took out one of the top Iranian generals in [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=97.84s)]
*  the Middle East, targeting a facility linked to the Iranian embassy in Damascus, Syria. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=103.08s)]
*  This is one of the most significant developments of the conflict so far, and it will have repercussions [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=109.12s)]
*  across the Middle East. We are waiting to hear from Iranian officials in Tehran. The [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=115.18s)]
*  Israeli military has not yet commented on the strike, and again, we are sourcing this [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=119.76s)]
*  information to Syrian state media, but the latest information that we have, Mohammed [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  Zahedi, this top Iranian general, appears to have been killed in an Israeli strike this [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=129.44s)]
*  afternoon. Harris. All right. You talk about repercussions, consequences. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=134.52s)]
*  What do you mean? What will that look like? What could it look like? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=139.08s)]
*  Israeli forces will likely be on high alert throughout the day and into this evening. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=145.72000000000003s)]
*  We should look back at recent history to see the types of responses the Iranians have conducted [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=150.5s)]
*  when their top generals have been targeted in similar strikes. We know that back in 2020 [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=156.74s)]
*  outside of Baghdad's International Airport, when the Americans killed top Iranian general [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=162.16000000000003s)]
*  Qassem Soleimani, the Iranians fired ballistic missiles toward a U.S. base in Western Iraq, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=166.88s)]
*  the Al-Assad air base. Now, we don't know if there will be a similar response to this [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=173.22s)]
*  targeted assassination today in Damascus, but it is an indication that the Israelis [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=177.57999999999998s)]
*  will have to remain on high alert, understanding that Iranian proxies in places like southern [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=183.24s)]
*  Lebanon could be further activated as they already have been throughout the conflict [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=187.84s)]
*  over the past 177 days and possibly respond to this strike. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=192.48s)]
*  So Trey, I want to get into this a little bit because you know we've been hit north [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=197.39999999999998s)]
*  of 150, 60, 70 times, our troops in the Middle East. And you talk about a move that helps [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=202.35999999999999s)]
*  the United States by taking out a commander that reloads with ammunition and does a whole [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=208.83999999999997s)]
*  lot of damage for the Quds Force of the Iran Revolutionary Guard. You talk about somebody [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=214.16s)]
*  with that kind of power. That no doubt helps our cause as well. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=219.12s)]
*  Absolutely. Mohammed Zahedi is the main individual who facilitates the weapon shipments from [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=223.52s)]
*  Tehran to places like southern Lebanon, but more importantly for American troops to places [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=233.12s)]
*  like Syria and Iraq. This is an individual who is a top brigadier general in the Iranian [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=239.44s)]
*  military echelon. He is responsible for supplying these Iran backed Iraqi and Syrian Shia militias [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=246.44s)]
*  with the rockets and weaponry that they are using to target American forces in the Middle [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=253.96s)]
*  East and the same weaponry that is being used by Iran backed Hezbollah to target Israeli [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=258.56s)]
*  forces in the northern part of this country. So it's a significant development. The targeting [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=264.44s)]
*  is really substantial and symbolic when you look at where the strike took place. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=269.88s)]
*  The Iranian embassy compound in Damascus and when you see some of this aftermath video, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=275.8s)]
*  when it pans to the left outside of the embassy, you see a portrait of Iranian general Qasem [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=280.88s)]
*  Soleimani that was taken out in that US drone strike in Baghdad back in 2020. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=286.88s)]
*  Under former President Trump and you talk about, and people do because it's an election [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=292.36s)]
*  year, you talk about comparing what Joe Biden and his administration have done in retaliation [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=296.88s)]
*  in response to all of the attacks on Americans in the last few months. And you look at something [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=302.64s)]
*  like this done by the Israelis and you look at what was done to take out Soleimani who [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=310.0s)]
*  you just so, I mean it's unbelievable, the imagery of this and how he, a picture of him [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=313.71999999999997s)]
*  sits alongside what was just taken out next to the Iranian embassy. You look at all of [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=320.71999999999997s)]
*  that and what's happened under the current president and the loss now, the drifting away [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=326.52s)]
*  of support for Israel, it is mind boggling. Trey Yankst, always fantastic reporting, appreciate [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=331.04s)]
*  it. Thank you. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpCLePkoWk&t=336.84000000000003s)]
