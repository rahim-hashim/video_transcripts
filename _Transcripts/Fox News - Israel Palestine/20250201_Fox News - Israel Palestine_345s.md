# Trump was able to do this just 12 days into his presidency, expert applauds
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [February 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A)
*  Back to another Fox News alert happening overnight American Keith Siegel freed from Gaza [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=0.0s)]
*  Along with two other hostages as part of Israel and Hamas's ceasefire deal [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=6.46s)]
*  Now the release comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to be the first [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  Foreign leader to meet with President Trump at the White House next week [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=15.9s)]
*  Ellie cohanam is served as Trump's deputy envoy to combat anti-Semitism and she joins us now [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=20.1s)]
*  I hope I did not overly butcher your name. No, you got that right [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=27.12s)]
*  So when you're looking at these, you know, obviously we're all [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=31.76s)]
*  Delighted and happy to see anyone reunited. But when you're looking at these pictures, what do you what do you think Charlie? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=36.92s)]
*  You know what we have here is a three-phase hostage deal and today we're seeing the 17th hostage release so far [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=44.040000000000006s)]
*  This is great news [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=51.88s)]
*  And for the region what this means is that President Trump has come in and within 12 days of coming into office [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=54.04s)]
*  He's managed to stabilize an escalating situation, right? We've got a ceasefire now in Gaza. You've got a ceasefire in Lebanon [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=60.68s)]
*  You've got hostages getting released and yesterday [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=68.48s)]
*  This is very little reported but the Philadelphia corridor was opened up and you've got EU forces there [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=71.1s)]
*  watching over monitoring as [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  As wounded Hamas and wounded Gaza civilians are leaving to Egypt for medical care [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=80.64s)]
*  so all of this is good progress in a very difficult delicate situation and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=87.8s)]
*  very much because of President Trump's hands-on leadership his presidential envoy Steve Witkoff is [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  Conducting shuttle diplomacy. He's gone to Gaza. He's the first American official in Gaza in 15 years [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=101.36s)]
*  He's met with the Palestinian authorities number two guy when he was in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=107.80000000000001s)]
*  He met with the Israeli hostage families and gave them a lot of hope and encouragement [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=113.32000000000001s)]
*  And so all of these are very important steps in again stabilizing a region that was on fire [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=117.72000000000001s)]
*  Just you know, just a couple of weeks ago [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. I can't I couldn't agree more with your assessment. I think it's it's perfect [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=128.68s)]
*  I think Witkoff has been doing an amazing job doing exactly what the president wanted him to do which was as you said to stabilize [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=132.54000000000002s)]
*  And hopefully bring peace to the region [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=139.54000000000002s)]
*  So what do you think are the long-term implications for what people are seeing there? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=141.58s)]
*  They're obviously in the region. Both sides are seeing strength from Donald Trump [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=145.66s)]
*  What does that mean for the prospect of peace? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=149.54000000000002s)]
*  Which we all want in the region and which America wants so they can also focus more on their domestic issues [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=152.06s)]
*  Absolutely Rachel and so look what we know from the first Trump administration is that President Trump and his team are out of the box [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=159.32s)]
*  Thinkers and so to that point we've seen President Trump say this week that he'd like Israel's Arab neighbors Egypt and Jordan in particular [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=166.8s)]
*  to take Gaza refugees and [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=174.12s)]
*  And so this is something that he has said over and again [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=176.88s)]
*  And I believe that it's something that the administration will likely work on it [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=180.32s)]
*  And look, this is the only population in the world where where there's a war situation [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=183.36s)]
*  And people are kind of having a hard time with the idea of refugees [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=188.52s)]
*  So I think this is something that we're gonna see that's out of the box [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=192.32s)]
*  But could really help lead to peace in the region where you you know diffuse the situation you take people out of a very [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=195.0s)]
*  Crisis situation we heard Steve Witkoff say it's gonna take 15 years to rebuild Gaza [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=203.58s)]
*  So that's one piece of this the other piece is Netanyahu coming to the United States this week [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=209.56s)]
*  I know that he'll certainly want to talk with President Trump about what's happening in Gaza Lebanon, but also Iran and [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=214.8s)]
*  That's also very important piece of the regional picture [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=222.48s)]
*  and I'm sure that the Iranians know their experience with President Trump and [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=225.5s)]
*  We saw him again show peace through strength in his first administration [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=231.04s)]
*  And without a doubt we're gonna see more peace through strength in this administration [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=235.96s)]
*  And [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=240.56s)]
*  Final note and I don't know if Joe if you had a question for me [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=241.76s)]
*  Final note, you know the thinking out of the box is what we saw with the Abraham Accords with President Trump which was [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=246.44s)]
*  the ability to to help bring peace to the region without allowing the Palestinian issue to [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=254.48s)]
*  Fester and so this is again what we're seeing right now [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=262.08s)]
*  Is that the president is thinking out of the box and coming up with suggestions that will actually [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=265.5s)]
*  Lead to peace in the region and not get stuck on [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=271.82s)]
*  Avenues that did not work in the past real quick kind of a yes or no short on time [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=275.7s)]
*  Is there a world where the Middle East especially with the US and Israel come out stronger on the other side of this? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=280.3s)]
*  Oh, absolutely Joey look the Israelis have done an incredible job of prosecuting this war [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=286.02000000000004s)]
*  Even with the Biden administration tying their hands behind their back and so now that you've got the Trump the Trump administration in office [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=292.18s)]
*  Pete Hegseth as our defense secretary [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=298.98s)]
*  Senator Rubio is our sex state [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=302.46000000000004s)]
*  I think this incredible team of people who understand the region and speak the language of the region [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=304.34000000000003s)]
*  They will definitely support Israel and without a doubt the United States and Israel are gonna come out stronger [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=310.70000000000005s)]
*  And I think all of our allies in the region are gonna come out stronger for this [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=317.26s)]
*  Do you see a two-state solution? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=320.22s)]
*  To state solution president Trump said on the campaign trail that he thinks act after October 7th. That's become harder. Yeah to to see through [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=323.06s)]
*  Okay, Ellie cohanam. Thank you so much for joining [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOycPuhfA1A&t=332.3s)]
