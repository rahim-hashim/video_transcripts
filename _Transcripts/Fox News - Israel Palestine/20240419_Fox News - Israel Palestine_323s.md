# Biden weighs largest transfer of weapons to Israel since Oct. 7: Report
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg)
*  Back to our top story this morning, U.S. source telling us that Israel carrying out a retaliatory [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=0.0s)]
*  strike against Iran overnight. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=5.2s)]
*  Now, we still have not heard from Tel Aviv or received an official statement from the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=6.88s)]
*  White House, but we could hear from Secretary of State Antony Blinken any moment now as [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  he prepares to step up to that podium in Italy. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=15.96s)]
*  Mark Toth is a national security and foreign policy expert. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  Colonel Jonathan Sweep served 30 years as a military intel officer. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  And both gentlemen join me now. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=26.0s)]
*  Mark, is this a one and done by Israel or is this setting the stage for further action? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=27.76s)]
*  Good morning, Todd. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=34.56s)]
*  It appears to be a one and done right now, but as your previous guest was saying, Dan [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=37.56s)]
*  Hoffman, I highly suspect that there's something more to come and we'll be finding that out [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=42.68s)]
*  in the day or the days ahead. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=48.32s)]
*  I think what we're seeing though at a higher altitude is that this is a perfect storm that's [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=50.92s)]
*  been in the making for a long time, beginning in Afghanistan with the permissive environment [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=55.42s)]
*  that President Biden started to create by his chaotic and frankly premature withdrawal [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=60.58s)]
*  from it to now what we're seeing his fear of escalation and not wanting to see things [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=67.18s)]
*  escalate, be it in Ukraine or the Middle East, is actually leading to the escalation that [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=75.42s)]
*  he so fears. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=80.7s)]
*  In Ukraine, we saw that again on October 7th and just then again this last Saturday. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=81.7s)]
*  So from that standpoint, it may be one and done for right now from Israel's standpoint, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=89.10000000000001s)]
*  but the Mideast is in a very dangerous position at this point, largely because President Biden [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=94.94s)]
*  has created this. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=100.30000000000001s)]
*  And I would add one last point here. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=101.92s)]
*  One of the things that we need to be looking at is connecting the dots. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=104.86s)]
*  This isn't happening in a vacuum. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=109.94s)]
*  It's happening because China, Russia, North Korea, as well as Iran are acting as an axis [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=112.62s)]
*  of evil. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=119.3s)]
*  And that's all coming together to put the Middle East in this dangerous situation that [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=120.66s)]
*  we're in. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=125.66s)]
*  They're operating together and it's time for the U.S. to start pushing back and saying, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=126.66s)]
*  hey, we're going to lean into winning now. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=132.14s)]
*  No more of this defending into perpetuity. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=134.28s)]
*  Earlier in the week, Joe Biden told Israel, told Benjamin Netanyahu, take the win, don't [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=136.34s)]
*  do anything. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=140.66s)]
*  Obviously Benjamin Netanyahu ignoring that. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=141.66s)]
*  But now, Jonathan, I want to draw your attention to a brand new report we literally got seconds [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=144.22s)]
*  ago out of the Wall Street Journal saying that Joe Biden is now weighing more than one [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=148.78s)]
*  billion dollars, one billion in new arms for Israel, the largest transfer to that country [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=152.76000000000002s)]
*  since October 7th, 2023. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=158.78s)]
*  What's your reaction to that, Jonathan? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=162.26000000000002s)]
*  Well, my reaction is it's about time. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=166.02s)]
*  And it's also it's about time that the folks in Congress pass the supplemental funding [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=169.78s)]
*  bill for Israel. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=175.10000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=178.10000000000002s)]
*  I understand his shot's frozen there. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=179.10000000000002s)]
*  Mark, can you pick up on that question? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=183.58s)]
*  What do you make of this new one billion dollars in new arms for Israel that I asked Colonel [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=185.26000000000002s)]
*  Jonathan about? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=189.70000000000002s)]
*  You know, it's needed for sure. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=192.14000000000001s)]
*  This late incoming, you know, Israel's fighting a war on multiple fronts right now, and they're [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=194.9s)]
*  fighting a war that has to be won in the Gaza Strip. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=201.54000000000002s)]
*  The U.S. has been doing its best, I should say Biden has been doing his best to tamp [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=204.18s)]
*  down on that, leaving Hamas intact, which is crazy, because the Gaza Strip, one way [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=208.9s)]
*  or the other, is going to have to be rebuilt, and you don't want Hamas sticking around [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=213.82s)]
*  to be the ones to do it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=217.56s)]
*  We're just going to be looking at a rinse and repeat situation. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=218.82s)]
*  So from this standpoint, Israel needs the money, the weapons and the capabilities to [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=222.22s)]
*  put an end to Hamas, as well as to be able to deter, if not destroy, if necessary, Hezbollah [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=227.1s)]
*  in Lebanon and take on Iran as needed, especially as their nuclear program and their nuclear [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=233.14s)]
*  breakout in terms of their ability to produce bombs, which they may already be there, draws [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=239.3s)]
*  near. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=245.06s)]
*  So there's a lot of things going on now, and a billion dollars frankly may just not be [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=246.06s)]
*  enough. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=249.98s)]
*  There's a big potential war happening in the Mideast that we as a country have to be [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=250.98s)]
*  leaning into to make sure that we win it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=256.08s)]
*  Jonathan, I believe we have your shot back. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=258.46s)]
*  I want to lean on your time as a military intel officer. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=260.34s)]
*  What do you expect to see on the streets of Iran today? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=264.42s)]
*  Well, I think what we're going to see on the streets of Iran today is just messaging. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=268.3s)]
*  The Iranian government is going to say that they defeated an Israeli attack and they're [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=276.86s)]
*  going to be pushing their citizens to get out in a protest and to say that they're [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=280.66s)]
*  winning. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=284.5s)]
*  So that's what we're going to see. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=285.5s)]
*  But in reality, it was a message or a strong message that was sent. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=286.5s)]
*  And Iran gets it, at least the leadership gets it. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=290.14000000000004s)]
*  But they're going to try to push that away and say that there was a victory. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=293.26000000000005s)]
*  But clearly, if you can touch the Iranian nuclear sites at will, like Israel demonstrated [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=299.46000000000004s)]
*  last night, apparently that it can. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=306.96s)]
*  I do not think that's cause for celebration if you're the mullahs there. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=309.0s)]
*  In Iran, could be cause, though, for celebration for the Iranian people if this could ultimately [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=312.68s)]
*  lead to the ouster of those mullahs. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=316.68s)]
*  Mark Toth, Colonel Jonathan Sweet, thank you for your insight. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=318.91999999999996s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJHDOTZSVg&t=321.59999999999997s)]
