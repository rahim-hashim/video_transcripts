# Israeli official: 'Hamas will now take the mother of all thumpings'
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw)
*  Meanwhile, I want to get to the Middle East because there was breaking news from overnight [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=0.0s)]
*  to folks just waking up today that week long ceasefire. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=3.2s)]
*  It's over between Israel and Hamas thick black smoke rising over Gaza. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=6.24s)]
*  The IDF resume strikes on targets inside Gaza. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=11.84s)]
*  Israeli officials blaming Hamas saying they broke the ceasefire shortly before is set [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=15.700000000000001s)]
*  to expire. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=20.2s)]
*  Nate Foy live on the ground at his post in northern Israel with the latest on the headlines [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=21.2s)]
*  from there today and Nate they're back at it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=25.32s)]
*  Hello. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=27.8s)]
*  They certainly are, Bill. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=29.8s)]
*  Good morning to you. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=31.04s)]
*  The temporary ceasefire broke down in the early morning hours today after Israel says [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=32.04s)]
*  Hamas refused to release the 20 final female hostages that it still has in Gaza. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=36.2s)]
*  And this is what we saw shortly after that. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=42.8s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  So you mentioned it, Bill. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  Israeli jets hit multiple targets in Gaza, including Hanunis in the south. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  So far Israel has hit 200 terrorist targets in Gaza today. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=56.48s)]
*  Hamas claims Israel violated the ceasefire agreement first. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=62.199999999999996s)]
*  Israel denies that and says their operation to eliminate Hamas will carry on. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=65.96s)]
*  The perpetrators of the October 7th massacre have decided to hold on to the hostages they [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=71.6s)]
*  brutally abducted in violation of humanitarian law. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  Hamas will now take the mother of all thumpings. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=80.12s)]
*  So you see the damage in Hanunis here, Bill. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=84.64s)]
*  The IDF dropped leaflets in the southern Gaza Strip instructing civilians to move to evacuation [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=88.72s)]
*  zones. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=94.88s)]
*  But you see here many did not and the damage here is severe. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=95.88s)]
*  The end of this temporary ceasefire means horrible conditions will get even worse for [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=99.8s)]
*  the Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=104.52s)]
*  Badly needed aid will have an even harder time getting in. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=106.32s)]
*  Qatar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirms negotiations will continue to resume a pause [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=109.64s)]
*  in fighting. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=114.16s)]
*  The end of this ceasefire agreement also means, Bill, that Israeli hostages will not be coming [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=115.28s)]
*  home today. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  Hamas released eight Israelis in a prisoner hostage exchange yesterday. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  Over 130 hostages remain in Gaza. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=125.19999999999999s)]
*  Now that ceasefire agreement, Bill, never technically applied to the Hezbollah terrorists [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=129.16s)]
*  that are on the northern front in Lebanon, but the past few days have been relatively [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=135.08s)]
*  quiet. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=140.56s)]
*  So now that the fighting has resumed in the south, the few people who remain in these [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=141.56s)]
*  evacuated villages up north wait to see if the fighting will come here. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=145.0s)]
*  We'll send it back to you. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=148.24s)]
*  Nate, a bit later this hour we're going to talk to the parents of an Israeli-American [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=149.76000000000002s)]
*  who has not been seen or heard from since the 7th of October. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=153.24s)]
*  Just imagine what they're experiencing today. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=156.68s)]
*  Nate, thanks back to you for more headlines from the Middle East. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcd-JOB3Pqw&t=158.60000000000002s)]
