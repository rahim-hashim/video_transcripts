# Military expert reveals the ‘only way’ Israel could take down Fordow
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14)
*  For more on the escalating Israel-Iran conflict, retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=0.0s)]
*  joins me here at the map. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=6.36s)]
*  He's a senior fellow with the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  Admiral, welcome. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=11.36s)]
*  Great to have you. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=12.76s)]
*  Mike, thanks for being here. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=13.76s)]
*  So since you're a Navy man, let's start with the U.S. Navy assets in the Middle East region. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=14.76s)]
*  A second carrier group, the Nimitz, is going into the Arabian Sea this weekend. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=18.0s)]
*  How significant is it to have two carrier groups in the region? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=23.46s)]
*  Well, the big change is going to be the Nimitz was scheduled to come. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=26.92s)]
*  The Nimitz is coming faster, and I imagine the Carl Vinson strike group here will now [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=29.64s)]
*  stay. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=33.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=34.84s)]
*  So we'll build up, and what that does is double the number of Navy fighter attack aircraft [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=35.84s)]
*  from, say, 50 to 100 that are available to conduct operations. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=38.72s)]
*  The other big Navy group's up here. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=45.16s)]
*  So these five destroyers, and there won't always be five exactly here, are positioned [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=46.16s)]
*  in the Eastern Mediterranean to provide medium-range ballistic missile defense of Israel against [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=49.08s)]
*  weapons fired from Iran, and they can do some limited work against stuff coming from the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=55.9s)]
*  Houthis down here. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=60.62s)]
*  But they have a unique capability with the SM-3 missile, so they're big players. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=61.62s)]
*  These destroyers are still remaining in the Red Sea against Houthi attacks. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=67.06s)]
*  Truxton, the four Shermans. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=71.58s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=74.5s)]
*  So let's move on. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=75.78s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=77.86s)]
*  So these are the nuclear facilities that have been attacked by the Israelis. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=78.86s)]
*  So, Fordow is the big one that everybody's concerned about right now. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=82.58s)]
*  It is not in downtown Tehran, the Iranian capital. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=86.53999999999999s)]
*  Your thoughts on the targets, and what about Fordow? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=89.94s)]
*  So, exactly right. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=93.06s)]
*  They've hit Natanz, Isfahan, and other Iraq, and other sites here, and done significant [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=94.58s)]
*  damage. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=99.9s)]
*  They've been around Fordow, but the reality is the president's right. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=100.98s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu said they could take Fordow. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=104.74s)]
*  I think a fair statement is they could do significant damage to Fordow, but the only [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=107.42s)]
*  way you're going to destroy Fordow, and it's not a guarantee, but the only possible way [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=111.42s)]
*  are B-2 stealth bombers delivering the GBU-57, that 30,000 pound weapon. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=116.38000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=121.66000000000001s)]
*  So let's continue on. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=122.66000000000001s)]
*  This is Fordow. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=124.54s)]
*  Good look at it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=125.86s)]
*  Here's the facility. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=127.02000000000001s)]
*  So you've got tunnel entrances here. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=128.02s)]
*  You got centrifuges beneath the mountain. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=129.94s)]
*  You got a support building at 18,000 square feet, a checkpoint there. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=131.94s)]
*  There's been some suggestion that Israeli commandos could do the job, but that has great [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=136.9s)]
*  risk. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=142.3s)]
*  So there is a lot of attention, obviously, on American might and the impact it could [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=143.3s)]
*  have there at Fordow. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=147.86s)]
*  Exactly right. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=149.14000000000001s)]
*  So the Israelis could do a commando attack on this. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=150.14000000000001s)]
*  I think there's risk to mission, i.e. it wouldn't be successful, but also risk to force, the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=153.26s)]
*  idea that you'd actually be able to extract those soldiers after you're completed. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=157.82s)]
*  Air Force could destroy things like the support buildings, could destroy the electrical power [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=163.38s)]
*  infrastructure for this, could hit the tunnel entrances, just make it hard. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=167.61999999999998s)]
*  But what the U.S. Air Force can do is flatten the area, you know, this cause a collapse [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=172.14s)]
*  of the facility. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=176.61999999999998s)]
*  We have some animation we can show our audience what the B-2 could do if called into act. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=178.0s)]
*  We'll see if the commander chief makes that call, but here we go. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=183.1s)]
*  So here's the GB-57 bunker buster bomb. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=186.57999999999998s)]
*  The first one would go in. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=189.39999999999998s)]
*  And then a second one would follow to go into the hole to presumably detonate and destroy [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=191.7s)]
*  the below ground facilities. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=198.66s)]
*  Your thoughts, sir? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=200.89999999999998s)]
*  Well, that's about right. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=201.89999999999998s)]
*  So that weapon that you saw there coming in has a special casings that allow it to almost [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=202.89999999999998s)]
*  drill deeper. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=206.89999999999998s)]
*  This graphic, the ones on FDD's website that Fox has been using, show that very explicitly. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=208.14s)]
*  You create a channel that a second or third weapon could go through, and then they have [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=213.51999999999998s)]
*  special fuses that go off at that depth. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=218.01999999999998s)]
*  The idea is to create an instability that causes the weight on a now unstable structure [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=220.48s)]
*  to collapse the facility down in and among itself. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=225.16s)]
*  And that would destroy the up to 3,000 centrifuges that are there that are making the weapons-grade [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=228.39999999999998s)]
*  uranium. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  Our pilots obviously train for these kind of missions. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=234.82s)]
*  Your thoughts on the risk involved with that and how likely it would be to be successful? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=237.39999999999998s)]
*  So I'll break that up and I'll say for the pilots, there's risk in every flight. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=242.28s)]
*  There's certainly risk in every flight where you fly over the adversary and you release [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=246.48s)]
*  a weapon. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=249.56s)]
*  But I would say our B-2 stealth bomber has a proven ability to get through to targets, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=250.56s)]
*  a proven ability to deliver this weapon. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=256.56s)]
*  And they're the best bomber pilots in the world. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=258.96000000000004s)]
*  Whether it will be successful or not, I'm not sure. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  I do know that if we don't drop it, that will not be taken down by an aerial attack. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=264.88s)]
*  The only thing that's going to take it down by an aerial attack is the GBU-57 delivered [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=269.48s)]
*  by the B-2 stealth bomber. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=275.24s)]
*  It's a really remarkable aircraft. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=278.44s)]
*  69 foot long, 17 feet high, 172 foot wingspan. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=279.44s)]
*  Just a massive miracle in terms of aviation, right? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=284.92s)]
*  It is and its replacement, the B-21, which we'll start seeing in just a few years here [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=289.08000000000004s)]
*  from the Air Force, we'll have that in much greater numbers. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=293.24s)]
*  There's under 20 of these now. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=296.20000000000005s)]
*  And they're an important part of our nuclear enterprise. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=298.0s)]
*  So when we commit them to an event like this, it actually has an impact on our nuclear readiness. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=299.88s)]
*  So it's good that they're able to, those six sorting from Guam, that might be what this is about. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=304.40000000000003s)]
*  That's a reasonable commitment. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=309.0s)]
*  I can imagine a future five and ten years from now where we have a lot more B-21s able [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=310.56s)]
*  to do these missions. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=314.28000000000003s)]
*  We're at it. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=315.28000000000003s)]
*  Mark Montgomery, grateful for your time, sir. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOySJFvMH14&t=316.28000000000003s)]
