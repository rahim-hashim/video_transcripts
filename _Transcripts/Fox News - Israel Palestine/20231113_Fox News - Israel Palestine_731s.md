# This has opened up 'serious fault lines in our society': Douglas Murray
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A)
*  But those who, uh, those who protest for Hamas, you're protesting for sheer evil. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=0.0s)]
*  There are a lot of misguided people out there who don't know the facts. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=5.76s)]
*  You're talking to people who deliberately targeted civilians, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=8.86s)]
*  who raped and murdered women, who raped, uh, who beheaded men who burnt babies [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=11.76s)]
*  alive, who kidnapped, uh, little babies and hostage and, uh, and Holocaust [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=17.96s)]
*  survivors, you name it. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=22.48s)]
*  These are the people that you are supporting. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=23.88s)]
*  That is Benjamin Netanyahu, who's doing a lot more interviews these days and over [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=26.56s)]
*  the weekend, uh, and he puts himself out there and the every interview ends this [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=30.36s)]
*  way. Are you going to take responsibility for what happened? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=33.72s)]
*  A lot of people think his political career is over. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=35.839999999999996s)]
*  The parliamentary system is not something we deal with, uh, but it's something that [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=38.04s)]
*  could collapse their government. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=42.2s)]
*  But right now it's all about coming together. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=43.4s)]
*  That's what I hear. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=45.0s)]
*  But what does Douglas Murray know? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=46.08s)]
*  He's in Tel Aviv right now, Fox News contributor, bestselling author, National [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  Review Institute fellow. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=51.36s)]
*  His new book is The War on the West, his latest book is The War on the West. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=53.56s)]
*  Douglas, I hear you're in traffic in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=56.56s)]
*  That would be a prime target for Hezbollah, who I understand is ratcheting up the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=59.44s)]
*  rockets. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=64.04s)]
*  Yes, that's right. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=66.32000000000001s)]
*  There's been more and more activity on the northern border in recent days, which, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=67.24000000000001s)]
*  uh, is obviously causing a lot of alarm. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=71.16s)]
*  Israel is currently fighting obviously a very intense, uh, house to house battle [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=73.92s)]
*  inside Gaza against Hamas. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=79.32000000000001s)]
*  Um, but of course, all eyes are also on the northern border where, uh, there has [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=81.84s)]
*  been, as I say, an increased activity, some, uh, anti-tank artillery, um, machine [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=87.8s)]
*  gun fire as well as rockets. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=95.2s)]
*  And of course, that's a great concern, uh, to the Israeli government and the people [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  of Israel because Hezbollah has tens of thousands of rockets stored there. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  They do. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=107.2s)]
*  Uh, but there's a sense too, I imagine you tell me that Hezbollah is only going to [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=107.92s)]
*  get stronger and this country's at war, on a war footing right now. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=113.56s)]
*  Is there a, is there any part of, is the Israel IDF that thinks to themselves, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=118.52000000000001s)]
*  should we just get this over with now? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  Uh, I'm sure there are, uh, and there's obviously a wide variety of opinion. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=126.92s)]
*  Um, I think most people are grateful that the northern front hasn't opened up, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=131.2s)]
*  um, and it's an interesting scenario because of course, Iran has a great deal [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=135.8s)]
*  to do with the funding and arming of not just Hezbollah, but Hamas as well. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=141.88s)]
*  It seems that they haven't, as it were, tried to come to Hamas's aid by making [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=147.56s)]
*  situation harder for Israel by opening the northern front, but that's sort of quite [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=153.64000000000001s)]
*  commonplace for Iran's behavior, which is that the revolutionary government, uh, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=159.32000000000002s)]
*  you know, both keeps proxies going and also sacrifices them as needs be. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=164.16s)]
*  How would you describe everything, Douglas? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=169.4s)]
*  You've been to war zones, you were just in Ukraine a short time ago. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=171.04s)]
*  Were you wanting, checked out the world, uh, the, the side of the invasion, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=174.84s)]
*  uh, where the massacre took place? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=179.12s)]
*  What could you tell our listeners? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=180.76s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think that as I wrote in the New York post the other day, uh, the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=183.6s)]
*  world really still needs to know a lot more and to realize a lot more about the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=188.8s)]
*  horror that unfolded, um, on the morning of the 7th of October. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=193.24s)]
*  It was, um, a massacre, I think unprecedented in recent history, uh, for [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=198.28s)]
*  its barbarism, for its, uh, scale, uh, for the sheer, uh, sadistic glee that [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=204.36s)]
*  the Hamas terrorists took in, in the most atrocious acts of evil. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=213.08s)]
*  And I think that because as always happens in any war involving Israel, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=218.28s)]
*  people move straight onto what will the Israeli response be. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=223.28s)]
*  The world hasn't actually spent enough time, no one's had enough time to look [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=227.04s)]
*  at, uncover and realize actually what happened that day, because it was a [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=232.28s)]
*  battalion size attack of terrorists on Israel that day from sea, air, land. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=237.24s)]
*  Um, they went, they went as deep into the country as they could. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=244.92s)]
*  And, uh, I've both seen the sites of the massacres and, um, spent part of [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=249.04s)]
*  today talking with, uh, survivors and also the families of people who were [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=253.79999999999998s)]
*  kidnapped by Hamas and were taken into Gaza. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=260.0s)]
*  And that's a really, um, as you just heard from the prime minister's comments, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=263.32s)]
*  that that's the scale of that is something that really would, would, would [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=267.08s)]
*  horrify people. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=270.96s)]
*  Um, I spoke earlier to a man who's almost in his entire family, including [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=272.59999999999997s)]
*  all the young children kidnapped and have been taken into Gaza. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=279.32s)]
*  Nobody knows if they're alive, if they're well. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=283.28s)]
*  Uh, I spoke to another young woman who not only had her cousin abducted, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=286.32s)]
*  kidnapped, taken into Gaza by Hamas, but also her, her grandmother who's in her [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=290.15999999999997s)]
*  eighties has serious health issues, can't even get to the bathroom on her own. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=294.59999999999997s)]
*  And Hamas kidnapped her and there's footage of them gleefully taking this [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=299.76s)]
*  80 something year old woman on a golf cart and taking her into Gaza and just [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=305.56s)]
*  so happy about doing so, so happy about, about violating and, and abducting [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  and helped this old woman. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=317.64s)]
*  It really is, um, something which I think, which it's enough to shock even those [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=320.08s)]
*  of us who think we, we can't be shocked that much. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  How about the fact that among those things, and those are horrific, uh, we [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=328.56s)]
*  find out that a three year old American kid, three years old, whose parents were [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=332.76000000000005s)]
*  killed in front of them is also there. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=336.64000000000004s)]
*  So one of nine, and most of these people are, I mean, there's no rhyme or reason [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=338.8s)]
*  to take as much as you can. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=344.20000000000005s)]
*  And we know more of the game plan. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=345.16s)]
*  The game plan was to go deeper into Israel and kill more people in the [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=346.72s)]
*  most horrific way imaginable. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=350.76000000000005s)]
*  Well, Hamas's leaders have said that in recent days, which is if they get the [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=353.12s)]
*  chance, they plan to do this again and again and again. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=356.48s)]
*  And that's why I think there's an extraordinary unity in Israel. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=359.6s)]
*  Uh, Israel has obviously been a very divided country in recent times. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=362.88s)]
*  Every country has divisions as we all know, but when a country faces an [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=365.64000000000004s)]
*  atrocity like that, it really can come together and Israel really has. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=369.56s)]
*  And it's remarkable to see the young men and women and people of all ages doing [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=373.96000000000004s)]
*  whatever it is they can do, uh, to help their country and help their country [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=378.40000000000003s)]
*  win at this time. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=383.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=384.47999999999996s)]
*  Um, this is a bigger question, Douglas. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=384.79999999999995s)]
*  There's big push now for a ceasefire, for a pause to, uh, make sure civilian [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=388.2s)]
*  casualty, there's too many civilian casualties. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=392.55999999999995s)]
*  In fact, here is Emmanuel Macron cut one. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=394.4s)]
*  I think this is the only solution we have. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=397.03999999999996s)]
*  This is fire because it's impossible to explain. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=400.32s)]
*  We want to fight against terrorism by killing innocent people. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=404.4s)]
*  De facto, today, civilians are bombed. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=408.88s)]
*  De facto, there's babies, ladies, there's old people are bombed and killed. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=412.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=416.8s)]
*  That is true, but never the intention. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=417.68s)]
*  Uh, Emmanuel Macron says it's time to pull back. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=420.24s)]
*  Do you get any of that when you leave the, you've heard of that when you [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=422.88s)]
*  leave the country or read press from other nations, right? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=425.76s)]
*  What is the right thing to do? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=428.68s)]
*  Well, it's a very, what's very striking is that, uh, European leaders in [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=431.36s)]
*  particular and American leaders, to some extent are being, uh, very, very [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=436.52s)]
*  some extent are being pressured to call for the ceasefires and there have been [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=440.64000000000004s)]
*  the announcement of sort of four hour pauses is what the Israeli government [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=446.76s)]
*  say, it seems that the Israeli government was pushed into this actually not by [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=450.6s)]
*  Macron, but by, uh, president Biden. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=454.20000000000005s)]
*  Um, and that they couldn't resist the political pressure, which, which came [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=457.04s)]
*  from him to have these, these pauses. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=460.88s)]
*  Um, what's striking about it, of course, is that the Israelis are trying to [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=463.6s)]
*  move in and put a stranglehold on Hamas and the Gaza and any ceasefire, any, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=467.72s)]
*  any let up of that is of course only going to help Hamas. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=473.28000000000003s)]
*  Macron is an interesting case because of course he's saying this for [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=477.76000000000005s)]
*  domestic political reasons. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=481.44000000000005s)]
*  Don't forget, not only have they had huge protests on the streets of [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=483.40000000000003s)]
*  Paris and other cities in support of the Palestinians in recent weeks, but [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=487.0s)]
*  also of course, Macron banned protests and yet they went ahead. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=492.04s)]
*  So this is a, uh, um, a very, very tense situation for Trump as it is for America. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=497.03999999999996s)]
*  This, this conflict in Israel, this attack on Israel by Hamas has opened up [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=504.56s)]
*  serious fault lines in our own society, in France, in Britain, in America, in [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=511.23999999999995s)]
*  campuses in America, on the streets of America. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=517.4s)]
*  And as I've said, since this conflict began, um, Israel can and should look [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=520.52s)]
*  after itself, but we in America and in other countries in the West have to look [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=526.44s)]
*  after ourselves as well, because the same hatred is in our midst. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=531.48s)]
*  Look at the size of these crowds and these protests for Hamas, for the [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=536.0s)]
*  Palestinians. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=539.68s)]
*  Now there's going to be a huge pro-Israeli rally in Washington, DC. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=540.4s)]
*  I hope it's a pushback. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=544.52s)]
*  I hope a lot of these, uh, these donors start advertising and getting the word [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=545.44s)]
*  out about who the bad guys are. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=549.68s)]
*  But here's a bigger question, Douglas. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=551.4s)]
*  Is it possible to win a war the way we used to win wars in World War II? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=552.92s)]
*  Did we drop, did we, uh, worry about civilians in Berlin? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=557.4s)]
*  Do we worry about civilians in Nagasaki and Hiroshima? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=561.4s)]
*  Will we attack first? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=564.4399999999999s)]
*  Did we have a choice? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=565.7199999999999s)]
*  We had to win. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=566.5999999999999s)]
*  If you have to win a war, can you do it? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=567.8s)]
*  Israel is the only country in the world that is expected to give fuel and other [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=571.56s)]
*  necessities to its enemies in a war. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=576.48s)]
*  There's huge international appropriate for, for, for Israel not giving enough [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=579.36s)]
*  electricity supplies to Hamas. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=584.04s)]
*  I don't know of another conflict in history in which people were expected to [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=586.6800000000001s)]
*  help their enemies to this extent. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=590.64s)]
*  But the bigger question, the bigger, it is a bigger picture on this, Brian, and I [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=593.12s)]
*  don't need to tell you this, but this might be interesting for some listeners is [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=597.6800000000001s)]
*  that the atrocities in October was so appalling against Israel that, that [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=600.9599999999999s)]
*  doesn't matter whether you're on the right or the left, pro-Nesen Yahu or [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=608.24s)]
*  anti-Nesen Yahu, the revulsion is so complete. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=611.88s)]
*  And I mean, I just, uh, just literally now within the car back from a trauma [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=614.8399999999999s)]
*  hospital, uh, recovery unit, uh, where I was speaking with a very hard interview [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=619.0s)]
*  to do, I have to say with a father in one of the kibbutz on the communities near [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=625.68s)]
*  Gaza that was attacked and he, he lost his, his wife and, and 14 year old son [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=629.88s)]
*  who died beside him. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=635.28s)]
*  Um, and he said to me at the end of the interview, he said, you know, I'm of the [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=637.04s)]
*  left, lots of people in these kibbutz around Gaza are, they're peaceniks, they're [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=641.56s)]
*  pro-peace, peace activists, pro-Palestinian and much more. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=645.24s)]
*  He said, I'm of the left, but we cannot live with these people beside us. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=648.96s)]
*  And I don't think there's a single person in Israel at this stage who [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=654.08s)]
*  thinks that they can. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=657.36s)]
*  The status quo up to the beginning of October has been proven to be absolutely [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=658.84s)]
*  unlivable and so something big will change. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=663.96s)]
*  Israel, in my view, should be allowed to do what it needs to do to protect its [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=667.8000000000001s)]
*  citizenry. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=671.48s)]
*  And I just hope that the rest of the civilized world who's had little tastes [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=672.5600000000001s)]
*  of the terror that Israel had unleashed on it last month, stand behind Israel [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=675.96s)]
*  at this time of trial. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=680.96s)]
*  I hear you. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=683.4000000000001s)]
*  Um, it's just so good that you go there and you get a perspective. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=684.12s)]
*  And the thing is, I think it was so important to point out the people that [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=687.2s)]
*  they killed were the most sympathetic for the Palestinian cause and for Hamas. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=690.0400000000001s)]
*  A lot of them were volunteers. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=695.12s)]
*  These people that went to a concert, uh, were the least threatening to Hamas or [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=696.88s)]
*  a Palestinian in Israel. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=701.6s)]
*  And they're the ones who were the initial victims. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=703.5600000000001s)]
*  And then it went into the military and beyond. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=705.8000000000001s)]
*  Uh, Douglas, I look forward to catching up with you when you come back. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=708.12s)]
*  I look forward to it too, Brian. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=711.88s)]
*  Uh, stay safe. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=714.12s)]
*  One ATC calling us from traffic in Tel Aviv. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=714.88s)]
*  How great is that? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVnDDrtY0A&t=717.64s)]
