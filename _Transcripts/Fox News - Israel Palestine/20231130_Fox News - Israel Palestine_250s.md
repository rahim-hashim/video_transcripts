# Grieving father urges Biden to stop pushing for cease-fire
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfe7OjDfCqc)
*  Meanwhile, the fight against Hamas taking the lives of Americans, an Israeli soldier known as Moshe. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfe7OjDfCqc&t=0.0s)]
*  He was a major for the IDF reserves. He was killed by a booby trap tunnel in Gaza. He was only 39. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfe7OjDfCqc&t=6.32s)]
*  His father delivering a heartfelt message to President Biden, pleading for him to step back [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfe7OjDfCqc&t=12.96s)]
*  on any ceasefire calls. And his father is with me now, a brave man, Dr. Yekeel Leiter. And Dr, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfe7OjDfCqc&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  sorry for your loss. Super tough time. Thank you for agreeing to come on today. I want to share a [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfe7OjDfCqc&t=25.52s)]
*  little bit of your letter that you sent to President Biden. Here's what you write. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfe7OjDfCqc&t=32.64s)]
*  Stand back, Mr. President. Don't pressure us. Let us do what we know how to do, indeed what we must [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfe7OjDfCqc&t=37.2s)]
*  do to defeat evil. This is a war of virtue against depravity, of truth against lies, of civility [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfe7OjDfCqc&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  against murderous terrorism. It goes on from there and it's a strong letter. You're both from [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfe7OjDfCqc&t=51.04s)]
*  Scranton, Pennsylvania. We were told by the Pentagon spokesperson yesterday that the president [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfe7OjDfCqc&t=57.6s)]
*  will not tell Israel to back off if it goes back in, in a war footing in Gaza. Does that reassure [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfe7OjDfCqc&t=62.96s)]
*  you or what would you like to say now, Dr? Well, let me first thank you, Bill and Dana, for having [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfe7OjDfCqc&t=70.8s)]
*  me on. I think the first thing my son Moshe would have shared with you is to thank you for your [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfe7OjDfCqc&t=77.84s)]
*  moral clarity in reporting at a time of such moral confusion in the West. Israel's battle is not a [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfe7OjDfCqc&t=84.8s)]
*  battle over borders or a personal or local battle. It's a civilizational battle. Hamas is ISIS. And [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfe7OjDfCqc&t=92.56s)]
*  there was no ceasefire with ISIS. There was a declaration of the civilized nations to destroy [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfe7OjDfCqc&t=103.04s)]
*  ISIS. What Hamas has done to us, you just had a report about the raping of women as punishment. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfe7OjDfCqc&t=108.0s)]
*  This is something that is a norm. I just visited a family last night whose daughter was incinerated [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfe7OjDfCqc&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  by Hamas on October 7th. There's nothing left of her. This is a norm for these people and this is [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfe7OjDfCqc&t=122.0s)]
*  a threat to civilization, which has to be defeated. And it begins with moral clarity. So [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfe7OjDfCqc&t=126.96s)]
*  I thank you for that. And that would be the first message Moshe would like to share with you. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfe7OjDfCqc&t=133.84s)]
*  Wow. That's extraordinary. Listen, we could talk all day and I know you will among your [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfe7OjDfCqc&t=138.95999999999998s)]
*  family and friends. What do you want us to know about your son? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfe7OjDfCqc&t=143.92s)]
*  Well, first, you know, he was very connected to the American experience. He trained with the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfe7OjDfCqc&t=149.28s)]
*  Delta Force. And he was very proud of that fact. He visited quite often, although he was born here [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfe7OjDfCqc&t=154.88s)]
*  in Israel. And he traveled with his entire family to know the American experience and to appreciate [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfe7OjDfCqc&t=162.64s)]
*  the rich American history. And most importantly, he believed in the common values that we share [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfe7OjDfCqc&t=171.04s)]
*  in terms of the Judeo-Christian ethic and ensuring that our future is one of virtue and values [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfe7OjDfCqc&t=177.68s)]
*  and the belief in common ideals. And he was a father of six. His sixth child was just born [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfe7OjDfCqc&t=186.48s)]
*  three months ago. He won't know his dad. He was an excellent soldier. He knew the battlefield very [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfe7OjDfCqc&t=196.88s)]
*  well. He was at a battalion commander level. He was major, but he chose to go into this war [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfe7OjDfCqc&t=203.68s)]
*  as a squadron commander because his soldiers loved him and he loved them. So he chose to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfe7OjDfCqc&t=209.68s)]
*  lead the squadron into Beit Hanun. He was the point squadron of the entire division. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfe7OjDfCqc&t=217.12s)]
*  And the division commander told me that it was on Moshe's suggestion that the war [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfe7OjDfCqc&t=222.56s)]
*  aims or determined. So I'm very, very proud. I'm mourning for my son. He was my first born, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfe7OjDfCqc&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  but I'm also very, very proud of him. You raised a hell of a man. Thank you, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfe7OjDfCqc&t=237.44s)]
*  doctor. Stay strong and stay brave. Thank you very much. And thank you. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfe7OjDfCqc&t=242.4s)]
