# US Senate needs to take a ‘hard’ look in the mirror: GOP rep
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ)
*  Thank you. From the other side of the aisle, we're joined by Republican Congresswoman from [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Tennessee, Diana Harshberger. Thank you so much for being here today, Congresswoman. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=4.8s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=9.6s)]
*  First question has to do with Secretary of State Antony Blinken in the Middle East right [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=10.6s)]
*  now meeting with Arab leaders in Amman, Jordan. One of the topics that they are discussing [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=15.32s)]
*  is what a postwar reality would look like in the Middle East. In your mind, what would [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=20.88s)]
*  it be? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=26.8s)]
*  Well, they will probably talk about a two state solution. And look, I agree with Congressman [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=28.96s)]
*  Ami Barrett. Israel has a right to exist. Israel has a right to defend itself. So let [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=35.24s)]
*  Israel decide what it's going to do and let it protect its citizens. That's what I think. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=42.04s)]
*  So let's discuss this. A $14.5 billion aid package for Israel that was passed this week, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=49.04s)]
*  mostly along party lines, 12 Democrats joining Republicans. Senator Chuck Schumer called [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=56.24s)]
*  it quote, stunningly unserious because in part its funding would come from cutting money [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=61.32s)]
*  from the IRS. And the president has said he would veto it anyway. Let's listen to Democratic [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  Congressman Jared Moskowitz here and his criticism of Speaker Mike Johnson. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=71.08s)]
*  This was it. This was his first full week, first big boat, national security issue for [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=76.48s)]
*  the American people, a national security issue for Israel, our number one ally. And he played [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=81.36s)]
*  politics for it so that he could send out a political mailer. This was disgusting for [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=86.64s)]
*  Republicans to do this in the Jewish people's greatest time of need since the Holocaust. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  Now, Moskowitz, as you know, is Jewish. He voted yes. But what do you say to that criticism? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  Well, look, under Speaker Mike Johnson, the House did its job. We passed a supplemental [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  aid package to support one of our biggest allies in the Middle East, which is Israel. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=111.2s)]
*  And I thought it was brilliant the way he paid for that. He took a bloated Biden budget [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=117.16s)]
*  and he took money from the Inflation Reduction Act that was meant to hire 87,000 new IRS [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=122.8s)]
*  agents. And he used that to pay for this bill. You can't get any better than that when you're [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=128.44s)]
*  wanting to support your ally and also take money away from an administration who wants [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=135.44s)]
*  to look up the skirt of every hard, you know, working taxpayer in America, the middle class, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=142.2s)]
*  and use that money to do good and not to do harm to our American citizens. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=149.92s)]
*  But if it's not going to go anywhere, how does this help Israel? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=154.28s)]
*  Well, the Senate needs to take a hard look at theirself, look in the mirror and say, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=160.12s)]
*  would you rather, you know, send money to Ukraine instead of supporting the southern [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=165.88s)]
*  border? And when they do, they will realize that would you rather hire 87,000 more IRS [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=170.84s)]
*  agents or support your greatest ally in the Middle East, which is Israel? So I think they'll [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=177.36s)]
*  make the right decision. Hopefully they can say it's dead on arrival when it goes to the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=182.48s)]
*  Senate. But whatever they send us, if they want to put it with Ukraine funding, with [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=187.2s)]
*  border funding and not separate it, I think it'll be dead on arrival in the House. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=191.76s)]
*  And I want to quickly ask you about the holdup on confirmations of military nominees by Republican [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=197.0s)]
*  Senator Tommy Tuberville. This week we saw Republican senators criticizing their colleague [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=204.44s)]
*  and really pleading with him, the Defense Department doing the same thing. How do you [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=209.44s)]
*  read all of this? I know you're in the House and this is in the Senate, but what is the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=214.48000000000002s)]
*  impact do you think that this is having on our military and your party? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=218.04s)]
*  Well Senator Tuberville is saying, look, the Biden administration disregards the law. You [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=223.6s)]
*  know, they want to fund the VA, abortion for the VA, which is against the law. And he's [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=229.52s)]
*  taking a stand for the people he serves and saying, no, you're not going to do that. You [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=234.84s)]
*  know, he's offered to look at those nominees one by one, but they want to do it by a block. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=239.24s)]
*  So I applaud Senator Tuberville standing up for what he believes and, you know, they're [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=244.4s)]
*  going around him, circumventing him. And I think that's the wrong decision to make for [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=250.04000000000002s)]
*  both sides. Congresswoman Diana Harschberger, thank you [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=255.44s)]
*  so much for joining us today. My pleasure. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0B2Vl60VSQ&t=258.64s)]
