# US should help Israel first: Rep. Michael McCaul
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo)
*  All right, joining us now, House Foreign Affairs Committee chair, Texas Republican Michael [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=0.0s)]
*  McCaul. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=4.08s)]
*  Great to have you back with us, Mr. Chairman. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=5.08s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=6.08s)]
*  Let's start with Iran. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=7.08s)]
*  Overnight, their president said this on Twitter or X, whatever we're calling it now. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=8.08s)]
*  He says, Zionist regime's crimes have crossed the red lines, which may force everyone to [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=11.0s)]
*  take action. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=15.44s)]
*  Washington asks us not to do anything, but they keep giving widespread to Israel. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=17.12s)]
*  And he goes on from there. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=21.32s)]
*  This after the Defense Department says there have been 20 attacks on U.S. troops in that [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  region by Iranian proxies. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=26.48s)]
*  We have the Iranian foreign minister standing up at the UN here basically threatening the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=28.2s)]
*  United States on U.S. soil. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=32.28s)]
*  What do we do about Iran? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=34.12s)]
*  Well, he talks about, you know, putting the United States on fire if this happens. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=35.12s)]
*  You know, this is really started by Iran, really by their proxies. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=38.56s)]
*  Hamas is a proxy of Iran. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=43.08s)]
*  Hezbollah, we don't want Hezbollah to light up. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=44.92s)]
*  They have 100,000 rockets they can fire in, overload the Iron Dome. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=47.08s)]
*  And meanwhile, they've been also the militia groups in Iraq and Syria have been hitting [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=51.239999999999995s)]
*  our troops in Iraq and Syria. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=56.0s)]
*  Finally, the administration is responding to this. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=58.0s)]
*  Also they put aircraft carrier strike groups in the Mediterranean and Persian Gulf for [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=61.24s)]
*  deterrence to ensure that this does not escalate. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=66.36s)]
*  But that's our biggest concern. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=69.78s)]
*  Well, where are you on? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  We've talked about on this show that Senator Graham has said, listen, we should go after [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=72.4s)]
*  Iran's oil infrastructure. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=77.32000000000001s)]
*  At least they should think that we will actually physically attack it if they continue to press [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=78.32000000000001s)]
*  some of these issues. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  I think, you know, the sanctions, we have not enforced sanctions on Iranian oil. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=84.44000000000001s)]
*  And so we've had about 30 to 60 billion dollars they've made money off of by evading our sanctions. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=89.64s)]
*  That goes straight into funding of terrorist organizations like Hamas, like Hezbollah. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=96.72s)]
*  In addition, the six billion dollars part of this hostage negotiation, I'm going to [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  mark up a bill next week to sanction that money from ever going into Iran. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=106.4s)]
*  There's no reason to put six billion dollars into the biggest state sponsor of terror. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=112.16s)]
*  OK, there are a lot of other countries weighing in and many of them, we know that they're [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=117.88s)]
*  enemies. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  I mean, Iran clearly wants to destroy America, but we've got Turkey. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  And I want to put up some video of a massive pro-Palestinian demonstration there yesterday. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=127.12s)]
*  The estimates are there were hundreds of thousands of people in the street. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  Turkey's president stood there, Erdogan, and said that Israel is an occupier. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=135.6s)]
*  He said they are committing war crimes. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=138.84s)]
*  He says Hamas is not a terrorist organization. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=140.32s)]
*  This is a NATO ally of ours. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=143.28s)]
*  What do you say to Turkey at this moment? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=146.56s)]
*  A precarious NATO ally that wouldn't let Sweden into NATO for a while. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=147.76s)]
*  Hopefully they will now. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=152.92s)]
*  I would tell them to stop this. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=154.2s)]
*  Historically, look, this is part of the Ottoman Empire. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=156.84s)]
*  It goes way back to Turkish roots. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=159.2s)]
*  I think Erdogan envisions himself as an Ottoman Empire ruler, if you will. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=161.76s)]
*  The fact that he's supporting Hamas and is a NATO ally, and guess who else is? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=167.44s)]
*  Mr. Putin. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=172.0s)]
*  Hamas visited him at the Kremlin. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=173.0s)]
*  And we're seeing now the solidification of Russia, China, and Iran all together in this. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=176.60000000000002s)]
*  They're all allies against the West and the United States. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  And so China this week, they had an incursion with one of our planes over the South China [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=186.68s)]
*  Sea that was within 10 feet of one of our planes. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=191.48000000000002s)]
*  At the same time, their foreign minister is here negotiating now. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=194.84s)]
*  Apparently, their reports are going to be a meeting between Presidents Xi and Biden [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=197.4s)]
*  in the next month or two. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  What is our message to China? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=203.68s)]
*  What should the White House message be? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=204.96s)]
*  Deescalate the tension. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=206.68s)]
*  When I was in Taiwan, they circled it with 10 battleships, aircraft carriers, 70 fighter [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=208.32s)]
*  jets. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=213.6s)]
*  As you mentioned, our B-52 fighter jet came 10 feet away from that. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=214.6s)]
*  The Chinese Coast Guard, baying into a Philippine vessel, almost sunk it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=219.64s)]
*  So the message is get something out of this meeting, for God sakes. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=225.6s)]
*  They always meet, and it's good to talk. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=229.2s)]
*  But we want lines of communication between our military and theirs, which we don't have [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=231.27999999999997s)]
*  right now. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=235.64s)]
*  And I would also argue that Mark Swiden from Texas, he's been in China for 11 years as [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=236.72s)]
*  a hostage. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=242.48s)]
*  He is very sick. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=243.76s)]
*  He's a prisoner now on death row for bogus drug charge. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=245.44s)]
*  There's a lot to discuss there. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=250.24s)]
*  In the meantime, there's a supplemental bill now coming to the Hill from the White House, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=252.2s)]
*  more than $100 billion for a number of things. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=256.64s)]
*  There are a number of Republicans who are now stepping forward to say they don't want [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=259.12s)]
*  Israel thrown in with all of these other things, Ukraine and all the other stuff. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=262.32s)]
*  Ted Cruz is leading the effort over with Senator Roger Marshall in the Senate. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=265.48s)]
*  He says, We should vote on Israel military assistance free and clear. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=268.84s)]
*  It would pass overwhelmingly. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=272.72s)]
*  And every other thing attached to it is the swamp at its very worst. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=274.4s)]
*  New House Speaker Mike Johnson says he thinks there's consensus among most of the House [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=278.56s)]
*  GOP to also separate it out. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=282.32s)]
*  What happens? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=284.2s)]
*  Well, I was with the new speaker. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=285.2s)]
*  I'm glad we have one now at the Situation Room in the White House with Jake Sullivan [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=286.71999999999997s)]
*  talking about this very issue. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=292.44s)]
*  I think what we want to do is really because the need is so urgent now in Israel is to [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=294.03999999999996s)]
*  start with Israel first and then deal with the other. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=298.84s)]
*  As a separate measure. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=301.84s)]
*  As a separate measure. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=302.84s)]
*  We've got that on the House floor this week. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=304.28s)]
*  OK. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=305.28s)]
*  But we can't forget about the other adversaries linked to Iran, which is causing the problems [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=306.28s)]
*  in Israel. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=312.2s)]
*  And that is Russia in Ukraine and Europe and the threat also of China to the Pacific. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=313.23999999999995s)]
*  And also, lastly, Shannon, most importantly for me and my constituents, the border itself. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=318.35999999999996s)]
*  We have to get this thing under control because it's way out of control. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=324.17999999999995s)]
*  Well, yeah, DHS is warning that terrorists and criminals and others will try to capitalize [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=327.88s)]
*  on what's happening in the world right now because of just how porous our border is. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=331.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean, we talked before the show started about the record number of people attached [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=335.2s)]
*  to the terror watch list that are showing up at our border. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=339.0s)]
*  And those are just the ones we know about. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=341.6s)]
*  Now, when I chaired Homeland Security, I always looked at those numbers. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=342.96000000000004s)]
*  How many on the terror watch list? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=345.48s)]
*  How many special interest aliens? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=346.64000000000004s)]
*  We've had 200. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=348.40000000000003s)]
*  It only took 19 hijackers, right? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=349.40000000000003s)]
*  We need to stop the magnet, which is political asylum, go back to the policies that worked, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=352.16s)]
*  which was remain in Mexico, migrant protection protocols. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=356.8s)]
*  I brought this up to the White House. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=359.84000000000003s)]
*  It wouldn't cost a whole lot of money. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=361.72s)]
*  It's just a change in policy where their claims are adjudicated outside the United States, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=363.16s)]
*  not inside, because once they're inside the United States, like seven million have been, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=367.8s)]
*  they are released. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=372.88000000000005s)]
*  Chairman, always good to see you. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeTPAJsugOo&t=373.88000000000005s)]
