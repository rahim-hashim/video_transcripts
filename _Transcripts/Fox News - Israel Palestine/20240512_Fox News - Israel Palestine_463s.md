# This is another reason why Joe Biden is unfit for office: Sen. Mike Lee
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [May 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc)
*  Joining me now in this Sunday Morning Futures exclusive is Utah Senator Mike Lee, the ranking [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=0.0s)]
*  member of the Senate Joint Economic Committee. Senator, it's good to see you this morning. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=4.36s)]
*  Thanks very much for being here. I want to start off with your reaction to President [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=8.32s)]
*  Biden threatening he's not going to send those shipments of weapons to Israel if they go [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=11.6s)]
*  into Rafa. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=15.6s)]
*  Maria, this is just reprehensible. You're taking a group of people who have been victimized. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=16.6s)]
*  Remember that there were thousands of people killed innocently, innocent people who were [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=22.88s)]
*  killed in Israel, men, women, children, even babies. And they're the victims. Now they're [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=28.68s)]
*  being re-victimized by, of all people, the United States of America. Congress, moreover, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=34.36s)]
*  has recently passed an aid package, an aid package I voted against because, among other [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=39.16s)]
*  things, it's spent too much on other countries and because I was concerned that the aid wouldn't [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=44.32s)]
*  actually make it to Israel. Well, lo and behold, a lot of it's not going to Israel, or at least [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=49.08s)]
*  it's being conditioned on Israel not being able to defend itself. This is inexcusable. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=53.72s)]
*  And I really don't know how Joe Biden can survive this. I think this is yet another [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  indication that it's time for change at the White House. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=64.32s)]
*  You know, I was speaking with some voters last night and, you know, they felt that this [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=67.48s)]
*  was a red line. They couldn't believe it. This was like the final straw. These were [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=72.44s)]
*  Democrats in independence. Do you think this is going to affect how people see the upcoming [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=76.44s)]
*  election? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  Without question, it will, and it certainly should. Look, nothing calls out more for Donald [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=83.22s)]
*  Trump returning to the White House as the 47th president of the United States, quite [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=88.66s)]
*  like blunders like this one. And this one is a doozy. It's colossal because it demonstrates [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=93.14s)]
*  to the American people and it demonstrates to people all over the world that we've got [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=99.18s)]
*  flawed, we've got inadequate, we've got ineffective, feckless leadership in the White House. That [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=104.22s)]
*  has to come to an end. And that'll happen, I believe, when Americans go to the polls [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=109.46s)]
*  this November. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=114.38s)]
*  Senator, let me just look at this one story. I've got to get your take from the Washington [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=115.38s)]
*  Post. The Washington Post apparently got this leak from, I assume, the Biden administration, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=118.96s)]
*  but it says that the administration is working urgently to stave off a full-scale Israeli [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=124.44s)]
*  invasion of Ra'aq, and they claim that they will give Israel valuable, let's put it this [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=129.01999999999998s)]
*  valuable assistance if it holds back, including the U.S. will share sensitive intelligence [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=135.74s)]
*  to Israel to help the Israeli military pinpoint the location of the Hamas leaders to find [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=141.74s)]
*  them in hidden tunnels. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=147.4s)]
*  So in other words, the Washington Post is writing that Israel, that the United States [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=148.4s)]
*  will share information about where the terrorists are with Israel if they don't go into Ra'aq. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=153.78s)]
*  Are you kidding me? In other words, the U.S. knows where the terrorists are. They're not [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=159.5s)]
*  going to share the information with Israel unless Israel doesn't go into Ra'aq. This [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=163.24s)]
*  story is outrageous in the Washington Post. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=166.84s)]
*  The story is outrageous. The facts underlying it are tragic. Look, this is extortion. We're [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=170.68s)]
*  saying we can help you locate your victims who have been kept under just horrible, horrific [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=177.8s)]
*  conditions, the worst anyone can imagine. We will share that information with you if [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=185.04000000000002s)]
*  and only if you choose not to defend yourselves. We are re-victimizing the victim nation here. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=189.76s)]
*  This is terrible. And again, yet another reason why Joe Biden is unfit for office and Americans [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=196.44s)]
*  need to elect Donald Trump. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=201.68s)]
*  Let's talk about the bill that you are pushing, the SAVE Act. And I want to get your take [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=203.6s)]
*  on a free and fair election come November. Tell us about the SAVE Act. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=208.24s)]
*  Look, in our country, it's always been one citizen, one vote. And under federal law, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=215.72s)]
*  only citizens are allowed to vote in federal elections. Here's the tragic thing, Maria. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=222.36s)]
*  Over the last three, three and a half years since the Biden administration has been in [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=228.48000000000002s)]
*  power, they've let in about 12 million illegal aliens, or an estimated nearly 30 million [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=232.64000000000001s)]
*  non-citizens in the United States. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=238.96s)]
*  Currently, with the laws we have in place, the so-called motor voter law, the National [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=241.76000000000002s)]
*  Voter Registration Act, you do still have to be a citizen to vote. But the Supreme Court [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=247.56s)]
*  has interpreted it as prohibiting those at the state level who register people to vote [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=254.22s)]
*  from requiring the production of evidence of documents proving citizenship, just like [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=260.72s)]
*  you have to show when you get, say, a passport. They're prohibited from asking for that. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=267.20000000000005s)]
*  And so what that means is a person can fill out a form as long as they check the right [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=273.44s)]
*  box and sign their name and are willing to lie. They can vote in federal elections, even [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=276.52000000000004s)]
*  if they're not citizens, and they couldn't prove it because they're not citizens. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=282.08000000000004s)]
*  The SAVE Act would fix that loophole. It would make sure that actually it is going to be [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=285.88s)]
*  American citizens voting in federal elections. It would require the states to go in and review [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=291.59999999999997s)]
*  their voter registration files and eliminate those who are not citizens. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=298.2s)]
*  This is so important. And I know that the RNC and Michael Watley and Larry Trump have [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=302.96s)]
*  been saying that a fair and transparent election is their number one priority. What kind of [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=307.35999999999996s)]
*  a reception are you getting on the SAVE Act from your colleagues? Because this wide open [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=313.24s)]
*  border has people questioning whether or not illegals are going to vote in the upcoming [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=318.1s)]
*  election. And what is the motivation for the administration to keep this wide open border? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=322.82000000000005s)]
*  Ken Paxton, the AG of Texas, last week told me that he thinks when they cross the border, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=327.78000000000003s)]
*  officials are giving them Social Security numbers and they're giving them voter registration [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=334.1s)]
*  sheets. What about that? Do you have any evidence of that? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=338.34000000000003s)]
*  Well, yeah, it's happening all over the place. And in all 50 states now, you can get a driver's [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=343.65999999999997s)]
*  license without being a citizen. So that coupled with the motor voter law means that it's going [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=348.21999999999997s)]
*  to be very, very easy if people requested and checked the box to actually become a voter who [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=354.21999999999997s)]
*  can vote in federal elections. Now, with respect to your question about the kind of reception it's [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=360.38s)]
*  getting, universally, Republicans love it. I believe some Democrats love it, but there are [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=364.86s)]
*  a number of Democrats who are belittling it and saying there's no need for it because they come [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=370.46s)]
*  out and say, oh, well, of course, it's already illegal for noncitizens to vote. That's not the [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=376.06s)]
*  point. The point is that it's nearly impossible to enforce that law and it's nearly impossible [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=381.82s)]
*  to stop people from cheating and just checking a box, signing their name fraudulently, claiming [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=387.34s)]
*  to be citizens. The SAVE Act would fix that. We need to pass the SAVE Act immediately. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=392.06s)]
*  Real quick on inflation, which was one of the topics last night for the president, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=397.34s)]
*  President Trump at his New Jersey rally. Wow. The pictures were extraordinary of all of those [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=401.65999999999997s)]
*  people. Senator, we are still looking at inflation up almost 20 percent on Joe Biden's watch. Why? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=405.74s)]
*  Well, this is the predictable, foreseeable, and in fact, by many of us, actually foreseen result [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=414.14s)]
*  of years of back to back multi-trillion dollar deficits. It is no mystery what inflation is [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=420.14s)]
*  caused by. It's caused by the federal government spending too much money it doesn't have, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=427.18s)]
*  effectively printing it. It makes every dollar go less far. That's why household after household [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=431.18s)]
*  in America on average is shelling out an additional $1,300 every month just to live. That's wrong and [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=435.97999999999996s)]
*  that's another reason why we need Donald Trump as president. Senator, it's good to see you this [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=441.97999999999996s)]
*  morning. Thanks very much. We will see you soon. Senator Mike Lee in Utah. Thank you, sir. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HJbQ_P_YMc&t=445.5s)]
