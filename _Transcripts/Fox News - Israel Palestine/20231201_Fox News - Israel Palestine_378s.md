# Netanyahu adviser: Hostages went through abuse after abuse
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA)
*  Right now, Qatari officials are working to repair another truce between Israel and Hamas [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=0.0s)]
*  after a week-long pause in fighting. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=4.4s)]
*  Israel says more than 130 hostages still remain captive in Gaza at this hour. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=7.28s)]
*  And just moments ago, we just got word from the IDF. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=13.84s)]
*  The IDF has announced the death of a fifth hostage now, a 75-year-old man from Kibbutz [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=18.36s)]
*  near Oz. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=24.8s)]
*  Let's bring in Mark Regev, senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=25.8s)]
*  and former Israeli ambassador to the U.K. Ambassador, welcome to you. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  And I'm sorry for leading into you with that horrific news. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=33.92s)]
*  First, your reaction to that. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=37.84s)]
*  So it's clear that Hamas is brutal and that we are extremely worried about how they're [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=42.88s)]
*  treating the hostages that have remained behind. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=50.040000000000006s)]
*  We're thankful that we got 81 Israelis out, 81 Israelis who were in Hamas's dungeons. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=53.08s)]
*  They are out. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=61.96s)]
*  Unfortunately, as you said just now, there's more than 130 still left behind. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=63.2s)]
*  And that's a problem. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=68.66s)]
*  We've been hearing stories from the medical teams that have been dealing with the hostages [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=69.66s)]
*  come out, and they are saying that the hostages went through a very difficult time, the ones [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=74.64s)]
*  that are now out and can talk. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=81.92s)]
*  Abuse after abuse after abuse. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=84.36s)]
*  Children suffered abuse at Hamas's hands. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=87.08s)]
*  But maybe we shouldn't be surprised. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=90.76s)]
*  We saw the way Hamas behaved when they invaded Israel on October 7th, when they butchered [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=92.28s)]
*  our people, when they burned families alive, when they machine-gunned the young people [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=97.68s)]
*  at the open air music concert. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=102.04s)]
*  We know what we're dealing with. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=105.8s)]
*  Hamas are brutal killers. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=107.48s)]
*  We can have no illusions. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=109.24000000000001s)]
*  Ambassador, just reading through the update from the IDF spokesperson here about this [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=111.64s)]
*  now, fifth hostage pronounced dead, this through the IDF, the name of that hostage we are told, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=116.28s)]
*  Eliyahu Marguliet, 75 years old, from Kibbutz near Oz. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=124.6s)]
*  Eliyahu's daughter, we are told in this update, was Neely Marguliet, who was released last [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=131.16s)]
*  night. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=137.4s)]
*  To clarify, and reading directly from the note coming from the IDF here, the bodies [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=139.2s)]
*  of these five people, these hostages, are still being held right now by Hamas in Gaza. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=144.4s)]
*  They're still being counted in the total number of 136 hostages. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=152.88s)]
*  We believe that to be the case, at least. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=157.16s)]
*  We're waiting for an exact response from the IDF on that. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=159.72s)]
*  What can you tell us about the negotiations now that this week-long ceasefire is over? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=164.12s)]
*  Why did they fall apart? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=168.12s)]
*  Well, Hamas took a decision that they didn't want to honor the understandings that were [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=169.72s)]
*  reached. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=177.6s)]
*  And as you know, the United States played a key role in reaching those understandings. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=178.6s)]
*  And Hamas was supposed to release hostages, and for releasing hostages, more hostages, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=183.84s)]
*  we were willing to extend the humanitarian pause. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=188.96s)]
*  But for its own reasons, Hamas not only didn't follow through on its commitments about hostages, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=192.92s)]
*  but Hamas also opened fire. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=201.28s)]
*  And this morning at about 5.30 a.m. local time, there was rockets being fired from Gaza [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=203.48s)]
*  into Israel. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  And so they broke the quiet by attacking us, and at the same time, they weren't following [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=210.68s)]
*  through on their commitments under the understandings. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=217.07999999999998s)]
*  And so they jettisoned the pause. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=219.95999999999998s)]
*  And if the people of Gaza are now once again in a war zone, they have no one to look to [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=224.95999999999998s)]
*  except for Hamas, who has deliberately, in a premeditated action, started the war once [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=231.2s)]
*  again. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=238.92s)]
*  Just reading through some updates from the White House's John Kirby, who is speaking [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=240.51999999999998s)]
*  right now to this, answering that very question, Ambassador, why the negotiations fell apart. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=244.52s)]
*  His response is because of Hamas, that this pause has ended. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=251.56s)]
*  Some other things that he's saying right now, and I'll get reaction from you as I read these. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=257.04s)]
*  It's more than plausible, Kirby says, that Hamas has more women and children hostages [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=261.48s)]
*  who could qualify for an exchange. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=267.52s)]
*  He also says in these remarks, Gaza must remain Palestinian land and cannot be reduced. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=272.12s)]
*  I'll get your thoughts on both of those items as they're just now coming across the wire, Ambassador. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=279.4s)]
*  So we agree. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=286.32s)]
*  We believe there are more women and children that Hamas could have returned. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=288.68s)]
*  And we agree that Israel doesn't want to occupy or rule Gaza. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=296.48s)]
*  We're only in this war to protect our people. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=301.72s)]
*  We're only in this war to create a situation where Israelis who live on the southern frontier [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=304.6s)]
*  no longer have to live in fear of terrorist murderers crossing the border in the middle [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=309.44000000000005s)]
*  of the night and butchering their children. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=313.8s)]
*  We're only in this because Hamas says that given the capability and given the opportunity, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=316.56s)]
*  they would do the October 7th massacre again and again and again. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=321.52000000000004s)]
*  Their words are not mine. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=326.28000000000003s)]
*  So our action is defensive. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=328.88s)]
*  And the goal is, and it's shared with the United States, we have to create a new reality [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=331.44s)]
*  in Gaza where that territory is no longer ruled by a terrorist group. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=334.88s)]
*  And our model is what the United States did when you led that coalition to destroy ISIS [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=342.0s)]
*  in Syria and Iraq. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=346.0s)]
*  ISIS had what they call their caliphate. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=348.44s)]
*  They control territory where they could inflict pain on others from that territory. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=350.21999999999997s)]
*  So just as ISIS was destroyed in Syria and Iraq, we will destroy Hamas in Gaza. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=355.9s)]
*  Ambassador, we appreciate your time today. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=362.62s)]
*  Mark Ragev, thank you. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U71uZQW9KA&t=364.73999999999995s)]
