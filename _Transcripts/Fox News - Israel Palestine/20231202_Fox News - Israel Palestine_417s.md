# Hamas broke the cease-fire since it started: Fleur Hassan-Nahoum
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg)
*  A lot of people said the seven day pause in activity [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=0.0s)]
*  might have gone on an eighth, ninth, or tenth day, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  had a certain incident not occurred last week in Jerusalem [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=6.3s)]
*  where there were Hamas attacks on Israeli citizens. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=9.14s)]
*  Four were killed in Jerusalem [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=13.64s)]
*  as well as five others injured. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=15.22s)]
*  The Deputy Mayor of Jerusalem, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=17.02s)]
*  kind enough to join us right now, Fleur Hassan Nahum. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=18.78s)]
*  Very good to have you, Mayor. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=22.38s)]
*  Do you think when you look back at that pause ending [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=24.42s)]
*  that the attack in your city might've been a big reason? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=29.08s)]
*  Well, the truth is, Neil, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=34.18s)]
*  that they've been breaking the ceasefire [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=35.96s)]
*  from the very first minute that it started. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=38.06s)]
*  It started last Friday and between seven and 715, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=40.6s)]
*  which was supposed to be the first 15 minutes [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=44.46s)]
*  of the ceasefire, we had a barrage of rockets. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=46.46s)]
*  In the middle of the week, we had attacks in Gaza [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=49.86s)]
*  to soldiers that were near the border. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=53.14s)]
*  And then we had that horrific attack [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=55.879999999999995s)]
*  on innocent people waiting for a bus [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=58.2s)]
*  that was claimed by Hamas. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=60.74s)]
*  So they always keep trying to push the limits. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=62.7s)]
*  It's the same with the hostages they're going to free. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=65.38s)]
*  Every day, every day we're living with our hearts [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=68.12s)]
*  in our throats to see who's gonna be on that list. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=72.08s)]
*  If it's going to be what they promised, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=75.08s)]
*  are they changing it? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=76.92s)]
*  Are they twisting it? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=77.86s)]
*  Are they taking off two people? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=79.0s)]
*  Are they adding on two people? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=80.36s)]
*  What do you do if it's six people and not eight people? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=81.9s)]
*  What about those families? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=84.06s)]
*  This is psychological warfare and enough is enough. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=85.72s)]
*  You know, Mayor, we're learning that there are 136 hostages [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=89.02s)]
*  still being held in Gaza. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=93.46s)]
*  Then we come to learn that that includes six [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=96.66s)]
*  who have since been killed [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=100.06s)]
*  and their bodies are still in Gaza. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=101.6s)]
*  So the numbers and the updates change by the day. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=104.66s)]
*  So I don't wanna be morbid about it Mayor, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=108.4s)]
*  but how do we know only that many are dead [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=110.74s)]
*  that Hamas is stringing us along? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=113.6s)]
*  We don't. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=116.7s)]
*  And the worst thing is that we can't even get proof of life [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=117.84s)]
*  and even worse that the Red Cross [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=120.54s)]
*  are really not being activated. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=122.74000000000001s)]
*  They're not going, they claim they're not letting them in. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=124.74000000000001s)]
*  The Red Cross used to talk to Boko Haram in Africa. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=127.28s)]
*  Are you really telling me that they work with Gaza [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=130.88s)]
*  the whole time they're working in Gaza, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=133.22s)]
*  but this is something that they can't do. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=135.52s)]
*  So there's something very sinister going on [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=137.86s)]
*  where even these global organizations [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=140.26s)]
*  are part of this. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=143.18s)]
*  It could be that half of the hostages are dead. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=144.38s)]
*  We don't know anything and we're in the hands [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=146.85999999999999s)]
*  of these genocidal terrorists [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=149.7s)]
*  and God knows who are alive, who are dead. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=151.95999999999998s)]
*  We also hear that they took bodies with them [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=156.6s)]
*  over the border in order to continue playing [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=159.26s)]
*  these psychological warfare games. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=161.5s)]
*  Do you ever feel the pressure of the global community? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=164.04s)]
*  I was raising this with a number of your colleagues [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=170.24s)]
*  in Israel all the way up to the chief advisor [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=171.5s)]
*  to Benjamin Netanyahu about how the world [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=173.79999999999998s)]
*  lays your response to the Hamas attacks, that you overdo it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=177.04s)]
*  And then all but ignores the attack [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=182.57999999999998s)]
*  that you experienced in Jerusalem [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=186.33999999999997s)]
*  where more Israelis were killed. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=188.32s)]
*  The focus is on atrocities by Israel [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  and not atrocities by Hamas. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  First of all, there's no atrocities by Israel. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=198.84s)]
*  We're in war, a war that we didn't start [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=201.58s)]
*  and that's just war. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=204.28s)]
*  Nobody talks about the fact that three Israeli hospitals [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=206.28s)]
*  were hit in the last month, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=208.66s)]
*  but everybody's obsessed with our Shefa hospital [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=210.32s)]
*  which in fact turned out to be a terror base. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=212.48000000000002s)]
*  And so there's a lot of double standards here, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=215.12s)]
*  things that are never reported. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=217.20000000000002s)]
*  Wise people talk about our missiles [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=219.12s)]
*  hitting terror targets in Gaza. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=221.44s)]
*  Nobody talks about our innocence [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=223.52s)]
*  being the victims of a barrage of rockets. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=225.68s)]
*  People have died, houses have been hit. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=228.04000000000002s)]
*  It's just the double standards. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=230.6s)]
*  It's almost too much to bear. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=232.48000000000002s)]
*  And thankfully we have good friends [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=234.56s)]
*  that actually do believe us [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=236.98000000000002s)]
*  and know right from wrong and good from evil. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=238.36s)]
*  Do you ever feel even at the level as a deputy mayor [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  that the pressure even from the United States [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=246.0s)]
*  and we're told that our secretary, Anthony Blinken [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=249.9s)]
*  was sort of saying, I don't wanna mis-paraphrase it mayor, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=251.92000000000002s)]
*  go slow or be careful or watch, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=256.36s)]
*  have a measured response. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=257.56s)]
*  It wasn't apparently, and I wasn't there, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=258.8s)]
*  received well by some of your colleagues, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=261.32s)]
*  but that notwithstanding, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=263.12s)]
*  how do you respond to pressure like that? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=265.0s)]
*  Look, first of all, America and President Biden [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=268.32s)]
*  have been amazing. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=271.28000000000003s)]
*  They've stood by us from the first moment. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=272.16s)]
*  The president came here within the first few days. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  They sent two fleets to the Gulf. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=276.6s)]
*  All of these things are deterrents [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=278.88s)]
*  for a wider regional conflict. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=280.48s)]
*  And we're very, very appreciative [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=282.3s)]
*  of the American, not just the government, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=284.2s)]
*  really all sides of the political spectrum, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=287.36s)]
*  as well as the people of the United States of America. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=289.96s)]
*  At the same time, they also have a role to play here [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=292.84s)]
*  and they are kind of acting as mediators. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=295.92s)]
*  At the same time, I think that many people [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=298.84s)]
*  are asking the impossible of us. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=301.12s)]
*  They're saying, destroy Hamas, but don't kill innocent people. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=302.44s)]
*  And when Hamas are hiding because they're cowards, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=306.36s)]
*  they're hiding behind innocent people. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=309.76s)]
*  That's almost impossible. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=312.0s)]
*  I was asked in a radio interview the other day on BBC, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=313.04s)]
*  well, why don't you get rid of Hamas, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=315.68s)]
*  which everybody understands in our genocidal terrorists, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=318.16s)]
*  but don't harm any people. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=321.20000000000005s)]
*  And I said, well, if anybody can give us the formula [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=323.24s)]
*  how to do that, then that person [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=325.76000000000005s)]
*  should get the Nobel Peace Prize. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=328.06s)]
*  I'd like to get your thoughts quickly, if I can, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=331.12s)]
*  Mayor, on Qatar and these talks [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=332.92s)]
*  out of which the Israeli delegation left, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=335.6s)]
*  for whatever reason that Hamas wasn't doing enough. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=339.36s)]
*  They were going nowhere. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=341.32000000000005s)]
*  But if you think about Qatar houses [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=342.40000000000003s)]
*  a lot of Hamas bigwigs, and Israel, of course, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=345.04s)]
*  has said that they're gonna continue to track them down [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=348.28000000000003s)]
*  all over the world, presumably including Qatar. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=351.0s)]
*  So do you have mixed feelings about Qatar's so-called help [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=353.52000000000004s)]
*  in negotiating a truce and all of that that comes with it? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=358.0s)]
*  Qatar wants to be both the fire starter [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=363.36s)]
*  and the fire extinguisher. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=367.2s)]
*  That's the double game they're playing. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=370.92s)]
*  They want to be relevant. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=373.68s)]
*  They want to be friendly with the United States. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=374.94s)]
*  They want to be friendly with Iran. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=376.64000000000004s)]
*  They are sending money to the Gaza Strip. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=378.46000000000004s)]
*  They are housing them. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=382.78000000000003s)]
*  And now they want to be seen as the mediator [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=384.24s)]
*  and gain relevance as this international government [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=386.92s)]
*  that can bring results. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=391.0s)]
*  Qatar are very dangerous [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=392.68s)]
*  because they're playing a double game. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=394.92s)]
*  Like I said, they're starting the fire, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=396.52000000000004s)]
*  and then they want the world to recognize [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=398.68s)]
*  that they're putting out the same fire that they started. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=400.36s)]
*  Mayor, thank you very much for taking the time. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_sn04rhCtg&t=403.16s)]
