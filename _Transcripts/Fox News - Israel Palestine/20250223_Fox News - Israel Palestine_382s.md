# Michael Waltz: Trump is a ‘president’ of peace
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [February 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o)
*  Joining me now with the very latest on this two-front debacle is the National Security [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=0.0s)]
*  Advisor of the United States, Michael Waltz. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=3.6s)]
*  Sir, great to see you, Michael. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Thanks very much for being here today. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=8.48s)]
*  Yeah, thanks, Maria. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=10.44s)]
*  And just to build on both Secretary Besson and Ambassador Witkoff's comments there, what [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=13.68s)]
*  you're seeing under President Trump's leadership in just under a month is bringing multiple [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=19.52s)]
*  wars to an end. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=24.94s)]
*  He is a president of peace. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=26.04s)]
*  And on the Ukraine-Russia side, you're seeing, number one, a reformulation of how the United [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=27.52s)]
*  States provides aid, a partnership with Ukraine economically in their critical minerals, and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=33.1s)]
*  really reformulating that so that the American people can see a return on this massive investment [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=38.72s)]
*  they've made. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=46.16s)]
*  That's one. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=47.16s)]
*  Number two, we go to a ceasefire. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=48.16s)]
*  Number three, we reformulate how the United States deals with Russia. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=49.16s)]
*  We saw that first step with President Trump talking to both Putin and Zelensky, and then [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=54.44s)]
*  the further engagement in Riyadh. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=59.72s)]
*  And then, number four, engagement with our European allies, as you see the president [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=61.92s)]
*  of France and the prime minister of the United Kingdom coming to Washington this week. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=66.0s)]
*  And we welcome their ideas for security guarantees and European leadership to take care of Europe's [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=71.72s)]
*  security going forward. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=79.32s)]
*  All of that is happening at the same time that we're getting our hostages out of the Middle East. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=82.4s)]
*  Steve Wittkopf leading that effort. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=87.4s)]
*  And by the way, we must see the destruction of Hamas and Iran staying on its back foot, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=90.08s)]
*  for which all options are on the table. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=96.6s)]
*  One month, Maria, under President Trump's leadership. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=99.2s)]
*  And I haven't even gotten to the border, the cartels, deportation and everything else that's going on. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=102.28s)]
*  You're right. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=107.8s)]
*  You're doing an incredible job. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=108.8s)]
*  The administration handling so much at one time. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=109.8s)]
*  I want to go back to Israel in a moment. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=112.28s)]
*  But you mentioned European leaders, and I know that many of them were also unnerved [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=114.72s)]
*  by President Trump calling Zelensky a dictator. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal this morning writes a U.S. president's pivot to Russia. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=123.6s)]
*  We all can agree that nobody wants to see a bully win and win more territory. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=128.2s)]
*  Can you acknowledge that Russia is the aggressor here? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=133.4s)]
*  Well, you know what? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=137.4s)]
*  Who would you rather have and go toe to toe with the likes of Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=138.8s)]
*  Xi, or who, anyone else? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=144.0s)]
*  Joe Biden or Donald Trump? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=146.48s)]
*  He's the dealmaker in chief. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=148.6s)]
*  He's the commander in chief. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=150.72s)]
*  And it's only because of his strength that we're even in this position. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=152.2s)]
*  And President Trump's own words have been that Russia invaded a neighbor under Bush, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=157.36s)]
*  under Obama, under Biden, but not him. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=162.2s)]
*  It didn't happen this first term, and he's going to bring it to an end his second term. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=165.16s)]
*  And I just laid out the framework to do that, that we are all — he has a great team around [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=169.72s)]
*  him that everybody is moving out on simultaneously from our secretary of treasury to our secretary [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=175.8s)]
*  of state to our secretary of defense and, of course, our special envoy. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=182.88s)]
*  And that's what's going on. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=187.56s)]
*  And, you know, people are welcome to bring better ideas, but all I've heard is perpetuate [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=189.60000000000002s)]
*  more war. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=195.44s)]
*  And that is — no one should be surprised that that's not what President Trump campaigned [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=196.96s)]
*  on or intends to do. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=201.68s)]
*  Well, look, let me move on to the conflict on Israel. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=203.16000000000003s)]
*  And of course, we've been watching this week these atrocious moves by Hamas, celebrating [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=207.68s)]
*  dead hostages. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=213.96s)]
*  We've got to get your take on this, because at some point, doesn't the civilized world [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=216.68s)]
*  say enough is enough, we cannot go on like this with three hostages released here, three [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=221.28s)]
*  hostages dead released here, we don't know whose body it is. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=226.92s)]
*  Are you expecting to enter what is called phase two in this negotiation? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=231.07999999999998s)]
*  Can you even continue to negotiate with Hamas if you are supportive of Israel? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you, number one, we are working with our partners, both the Egyptians and [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=241.72s)]
*  the Qataris, to get the rest of the hostages out. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=249.04s)]
*  President Trump is committed and determined to do that. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=252.84s)]
*  He's also horrified by these scenes, by this despicable behavior. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=255.56s)]
*  And just remember, just six months ago, you had college campuses and administrators and [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=262.0s)]
*  progressives celebrating this group Hamas that is no different than ISIS, Al-Qaeda or [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=267.52s)]
*  any of the other worst terrorist organizations in the world. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=273.44s)]
*  I wouldn't look this behavior over this last week on with these children, with how these [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=276.52s)]
*  people have been released, this propaganda absolutely is affecting the prospects of negotiations. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=282.71999999999997s)]
*  We'll see how that unfolds this coming week. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=288.03999999999996s)]
*  There may be some type of continued extension of what we're doing right now. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=292.52s)]
*  Hamas needs to change and change to yesterday and how it's conducting this. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=298.52s)]
*  It's unacceptable, not just to the Israelis, but the entire world. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=305.52s)]
*  And I'll tell you, the end goal of Hamas cannot and will not be allowed to rule Gaza going [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=309.52s)]
*  forward and ever do this again is absolutely also in play. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=316.52s)]
*  Should Israel destroy Iran's nuclear buildup? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=320.52s)]
*  Well, Maria, all options are on the table there. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=328.52s)]
*  Look, I wouldn't... [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=331.52s)]
*  If Iran stepped forward tomorrow and gave the entire thing up, which they absolutely [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=332.52s)]
*  should, we would certainly entertain that. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=337.52s)]
*  But at the same time, they cannot have a nuke and all options are on the table to make sure [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=340.52s)]
*  that doesn't happen. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=345.52s)]
*  I know Egypt is hosting this emergency Arab summit on March 4th. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=346.52s)]
*  They're going to have their own ideas. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=350.52s)]
*  Do you have any expectations there in their discussions over Gaza? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=352.52s)]
*  Real quick. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=355.52s)]
*  If you don't like President Trump's ideas, which are practical and common sense, come [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=357.52s)]
*  forward with your own and that's what we're seeing happen because of his leadership. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=361.52s)]
*  National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, thank you so much for being here. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=366.52s)]
*  We so appreciate it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=370.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=371.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4qdIrW00o&t=376.52s)]
