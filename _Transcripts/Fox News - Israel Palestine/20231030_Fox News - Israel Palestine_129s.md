*  Gaza the Israelis say and you can hear that outgoing artillery as we speak the Israelis say that they hit over [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-r8dCC2AxE&t=49.56s)]

*  Completely wiped from the map many neighborhoods as the Israelis look to cordon off the northern part of Gaza [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-r8dCC2AxE&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  Their efforts here are focused on this one particular part of the strip where they say there is a tunnel system beneath Gaza [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-r8dCC2AxE&t=78.32s)]
*  And also a number of different Hamas positions now yesterday [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-r8dCC2AxE&t=84.96s)]
