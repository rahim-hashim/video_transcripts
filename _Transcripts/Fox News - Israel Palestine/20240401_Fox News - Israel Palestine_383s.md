# Mark Levin: This is a dangerous realignment
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU)
*  Joe Biden is now cutting off specific arms that Israel has requested while [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=0.0s)]
*  he's funding Iran and nobody's cutting off arms to Iran. He's funding Hamas [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=6.4s)]
*  through UNRWA. Nobody's cutting off arms to Hamas except the Israelis. Hezbollah [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=11.96s)]
*  is poised to attack Israel. So in other words Iran is pushing all its buttons [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=18.12s)]
*  while it is pursuing and developing and will achieve a nuclear weapon. Biden's [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=23.12s)]
*  not doing anything to Iran. He's not doing anything about the nuclear weapon. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=31.160000000000004s)]
*  Here at home, day after day, we have these little crystal knocks going on in our [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=34.44s)]
*  country. It's his party. It's his voters, as you said. He wants in Michigan and [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=38.400000000000006s)]
*  Minnesota and other states. He wants to bring back his voters. These Jew haters, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=44.08s)]
*  these anti-Semites who are saying these things and doing these things are his [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=48.24s)]
*  voters. Is the Democrat Party so corrupt? Is it so immoral? Is it so focused on [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=52.88s)]
*  power that country comes second, that morality comes second, that everything [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=62.32s)]
*  else comes second except raw power? Is that what's going on? Spot on. That's [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=67.16s)]
*  exactly what's happening is that they are trying to win in November and right [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=71.6s)]
*  now they have too many Democrat voters who have turned on Joe Biden. They look [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=75.36s)]
*  at approval ratings. They look at favorability ratings and they decide that [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=80.44s)]
*  the math doesn't work in some of these swing states if they don't adjust their [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=85.24s)]
*  strategy towards Israel and Iran. Like right now the President Biden and this [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  administration, they're treating Iran like Israel and Israel like Iran. President [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  Biden inherited a maximum pressure campaign on Iran that was working, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=99.47999999999999s)]
*  inherited it from President Trump. And you see people surrounding [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=104.28s)]
*  President Biden who were there surrounding President Obama just years [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=109.96s)]
*  prior and they want to put back that Obama legacy. It was not a good one to [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=114.28s)]
*  be trying to put together. It was the fatally flawed Iran nuclear deal. It was [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  the UN Security Council resolution December of 2016 essentially seeking to [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=125.16s)]
*  ethnically cleanse Judean Samaria of Jews. And then we all remember January of [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=129.94s)]
*  2017 just weeks before President Trump got sworn into office, John Kerry goes [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=135.72s)]
*  over to overseas for a 90-minute lecture of Israel. President Trump comes in, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=140.16s)]
*  Abraham cords, move the embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, recognize Israeli [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=145.8s)]
*  sovereignty over the Golan Heights, signed the Taylor Force Act into law to [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=150.04s)]
*  cut off taxpayer-funded funding towards entities that want to financially reward [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=153.64s)]
*  terror. President Biden comes into office and he's rolling so much back on the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=158.88s)]
*  policy. But what we are seeing as far as it being sped up in these recent weeks, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=163.68s)]
*  it's not just solely based on trying to put a failed legacy back together from [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  the pre-Trump days. This is about pandering to a block of the Democrat [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=173.48000000000002s)]
*  vote to stop bleeding in polling. And I think what's going to happen is that [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=179.52s)]
*  they're gonna end up with an even deeper cut in another part of their body [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=184.96s)]
*  because there are a whole lot of other people who actually do support Israel. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=189.0s)]
*  They do want a strong US-Israel relationship. They don't want to see the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=194.12s)]
*  Jewish population in this country thrown onto the bus and they do want what they [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=197.96s)]
*  know to be morally right. So this strategy, it's wrong on the merit, it's [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=202.2s)]
*  certainly wrong in the politics in my position, and I think that it is just for [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=206.4s)]
*  anyone who's pursuing power in this country, in this greatest country in the [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=212.68s)]
*  history of the world, it is worth going down and losing an election doing the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=216.88s)]
*  right thing. Unfortunately, that is not something that these Democrats are [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=221.64s)]
*  willing to do. I'd rather lose an election fighting for what's right than [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=225.32s)]
*  pandering to this block of vote, taking to the streets, using October 7th as a [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=229.4s)]
*  rallying cry towards action. I agree with that. I do think it goes a bit further. I [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=233.92s)]
*  do think that they're true believers in this administration. As you pointed out, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=238.48s)]
*  they work for Obama. These are true believers who do not believe that the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=243.04s)]
*  state of Israel is a legitimate state. These are true believers who believe [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=246.28s)]
*  that Israel is an oppressor regime, even though it only acts to defend itself. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=251.04s)]
*  They're true believers who believe the propaganda of the Muslim Brotherhood, of [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=255.72s)]
*  Hamas, of Islamic Jihad, of Iran, and they're of course true believers and that [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=261.64s)]
*  would include the Secretary of State, Mr. Blinken, that would include his former [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=267.48s)]
*  now disgraced envoy, Mr. Mali, who were giving the ship away, the store away to [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=271.96s)]
*  the Iranians as they build nuclear weapons, and they're going to get nuclear [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=277.12s)]
*  weapons funded by us. They have a military, again, that has been funded by [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=281.0s)]
*  us. President Trump threw them on their back, had his foot on their throat, and [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=286.0s)]
*  Joe Biden gave them CPR, and that does not explain the politics in our country. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=291.12s)]
*  There's something ideological going on here, and it's very dangerous. It's called [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=297.28s)]
*  the realignment. They want to realign the Middle East. They don't want Israel to [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=301.92s)]
*  be the most powerful force. They're okay with Iran getting nuclear weapons to [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=306.6s)]
*  create a balance. They believe that Israel should be carved up. That's an [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=310.52000000000004s)]
*  illegitimate state. This is what Obama believes. This is what the Marxists [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=314.64000000000004s)]
*  believe. This is what the radicals and the Democrat Party believe. So yes, it's [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=319.12s)]
*  for power, but it's also because they hate the state of Israel. We have to [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=323.44s)]
*  accept that fact, and Joe Biden is part of it. Joe Biden is leading it. Whether [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=329.32s)]
*  he's got three brain cells or not, it doesn't much matter. It's through him and [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=334.04s)]
*  his office that they're doing it, and he's the one responsible for it. And the [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=337.68s)]
*  fact that he won't open his mouth to condemn his voters about what they're [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=342.71999999999997s)]
*  saying in the streets, what they're promoting in the streets, what they're [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=348.08s)]
*  doing on our college campuses, what they're doing in Hollywood, since [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=351.64s)]
*  everything we need to know about Joe Biden was a racist segregationist early [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=355.04s)]
*  in his career. And today, as history will point out, in my view, he's an [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=359.48s)]
*  anti-Semite. Congressman, I want to thank you very much. Lee Zeldin, you're a good [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=364.28000000000003s)]
*  man. God bless you, brother. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKaM7GeknU&t=369.0s)]
