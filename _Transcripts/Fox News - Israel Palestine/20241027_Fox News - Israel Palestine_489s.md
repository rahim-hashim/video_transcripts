# GOP rep says Trump learned this ‘very good’ lesson while in office
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE)
*  And we begin this Sunday morning with the war on Israel and its retaliation against [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=0.0s)]
*  Iran as Israel launched waves of attacks on Iran over several hours on Saturday morning [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  in what the Wall Street Journal called the most serious attack on Iran in decades, even [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=12.64s)]
*  if measured enough to avoid escalation. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=17.64s)]
*  Israel did not hit Iran's nuclear or oil facilities, which Iran has warned for weeks would prompt [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=20.96s)]
*  an aggressive response. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  Instead, dozens of warplanes from Israel hitting several military targets across Iran, including [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=28.0s)]
*  ballistic missile production facilities and surface-to-air missile defense sites. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=33.84s)]
*  All of this in response to Iran's barrage of some 200 missiles on Israel back on October [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=39.04s)]
*  1st for the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah late last month. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=43.76s)]
*  U.S. officials said that they were aware of Israel's retaliation despite the earlier leak [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  of highly classified U.S. documents, which showed Israel's military plans against Iran. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=53.52s)]
*  It prompted an investigation by the Defense Department and the FBI over who posted the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  top secret documents to social media, putting Israel's security in jeopardy. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=63.64s)]
*  Here's former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe with me this past week on Fox [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=69.36s)]
*  Business. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=72.92s)]
*  It's a betrayal of trust between the United States and Israel that has come from a Biden-Harris [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=73.92s)]
*  administration that has betrayed that trust time and time again. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=80.32s)]
*  The problem here is now the Israelis are wondering whether it's really not that at all, whether [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=83.92s)]
*  it's that this is all intentional. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=88.6s)]
*  Joining me now in this Sunday Morning Futures exclusive is the chairman of the House Intelligence [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  Committee, Congressman Mike Turner from Ohio. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=95.39999999999999s)]
*  Congressman, great to see you this morning. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=98.08s)]
*  Thank you so much for being here. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=100.32s)]
*  Morning, Bre. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=101.32s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=102.32s)]
*  Your reaction to Israel's retaliation against Iran, where does this warhead next? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=103.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=108.6s)]
*  Well, one of the fallacies of the Biden administration, Maria, is that the United States has rightly [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=109.6s)]
*  assisted Israel in defending against the missile attacks from Iran with missile defense. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=114.44s)]
*  There are over several hundred missiles that Iran has launched against Israel. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=120.28s)]
*  And the Biden administration has attempted to act like, well, since those missiles didn't [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=125.12s)]
*  hit their intended targets as if they didn't happen, then trying to restrain Israel's response. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=128.16s)]
*  In doing so, they've limited the ability for Israel to really impact Iran and its ability [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=134.36s)]
*  to continue to threaten Israel. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=139.76s)]
*  This certainly makes it very difficult as Israel goes forward. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=142.20000000000002s)]
*  But Israel rightly is defending itself. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=144.8s)]
*  It is hitting military targets. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=146.6s)]
*  It is trying to diminish Iran's overall capabilities to hit and affect Israel. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=148.28s)]
*  And Iran's capabilities are in fact being diminished as Israel takes the conflict to [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=154.84s)]
*  it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=160.12s)]
*  Do you expect a response from Iran after this weekend's attack from Israel? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=161.12s)]
*  I think Iran will continue to respond, but Iran has continued to attack Israel. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=167.04s)]
*  I mean, it's kind of hard to determine what really is a response from Iran and what is [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=170.96s)]
*  just its continuing attacks. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=175.4s)]
*  Part of the other problems with the Biden administration is they've continued to look [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=177.4s)]
*  at this as just a regional conflict rather than just the continuation of Iran's efforts [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=180.16s)]
*  to continue to attack Israel, to challenge its right to exist with its proxies, Hezbollah [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  and Hamas, and now Iran's direct attacks on Israel itself. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=191.64000000000001s)]
*  Tell me about this leak. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=196.92000000000002s)]
*  How is it possible that Israel's military plans against Iran get leaked on social media? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=198.32s)]
*  Well, Maria, this is, as you were indicating, and certainly with John Radcliffe's statements, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=204.8s)]
*  the administration did not indicate that they were trying to investigate whether or not [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=211.44s)]
*  this was a leak or whether or not this was a hack, openly identifying that it was their [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=215.32s)]
*  assumption that this had been a leak, which as you were discussing with John Radcliffe, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=220.0s)]
*  means that this would be an act of sabotage. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=224.72s)]
*  The FBI is looking at this as a criminal act of espionage, and that certainly is what it [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=227.28s)]
*  is. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=233.84s)]
*  It certainly has an impact on both the United States itself. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=234.84s)]
*  We have service members who are in the area and also Israel itself. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=238.24s)]
*  Do you think Israel is hoping for Trump victory to finish this war? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=243.44s)]
*  One thing's for certain, really for all of our allies, to be free of the Biden administration's [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=249.12s)]
*  restrictions, to be able to defend yourself openly when you're attacked by an adversary, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=254.64s)]
*  but also to understand that there's coordination here. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=260.32s)]
*  The access of evil, what's going on between Iran and China and Russia, all of the coordinations [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=263.04s)]
*  really does bear coordination from us. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=268.96s)]
*  What happens with Iran's oil fields fuels China's economy. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=272.4s)]
*  What happens in Iran's missile fields shows up on the battlefields in Ukraine. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=276.59999999999997s)]
*  All of this needs to be addressed as if this is not regional conflicts, but a coordinated [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=283.23999999999995s)]
*  conflict and that our allies have an ability to fully and completely defend themselves, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=287.2s)]
*  not just have minor responses to what really is very broad provocations from our adversaries. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=292.35999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I guess what I'm asking you is, we have seen zero deterrence from the Biden-Harris [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=298.4s)]
*  administration on Iran. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=303.2s)]
*  Iran hacked into the Trump campaign. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=305.23999999999995s)]
*  Iran has had targets on Trump's back, on Mike Pompeo's back, outwardly saying we want to [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=307.2s)]
*  assassinate Donald Trump. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=313.15999999999997s)]
*  There's been no response from the Biden-Harris administration. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=314.71999999999997s)]
*  Do you believe Israel wants Trump to win? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=318.29999999999995s)]
*  Well, I think absolutely. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=321.12s)]
*  As former President Trump has said, I don't think these conflicts would have happened [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=324.04s)]
*  under President Trump because you wouldn't, you would have had the assumption from these [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=329.0s)]
*  adversaries that there would have been consequences. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=333.36s)]
*  The day that if he's elected and raises his hand, people are going to understand that [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=335.92s)]
*  there are consequences to adversaries. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=340.2s)]
*  They're not going to have the ability to do these skirmishes, these attacks without real [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=342.72s)]
*  and significant consequences. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=348.64s)]
*  That's the only way that you end these conflicts, is if people paying a price for attacking [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=350.56s)]
*  and killing our allies. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=355.4s)]
*  So what has Harris and Biden done in that regard then? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=357.68s)]
*  Well, you know, you were discussing, you know, Vice President Harris even hasn't even embraced [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=361.4s)]
*  fully President Biden's policy, which even though it's lukewarm, still fully supports [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=366.28000000000003s)]
*  Israel. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=372.52s)]
*  He gives them very tepid ability to defend themselves, but fully supports Israel. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=373.52s)]
*  She's been lukewarm on whether or not in responding, whether or not she fully supports Israel. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=378.96000000000004s)]
*  So we don't even know if there'd be a step back from the lukewarm support that the Biden [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=383.44s)]
*  administration has been giving. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=387.68s)]
*  But as you were just indicated, you know, here the Biden administration really had an [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=389.28000000000003s)]
*  opportunity to step up the plate here. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=394.0s)]
*  Iran not only is attacking Israel, but they have openly indicated they want to kill former [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=395.40000000000003s)]
*  President Trump, now a candidate for president again. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=401.76s)]
*  President Biden indicated this after being prodded that this would be an act of war. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=405.72s)]
*  This would have been an opportunity to take consequences to Iran for them threatening [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=409.84000000000003s)]
*  President Trump and for attacking Israel. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=414.44000000000005s)]
*  And instead, President Biden heeds caution. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=416.6s)]
*  Do you believe that the intelligence community will get behind Trump in a real way, a meaningful [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=420.64000000000004s)]
*  way? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=425.64000000000004s)]
*  Should he win this? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=426.64000000000004s)]
*  Unlike last time? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=428.6s)]
*  Well, I think that President Trump learned some some very good lessons. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=429.6s)]
*  One of them that is he needs to put behind him very strong people and clear out significant [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=435.08000000000004s)]
*  levels of each of these agencies. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=440.68s)]
*  So he has people who are responsive. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=442.96000000000004s)]
*  So he doesn't have people who are working against him. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=444.64000000000004s)]
*  But for the intelligence community, there is a sense of arrogance, of unwillingness [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0hQH7z6jE&t=447.32000000000005s)]
