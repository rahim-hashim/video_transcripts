# Three sets of mother-daughters freed in Hamas hostage release
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c)
*  The International Red Cross confirms 24 hostages have now been released by Hamas from Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=0.0s)]
*  That includes 13 Israelis plus several Thai citizens and one Filipino creed under a separate [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=6.42s)]
*  deal brokered by Qatari officials. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=12.02s)]
*  Alex Hogan is at Schneider Children's Medical Center near Tel Aviv, Israel with the latest. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=14.98s)]
*  Alex? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=19.82s)]
*  Hi, Kaylee. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=20.82s)]
*  So we're able to see these live images coming in of the hostages in buses heading toward [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=21.82s)]
*  the air base there. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=27.78s)]
*  We will receive medical support, speak to doctors and psychologists before individually [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=28.78s)]
*  they are sent to different medical centers. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=34.42s)]
*  And this one behind me is the Children's Hospital near Tel Aviv. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=36.620000000000005s)]
*  And now that we officially have confirmation that there are four children who have been [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=40.24s)]
*  freed in this deal just in the last hour or so, we have that official word of who they [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=44.42s)]
*  are. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=49.46s)]
*  We expect that we will see them here today. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=50.46s)]
*  And it's worth noting just the remarkable stories that we have heard in the weeks out [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=52.02s)]
*  these people are and their loved ones who have been begging for their release. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=57.18s)]
*  So one of the groups, the family is two little girls, a sister, two year old and a four year [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=61.46s)]
*  old. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=68.26s)]
*  They have been released along with their mother and we have heard the father of this family [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=69.26s)]
*  repeatedly demand for the release of his wife and his two little girls. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=74.06s)]
*  So he is one of the very lucky few families who tonight will be reunited back with his [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=77.38s)]
*  daughters and his wife again. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=82.66s)]
*  Altogether there are three sets of mothers and daughters. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=84.82s)]
*  That is an amazing, amazing bit of news that we have just learned here on the ground because [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=87.82s)]
*  that has been one of the goals that the Israeli government had demanded was asking for the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=91.9s)]
*  families, mothers and daughters to be released together and the mothers and sons, I should [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=96.38s)]
*  say. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=100.3s)]
*  So two little girls, sisters released together, another little girl, five years old and a [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=101.3s)]
*  little boy, nine years old. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=105.8s)]
*  We can actually hear some cheering from the streets here. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=107.34s)]
*  People are celebrating here tonight in Tel Aviv. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=110.98s)]
*  It is a moment of celebration. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=113.22s)]
*  There's also a lot of caution and fear to celebrate too soon for those who have not [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=115.05999999999999s)]
*  yet received word on their loved ones. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=120.14s)]
*  But this is just night one of this ceasefire broker deal to bring more hostages home, more [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=122.14s)]
*  ahead in the next three days. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=128.26s)]
*  Kayleigh, so we will wait on that. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=129.78s)]
*  Alex, you know, Roz and Aviv Asher are the two little girls you're referring to and their [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=131.26s)]
*  mother released now to be home with their dad, Yoni. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=136.18s)]
*  That's great, great news for that family. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=140.66s)]
*  You mentioned earlier today that the preparations the Israeli government has been undergoing [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=143.22s)]
*  for these children and their arrival, they actually consulted with Holocaust survivors [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=148.5s)]
*  to know exactly the best and most appropriate way to welcome home these children. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=153.22s)]
*  Can you take us into their thinking and their level of preparation? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=158.1s)]
*  Yeah, unfortunately, that's something that they had to do. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=161.38s)]
*  But given the really dire conditions that we realize, these hostages likely have been [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=165.62s)]
*  living in in the last seven weeks, the government here consulted with the Holocaust survivors [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=170.22s)]
*  who are still alive here in Israel, talking to them about what it was like for them when [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  they were released from the Holocaust, about what the traumas were for them, what the triggers [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=179.62s)]
*  were for them and how the government today could make this transition as seamless as [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=184.56s)]
*  possible and as painless as possible given through how much people have already been [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=189.14s)]
*  through. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=193.98s)]
*  And some of these children we are learning will be coming home to find out that they [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=194.98s)]
*  no longer have families, not these specific children, but the children that could be part [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=198.85999999999999s)]
*  of this group of 50 because the soldiers have been told not to give them any specific details [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=203.5s)]
*  about their family. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=208.01999999999998s)]
*  If these children do ask, that should be done in a more safe environment. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=209.3s)]
*  So a lot of consultations with with different members of the community here and in having [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=213.48s)]
*  to speak with Holocaust survivors about what it was like for them, knowing that there are [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=218.6s)]
*  also hostages right now who were in the Holocaust as well. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=222.9s)]
*  So it's just an incredibly traumatic time tonight. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=227.26s)]
*  Millions of people are glued to the TV screens in their homes waiting to have a little bit [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=230.22s)]
*  more word, more answers, more clarity about what is all unfolding in front of us in this [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=234.86s)]
*  moment. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=239.54s)]
*  Kaylee. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=240.54s)]
*  Alex, thank you very much. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=241.54s)]
*  You know, Kara, one component of this is first and foremost, it's taking care of these kids, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=243.57999999999998s)]
*  reuniting them with their families, making sure they're OK physically, mentally. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=248.62s)]
*  Another component of what's going to play out is debriefing, is trying to gather intelligence [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=253.18s)]
*  because every second counts for the remaining families. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=257.94s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=261.26s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly right. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=262.26s)]
*  I was an intelligence officer for almost a decade, and it's critical to get those pieces [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=263.58s)]
*  of information so that you can help the other hostages going forward. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=268.12s)]
*  You know, Israel has some very elite units who specialize in these kinds of things. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=271.74s)]
*  So hopefully that sort of intel any debrief that they'll get actual good nuggets, good [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=275.66s)]
*  data points for those soldiers, those operators to then go in and prevent more hostages from [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=281.02000000000004s)]
*  losing their lives. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=286.3s)]
*  We know hostages have died in Hamas custody as well. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=287.3s)]
*  So hopefully those debriefs offer a treasure trove of valuable intelligence. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=290.70000000000005s)]
*  Tammy. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=295.58000000000004s)]
*  Well, with the Holocaust survivors, there aren't many left. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=296.58000000000004s)]
*  It was 78 years ago that the World War II ended. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=300.22s)]
*  If you were going to have survived the Holocaust, likely you did so as a child. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=304.02000000000004s)]
*  So the people working now with children understand that likely if they were under 18 or under [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=308.94s)]
*  10 years old, knowing what their lives were like in the future and what developed and [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=313.78s)]
*  what came to be as Israel, they have a special understanding of what those individuals, all [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=318.76s)]
*  of them, especially the women, but certainly the children, are going to have to expect [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=324.1s)]
*  for the next, for the rest of their lives, really. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=328.06s)]
*  Yeah, for the rest of their lives. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6A1q-4ph3c&t=330.38s)]
