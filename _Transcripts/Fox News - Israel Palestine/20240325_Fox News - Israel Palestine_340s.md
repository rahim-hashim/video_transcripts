# VP Harris refuses to rule out 'consequences' for Israel
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [March 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4)
*  We got more breaking news because we're coming up on six months on this war in Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=0.0s)]
*  We're going to show you right now about the activity that's happening on the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=3.68s)]
*  This is where the Al-Shifa Hospital was in Gaza City. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=7.88s)]
*  Well, it still is. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=10.28s)]
*  There's an ongoing battle again there to try and isolate what the IDF says the Israeli [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=11.44s)]
*  Defense Forces say are more Hamas fighters taking refuge inside. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=15.76s)]
*  To the southern end of the Strip is Yaffa, as Rafa rather, the town of Rafa, which is [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=20.36s)]
*  a border crossing. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=24.68s)]
*  The Egyptians closed it on one side. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=25.72s)]
*  The Israelis have it surrounded. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=28.0s)]
*  The question is whether or not the IDF makes a move on Rafa. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=29.6s)]
*  You know what the administration's been saying? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=33.08s)]
*  Don't go. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=35.64s)]
*  Don't do it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=36.64s)]
*  I advance it one time just to show you that these is where the Israeli ground operation [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=37.64s)]
*  had taken place for the last five and a half months. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=41.44s)]
*  Here in the north, a little bit in the south around Khan Yunis, you see the evacuation [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=44.28s)]
*  zones. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=48.2s)]
*  A bit hard to see on this map. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=49.2s)]
*  They're located here right along the Israeli border. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=50.2s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Vice President Kamala Harris trying to crank up the pressure on Benjamin [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=53.36s)]
*  Netanyahu. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=57.52s)]
*  She asked about it this weekend and said this about the war. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=58.52s)]
*  We've been very clear that it would be a mistake to move into Rafa with any type of military [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=63.28s)]
*  operation. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=69.64s)]
*  A mistake, but would there be consequences if he does move forward? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=70.64s)]
*  Well, we're going to take it one step at a time, but we've been very clear in terms of [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=74.64s)]
*  our perspective on whether or not that should happen. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=78.0s)]
*  Are you ruling out that there would be consequences from the United States? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=80.32000000000001s)]
*  I am ruling out nothing. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=83.92s)]
*  Here with us now Dan Sinor, author of the book The Genius of Israel, a former Bush administration [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=86.36s)]
*  advisor. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=90.0s)]
*  He also has a podcast called Call Me Back. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=91.0s)]
*  I listened to it this morning and I always learn a lot from it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=92.0s)]
*  This, I don't know what you think about Kamala Harris' comments, but they are ratcheting [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=95.0s)]
*  this pressure up from the White House every day. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=100.56s)]
*  I think they know that Israel is going into Rafa. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=102.6s)]
*  I was in Israel last week. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=105.6s)]
*  I met with Ron Dermer, who's a minister in the war cabinet. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=107.84s)]
*  I interviewed him for my podcast and he basically laid out in our conversation that Israel and [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=112.44000000000001s)]
*  the Israeli public, there's a broad consensus from right to left that they have to finish [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=118.80000000000001s)]
*  this war, they have to finish off Hamas and they can't do that if they don't go into [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=122.76s)]
*  Rafa. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=126.36000000000001s)]
*  Some of the Hamas leadership is in Rafa, four of the remaining battalions are in Rafa. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=127.36000000000001s)]
*  To not go into Rafa is to not finish the war. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=131.28s)]
*  The administration is trying to shape how Israel deals with the humanitarian implications [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=134.0s)]
*  of that, moving some of the civilians up to North Gaza. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=138.16s)]
*  So that's why they're trying to slow them down and make no mistake about it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=141.18s)]
*  What you're hearing in Kamala Harris, what you've heard in Joe Biden, what you've heard [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=143.9s)]
*  in Chuck Schumer, is an attempt to try to mollify unsupportive language from the progressive [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=146.34s)]
*  left in their own political coalition, the US, by at least projecting that they're beating [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=153.38s)]
*  up on Israel and trying to restrain them. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=158.18s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=159.66s)]
*  They're going to do what the question is when. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=160.66s)]
*  What could delay them, however, is maybe some sort of hostage swap, which apparently may [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=162.72s)]
*  or may not be in the works right now. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=167.18s)]
*  Last week, Dan and I were speaking with a spokesperson from Netanyahu's office. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=169.18s)]
*  He says there are 99 hostages still in Gaza today. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=172.1s)]
*  Meanwhile, you got the story of Moscow over the weekend. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=175.46s)]
*  You heard Marco Rubio a bit earlier today on our broadcast. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=177.86s)]
*  Tom Cotton's talking the same way about the growing ISIS threat that's coming out of Afghanistan [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=180.74s)]
*  and our southern border. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=185.8s)]
*  Watch. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=187.38s)]
*  I asked our commanding general in the Middle East about ISIS's capacity to project attacks [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=188.38s)]
*  from Afghanistan. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=194.58s)]
*  He said that in as little as six months and turned out to be closer to six days that ISIS [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=195.58s)]
*  from Afghanistan, with little or no warning, could attack Western interests across Asia [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=200.54000000000002s)]
*  and Europe. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=205.34s)]
*  And that's exactly what we've seen happen. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=206.34s)]
*  This is a very dangerous echo of President Biden's failed withdrawal from Afghanistan. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=207.82000000000002s)]
*  So over the weekend on Sunday, the French government put their own people on notice. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=213.06s)]
*  Where do you think this is going now, Dan? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=216.42000000000002s)]
*  I think that I think Senator Cotton is right that there is a threat from Afghanistan that [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=217.94s)]
*  we don't have much growing threat from ISIS that we don't have much visibility into. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=223.78s)]
*  ISIS is all over the Middle East too. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=227.94s)]
*  Particularly they have been historically in Syria and Iraq. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=229.82s)]
*  The U.S. and U.S.-led forces did a lot to extinguish them out of the region. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=232.54s)]
*  But we have to still be present in the Middle East and our allies in the Middle East, whether [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=237.85999999999999s)]
*  it's Israel or Saudi Arabia, matter a lot. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=241.94s)]
*  They are the forces that are not only, as we're seeing right now in Israel's war with [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=244.73999999999998s)]
*  Hamas, which is basically a satellite organization of ISIS, are on the front lines of fighting [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=247.78s)]
*  these terrorists. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=252.79999999999998s)]
*  But our allies in the region we depend on for intelligence gathering. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=253.79999999999998s)]
*  So deepening ties with our allies in the region is important to American security, particularly [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=257.12s)]
*  when there are terrorist organizations like ISIS on the rise. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=261.44s)]
*  Can I ask you a quick question? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=263.68s)]
*  The terrorists who the Russians arrested, they said they got paid, that they got half [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=267.15999999999997s)]
*  the money up front. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=272.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=273.64s)]
*  If you follow the money, where does that take you? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=274.64s)]
*  I mean, could it be Iran-backed? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=276.44s)]
*  I don't, I mean, it could be. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=278.15999999999997s)]
*  It certainly could be. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=282.24s)]
*  They were, so ISIS was fighting Syria. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  Syria is a proxy of Iran, so it's not entirely clear where the money came from. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=288.2s)]
*  The truth is, this money, they don't require enormous resources. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=294.64s)]
*  These are not complicated attacks to pull off, which is probably what makes them so [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=297.76s)]
*  scary. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=301.52s)]
*  What they need is a- [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=302.52s)]
*  And scary here, to that point. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=303.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=304.52s)]
*  Yeah, they need a base of operations from which to operate and organize. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=305.52s)]
*  They don't need a lot of money. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=307.48s)]
*  And that's what's worrisome about vacuums in places like Afghanistan or vacuums in places [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=309.48s)]
*  like the Middle East, where they have a place to hunker down, headquarter, get organized, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=312.68s)]
*  train, logistics, get arms, that's, but it's, I don't think these are costly affairs. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=318.04s)]
*  It is terror on the cheap. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=323.8s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=325.08000000000004s)]
*  And it is largely effective. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=326.08000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qNOf9L0q4&t=327.08000000000004s)]
