# Netanyahu adviser: Not confident Americans held by Hamas are alive
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8)
*  John Kirby watch we think the number obviously says somewhere in the neighborhood of eight to nine probably more like nine [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=0.0s)]
*  We know that there's at least one other [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=6.3s)]
*  American woman who's unaccounted for we don't know much about her her condition where she is and I would say the same thing [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=8.8s)]
*  Unfortunately about the other Americans that are being held hostage [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=14.8s)]
*  Hamas is the reason that the that the pause ended because they refused to put on the list additional women and children that we know [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=17.56s)]
*  They that they are holding and they're refusing to let go so that from Fox News Sunday with Shannon Breen [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=24.18s)]
*  Fighting resumed over the weekend Israeli Prime Minister. Mr. Netanyahu saying that the war will continue until Israel achieves all of its aims [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=29.419999999999998s)]
*  Mark Reggev is a senior adviser the Israeli leader is with me now and sir [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=37.019999999999996s)]
*  Thank you for coming back here to our program eight or nine. Yeah eight or nine Americans [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=40.82s)]
*  Where are they now in Gaza? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=46.379999999999995s)]
*  So in some dungeon that Hamas is controlling and one has to fear for them [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=51.34s)]
*  Because as you know with the help of the United States of America Israel managed to achieve a pause where our [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=56.699999999999996s)]
*  Some of our hostages were released altogether [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=63.82s)]
*  sizable number [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=67.62s)]
*  Over a 100 were released 80 of them Israeli nationals. That's a good thing [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=69.42s)]
*  But we've still got a about 130 being held including the Americans and we have to fear for them because we've been [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=74.14s)]
*  Interviewing the people have come out and they went through a living hell [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=81.16s)]
*  I heard just a moment ago from the Children's Hospital a director of the Children's Hospital where some of the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=83.96s)]
*  Children who've been going, you know who released and the sort of things they had to go through [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  No child should ever have to go through the way Hamas treated them. No [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=95.96s)]
*  This are you confident that these Americans are still alive [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=101.24s)]
*  Look I can't be confident that anyone is alive. Unfortunately, we're dealing with a brutal [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=106.11999999999999s)]
*  Terrorist group that has no qualms whatsoever about butchering people. We saw that on October 7th [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=111.19999999999999s)]
*  When they entered Israel and they massacred our people and no raped burned people alive [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=117.0s)]
*  terrible terrible crimes against humanity and [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=122.91999999999999s)]
*  We see that with the way they treat their own people the Palestinian people of Gaza how they deliberately use them as cannon fodder [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=125.8s)]
*  Deliberately use them as cannon fodder how they deliberately use them as a human shield for their terror war machine [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=131.48000000000002s)]
*  Why else do you build your bunkers and hospitals? Why else do you store missiles in schools? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=137.16s)]
*  Why else do you build your underground underground tunnels under urban? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=142.76s)]
*  neighborhoods the idea is to have [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=147.44s)]
*  The civilian population of Gaza as a human shield for your war machine. There's no other explanation [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=150.04000000000002s)]
*  So these are brutal people and anyone who's in there, you know held by them. We have to fear for them [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=155.36s)]
*  Yeah, your negotiators were pulled out of Qatar over the weekend [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=160.85999999999999s)]
*  I'm assuming there is still a line of communication with Hamas leadership. Can you confirm that? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=165.01999999999998s)]
*  Look I can confirm the following that [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=172.18s)]
*  We believe very strongly that Hamas aren't suddenly gonna change their their behavior and become humanitarians [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=175.26s)]
*  They will only release more hostages if they fell feel compelled to do so and [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=181.78s)]
*  By applying military pressure and beefing up the strikes of the Israeli Defense Forces against Hamas's military machine [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=188.01999999999998s)]
*  Eliminating their commanders when they start to feel the pain [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=195.33999999999997s)]
*  Maybe then we'll have another opportunity to get our people out. Well last question [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=199.1s)]
*  Will there be a ground invasion in southern Gaza? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=203.98s)]
*  Yes, we have no alternative [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=209.94s)]
*  Ultimately Hamas has key [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=213.5s)]
*  Infrastructure there in the south they have their [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=216.18s)]
*  major central commanders there in the south what we have done is of course we've we've told the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=219.70000000000002s)]
*  Civilian population where we expect there to be heavy fighting. We've asked them to relocate [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=226.70000000000002s)]
*  We don't want to see civilians caught up in the crossfire [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=231.54000000000002s)]
*  But Hamas has to know that we're coming after them [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=233.9s)]
*  We will reach them and they will pay a price for their butchering of Israeli civilians and we'll get rid of them [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=237.18s)]
*  They will no longer run the Gaza Strip when this is over and that'll be good for Israel for obvious reasons [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=243.78s)]
*  But that's ultimately also good for the people of Gaza who deserve a better government [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=248.54s)]
*  Hamas has been ruling there for 16 years and what have they bought the people of Gaza pain suffering bloodshed and poverty [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=252.78s)]
*  It's not a particularly [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=259.98s)]
*  impressive [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=262.02s)]
*  Success level and now war mark Redgev. Thank you for your time today. We'll speak again very soon. Thank you, sir [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqVpqhuktz8&t=263.46s)]
