# This is not a ‘risk-free policy’: Israel Consul General Aviv Ezra
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg)
*  Families remaining cautiously optimistic about the Israel Hamas ceasefire deal that will [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=0.0s)]
*  free 50 women and children held hostage by Hamas. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=6.58s)]
*  Included in this deal, in this pause, is the release of three Americans. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=10.4s)]
*  Want to bring in Israeli Consul General Aviv Ezra. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=14.36s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=17.48s)]
*  And I'm sorry for what you're going through. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=18.48s)]
*  If this is a deal, when will we start to see some hostages being released? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=22.16s)]
*  So first of all, thank you for having me and happy early Thanksgiving. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=27.68s)]
*  You know, we're very thankful, devastated by what happened October 7th with Hamas attacking, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=30.36s)]
*  butchering our people, raping and executing elderly women and children. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=36.2s)]
*  Now we are thankful for the opportunity to really move forward to try to release some [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  of our hostages. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=47.76s)]
*  This is another war crime that Hamas has actually conducted. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=48.76s)]
*  They have brought over into Gaza elderly women, children, another war crime by taking these [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=52.56s)]
*  babies 10-month-old, 2-years-old, 4-years-old, 6-years-old. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  And this is not a prisoner exchange. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=64.12s)]
*  This is Hamas once again trading, dealing not only with bodies, but this time with babies. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=66.5s)]
*  We look forward that this will happen sooner rather than later. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=73.32000000000001s)]
*  We hope that it will happen by the end of this week. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=75.66s)]
*  As you said, as you mentioned, the families are devastated. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=78.72s)]
*  Hamas is emotionally blackmailing both Israel through the families, but we're looking forward [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=82.8s)]
*  to be able to create this mechanism of which we could answer one of two of the goals that [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=89.0s)]
*  we had during this campaign. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=94.76s)]
*  One is to totally eradicate Hamas' capabilities to hurt us again, but the second, of course, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=96.76s)]
*  is to bring back our babies, our women, our elderly and our men. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=101.64s)]
*  So I asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former Secretary of State, about the fact [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=105.24s)]
*  that once this pause starts, you can imagine that the calls for a permanency's fire are [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=109.14s)]
*  going to increase from some people who want Israel to back off. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=114.6s)]
*  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said this. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=119.0s)]
*  Watch here. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  Make no mistake about it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=121.47999999999999s)]
*  The Israelis must continue their effort. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=124.0s)]
*  The reason these hostages are coming home, if they do, the reason they will be returned [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=126.32s)]
*  to their families is because of the enormously good work the Israelis have done to put pressure [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=130.44s)]
*  on Hamas' leadership over the past six-plus weeks. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=134.32s)]
*  How do you manage the communications to the world that, yes, you are going to do this [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=137.92s)]
*  pause, we're going to see if this works, you will still have hostages remaining, but there [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=142.84s)]
*  are innocent Palestinians caught in Gaza. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=148.28s)]
*  Again, Hamas leaves them there, but the calls for this ceasefire are going to increase. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=151.64s)]
*  How will you handle it? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=157.84s)]
*  Well, first of all, the Secretary is 100 percent right, Secretary Pompeo. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=158.84s)]
*  The reason that Hamas is even willing to move forward to any exchange is due to the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=162.56s)]
*  fact that we executed military pressure over there. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  So at the beginning of the campaign, when we were outside, they were not even willing [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=170.72s)]
*  to talk to us. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=174.04s)]
*  They said at this point you have to wait. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=175.04s)]
*  And when we came in, we executed this military pressure, they came up with this offer. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=176.28s)]
*  Second, we know that this is not a risk-free policy. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=182.24s)]
*  The fact that we are now pausing for four days is not because Hamas is now going to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=185.28s)]
*  develop Gaza during those four days. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=190.68s)]
*  They are going to rearm, regroup, and they will pose additional threat towards our military [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=193.39999999999998s)]
*  that is in northern part of Gaza. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=200.32s)]
*  However, this is an utmost goal of ours to make sure that the hostages come back sooner [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=202.32s)]
*  rather than later, and this is what we're going to be focusing on in comparison. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=209.88s)]
*  American families are going to be gathering tomorrow for Thanksgiving. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=214.23999999999998s)]
*  What would you ask us to pray for? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=218.44s)]
*  This war is not between Israel and Hamas. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=222.55999999999997s)]
*  This war is between Israel and Iran's proxies, Hamas, Hezbollah, Houthis, all around Syria. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=226.04s)]
*  This is a war between humanity and barbarism, between good and evil. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=233.39999999999998s)]
*  We know that America is in the hostages, and we know that American interests are being [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=237.95999999999998s)]
*  invested in supporting Israel. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=241.64s)]
*  We're very grateful both to America as a whole, executive and legislative branch, for [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  supporting Israel. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=247.2s)]
*  What I think we should wish for in this Thanksgiving is actually to make sure that the right side [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=248.2s)]
*  of history prevails, that we will have also our Hanukkah coming up very soon, that light [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=255.16s)]
*  will prevail over darkness, that good will prevail over evil, and God willing we will [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=262.2s)]
*  make sure that this happens sooner rather than later. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=266.96s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=269.15999999999997s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1q8nO-39Jg&t=270.15999999999997s)]
