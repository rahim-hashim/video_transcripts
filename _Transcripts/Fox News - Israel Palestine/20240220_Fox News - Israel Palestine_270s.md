# Biden accused of betraying Israel with stance on cease-fire
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [February 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8)
*  The secretary has a lot of serious business on his schedule as well. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=0.0s)]
*  Today the U.S. will formally call on the United Nations to push for a temporary ceasefire [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=4.32s)]
*  in Gaza ahead of the Security Council's vote. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=8.56s)]
*  Their proposed draft to the U.N. says in part, under current circumstances, a major ground [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=11.94s)]
*  offensive in Tarrafa would result in further harm to civilians and their further displacement, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=17.6s)]
*  including potentially into neighboring countries. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=23.84s)]
*  Michael Allen is former assistant for national security to President Bush, and he joins [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=26.88s)]
*  me now. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=32.16s)]
*  Michael, good morning to you. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=33.16s)]
*  It's great to see you. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=34.16s)]
*  What do you think about this U.N. resolution, this push to call for a ceasefire? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=35.16s)]
*  This is a U.N. thing, so it doesn't hold any real weight. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=39.84s)]
*  It's more where the United States stands. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=43.0s)]
*  But still, the United States' opinion does matter here, and I don't think Israel would [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  agree with this. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=49.86s)]
*  Yeah, here we have Israel fighting terrorists and an existential threat, and I took it as [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=51.8s)]
*  the Biden administration shooting Israel in the back. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=58.04s)]
*  Israel needs more time to deal with this terrorist force. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=61.959999999999994s)]
*  I understand we have grave concerns about the humanitarian situation, so let's continue [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  to press for assistance and aid to get through. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  We wouldn't have been dictated to, after 9-11, in Afghanistan, if the world community [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=75.96s)]
*  was standing up and saying, hey, you know what, America, back down against Al-Qaeda. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=82.0s)]
*  By the same token, Israel ought to be given more time and space to finish the job in Gaza, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=86.8s)]
*  and then we can help them pull back. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=92.88s)]
*  Yeah, there's also a report, Michael, that the U.S. is working on a peace deal that includes [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  a firm timeline for a Palestinian state. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=99.1s)]
*  This would be perceived as being a reward for killing 1,200 Israelis, and there's [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=103.12s)]
*  no way a Republican administration would ever entertain an idea like this. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=108.16s)]
*  But also, practically, what would a firm timeline for a Palestinian state look like? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=112.4s)]
*  It would cause a headlong rush to try and make this work when the conditions are not [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=118.03999999999999s)]
*  set for that on the ground. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=123.36s)]
*  First of all, it's premature, because it would seemingly reward the Palestinians for [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=125.28s)]
*  Hamas's dastardly actions. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=130.72s)]
*  But second, I don't think we've done any of the hard work. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=133.6s)]
*  Who is going to rule a Palestinian state? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=136.64s)]
*  Just what territory is going to be at play? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=139.2s)]
*  And will they control their own borders and national security, so to speak, or will they [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=143.79999999999998s)]
*  let more terrorists and Iranian proxies into a new Palestinian area? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=148.0s)]
*  So I'm worried about it. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=154.5s)]
*  I don't think it makes sense. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=155.76s)]
*  I think we have a long way to go before we get there. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=157.11999999999998s)]
*  We need to let Israel finish the job first and talk about these other issues later. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=160.0s)]
*  Yeah, and speaking of Iran, there's also this other report that says that Iran is urging [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=164.72s)]
*  its proxies not to provoke the United States into a wider war. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  They're essentially telling all the H-groups, Hezbollah, the Houthis, to kind of dial it [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=172.88s)]
*  back in the Red Sea and bombing our military bases in the Middle East. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=178.16s)]
*  What is your read on that? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=182.52s)]
*  Well, I'm a little skeptical. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=183.84s)]
*  I mean, it sounds great if that's true, if somehow President Biden was able to reestablish [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=185.96s)]
*  some deterrence and that they're rolling back. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=191.32000000000002s)]
*  But I have my doubts. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=194.12s)]
*  I, of course, saw yesterday, like you, all the news that the Houthi were shooting at [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=195.12s)]
*  ships again, and even crippled one that's from the U.K. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=199.68s)]
*  So I have my doubts about this. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=203.9s)]
*  The proof will be in the pudding. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=205.74s)]
*  Let's see how it looks in the coming weeks. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=206.92000000000002s)]
*  But make no mistake, Iran is still after us in the medium to long term to try and kick [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=209.52s)]
*  us out of the region. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=214.56s)]
*  So I wouldn't look for them to be too hospitable. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=215.78s)]
*  Yeah, the Houthis are also claiming responsibility for shooting down a U.S. drone off the coast [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=218.3s)]
*  of Yemen. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=223.3s)]
*  The U.S. is investigating exactly what happened there. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=224.3s)]
*  Really quickly, what is your take on that? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=226.9s)]
*  Do you think the Houthis did, in fact, shoot down this drone? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=229.02s)]
*  It's an MQ-9 Reaper drone. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=232.58s)]
*  I think they did. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=235.38s)]
*  And now, look, they're going to get—this reminds everyone—they're going to get some [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=236.38s)]
*  missiles through. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=239.98s)]
*  Eventually, they may get one at one of our warships. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=241.3s)]
*  So we've got to be careful and work hard to degrade their capabilities as quickly as [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=244.3s)]
*  possible. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=249.78s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot going on. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=250.78s)]
*  But as Todd just reported, let's all focus on pronouns as well. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=251.78s)]
*  Husband and wife. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=253.98000000000002s)]
*  Michael, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=254.98000000000002s)]
*  Have a great day. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=256.78000000000003s)]
*  We appreciate your analysis, as always. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UthnazsQHS8&t=257.78000000000003s)]
