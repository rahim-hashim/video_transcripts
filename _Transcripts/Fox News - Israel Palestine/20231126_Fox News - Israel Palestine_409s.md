# Joe Biden gets an 'F' grade for this: Rep. Matt Gaetz
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM)
*  want to help Ukraine resist Russia's war of unprovoked aggression. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=0.0s)]
*  So in return for providing additional funding for Ukraine, we have to have significant and [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=4.86s)]
*  substantial reforms to our border policies. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  President Biden has been drawing on his 50 years of foreign policy experience to walk [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=12.26s)]
*  a narrow tightrope over a wide chasm quite effectively. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=16.52s)]
*  Now that's in sharp contrast to the Republican Party over Ukraine. This is the party that, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=21.72s)]
*  as we heard from Senator Cotton, likes to invoke Ronald Reagan, the man who helped liberate [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=26.8s)]
*  Ukraine from Russia. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  That was some of the back and forth between Senator Tom Cotton and Congressman Jake Ochenkos [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=33.08s)]
*  from Fox News Sunday on the spending decisions facing lawmakers on Capitol Hill. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=36.8s)]
*  For more on that, I'm joined by Florida Republican congressman and member of the House Armed [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=42.2s)]
*  Services and Judiciary Committee's Matt Gaetz. Welcome, Congressman. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=45.92s)]
*  Thanks so much. I can't get the image out of my mind of President Biden on a tightrope [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=50.96s)]
*  after Jake Ochenkos' statement. Quite something. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=54.8s)]
*  Well, so there is an effort to get funding for Israel and Ukraine passed through Congress [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=58.08s)]
*  by Christmas. Should there be a border component included before lawmakers do that? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  I believe all these issues should be addressed separately. However one feels about Ukraine [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=71.36s)]
*  or Israel or our own border, I think we should all responsibly acknowledge that they deserve [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=76.14s)]
*  their own dignity. The problem is most Republicans don't support continuing U.S. involvement [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=81.32s)]
*  in Ukraine. That becomes a political weight. And most Americans do support continuing to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=87.19999999999999s)]
*  keep our close alliance with Israel well resourced and on the right track. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=93.8s)]
*  And so really what you hear from a number of folks in the Senate, Republican and Democrat, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=98.28s)]
*  is that they want to use the goodwill Americans have toward Israel to drag along our continued [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=103.0s)]
*  involvement in Ukraine. As to the border provision specifically, I'm increasingly concerned that [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=109.56s)]
*  on the border the problem isn't money. We know exactly what to do to fix our border [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=115.47999999999999s)]
*  problem. It's the remain in Mexico policies. It's the Title 42 authorities that President [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  Trump had put in place. And it's the safe third country provisions that didn't have [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=125.17999999999999s)]
*  people trekking all the way into the United States for an asylum claim that they would [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=129.64s)]
*  never ultimately show up to in court. So I'm not for the Joe Biden $100 billion supplemental [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=135.56s)]
*  that will make things more challenging on the border and certainly won't make us safer [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=142.12s)]
*  abroad. But do you worry about what happens to Ukraine and war in Europe if the United [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=145.6s)]
*  States backs off supporting the Ukrainians? I'm more worried about a nuclear Russia engaging [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=150.52s)]
*  in some sort of escalatory accident that could draw the United States into literally a nuclear [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=158.6s)]
*  conflict than I am about broken down Russian tanks in the Donbas region. I don't believe [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=163.88s)]
*  that the American people want to pay another $100 billion to figure out which guy gets [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=169.64000000000001s)]
*  to run Crimea. We seem to almost be hitting a point there in the conflict where the Russian-speaking [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=174.92000000000002s)]
*  territories look very differently than what you see from the Western-leaning cities in [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=181.48000000000002s)]
*  Ukraine like Kiev. So I'm far more concerned about what will happen to our people if we [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=186.16s)]
*  continue this tomfoolery. All right, let's go to the Middle East. More hostages are being [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=192.12s)]
*  released including today, including that precious four-year-old American girl. How do you grade [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=196.68s)]
*  President Biden's performance when it comes to the Israel-Hamas conflict? We're certainly [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=202.12s)]
*  glad that she is home to any hostage that is released. But your last guest talked about [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  how the Biden policies toward Iran have actually animated more violence from Hamas. So I would [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  give Joe Biden an F because he's allowing billions of dollars to be accessed and cash [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=221.28s)]
*  flow finance from Iran. We already know what Iran will do with that. They will use it to [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=226.8s)]
*  extend their malign influence. And it's worth noting that even the Biden administration's [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=232.44s)]
*  own inspector general at USAID is saying that a lot of this humanitarian assistance that [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=237.08s)]
*  Biden was just trumpeting from Nantucket actually ends up in the hands of Hamas. So let's not [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=243.28s)]
*  fund Hamas through Iran. Let's not feed Hamas through these USAID and other so-called humanitarian [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=249.44s)]
*  programs. So what more should the president do in terms of pinching Iran and being more [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=257.8s)]
*  careful with the aid to Hamas? Is that your view? Well, I don't know that we have a situation [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=263.48s)]
*  in Gaza where we can send aid that isn't controlled by Hamas. In a lot of ways, it's very similar [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=269.16s)]
*  to what we dealt with in Somalia in the 90s where we wanted to ensure that people had [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=274.76s)]
*  food and medicine, but providing that provision was often scooped up by warlords. So I think [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=278.8s)]
*  the best thing to happen, frankly, for the people of Gaza, for the people of Israel and [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=284.88s)]
*  throughout the Middle East, is to see Hamas entirely defeated, allow the folks in Gaza [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=289.2s)]
*  to have some semblance of peace without being terrorized by Hamas. And that'll likely lead [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=295.32s)]
*  to safer conditions than we've seen. And if we continue with this hostage trading diplomacy, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=300.0s)]
*  as glad as we are to see those hostages home, I worry that that sets up a new paradigm where [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=304.92s)]
*  more hostages might be taken to buy time for more military operations that could actually [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=310.6s)]
*  lead to more death and destruction. So it's very perilous right now. I mentioned you're on the [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=316.68s)]
*  Armed Services Committee. Congress has the power of the purse. The Pentagon has requested $114 [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=321.0s)]
*  million for spending on diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility. The most expensive [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=326.6s)]
*  request on this front that it has made. What's your reaction to that? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=333.0s)]
*  It is deeply troubling that we have some military leaders who want to build social justice warriors [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=338.04s)]
*  instead of warriors who are survivable and lethal and capable on the battlefield. We just saw in [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=343.56s)]
*  Minot, North Dakota, some military leaders admonish potential service members from even [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=349.8s)]
*  attending a conference with Turning Point USA, a conservative group that is certainly not out of [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=355.24s)]
*  the mainstream. And at the same time, they're saying you can't go to a conservative function. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=360.12s)]
*  They are seeking all this money for diversity, equity, and inclusion. And even in our National [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=365.64s)]
*  War College, we're seeing more and more books and pedagogy emerge that teach the value of embracing [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=370.92s)]
*  socialism as a geopolitical military strategy. I think we've got great service members. I think [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=377.24s)]
*  they're not being served well by some of the top leadership at the Pentagon. And at least I'm [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=383.24s)]
*  hopeful that when we called out the bad actions at Minot Air Force Base, they reversed course. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=387.88s)]
*  Congressman MacGate to the great state of Florida, thank you very much for your time today. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy71ahj7SfM&t=392.92s)]
