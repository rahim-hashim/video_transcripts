# Israeli minister reveals atrocities by Hamas: 'They burned people alive'
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY)
*  I want to go to a near market right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=0.0s)]
*  These there really minister of the [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=2.04s)]
*  economy, former mayor of Jerusalem and mayor. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  It's always good to have you. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=5.88s)]
*  I did want to get your take on this, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=7.36s)]
*  but we're told imminent hostage deal, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=9.68s)]
*  maybe 50 released. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=11.6s)]
*  Can you tell us anything about what you know? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=13.52s)]
*  Well, Neil, it's very simple. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=17.56s)]
*  Eventually we need total surrender of Hamas, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=20.0s)]
*  like Nazi Germany, like Imperial Japan. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  We need to wipe them off the face of the Earth. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=27.52s)]
*  And until we do that, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=30.48s)]
*  the war is not going to stop. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=32.4s)]
*  We're also asking where's the Red Cross? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=33.84s)]
*  Where the 239 people that were abducted from Israel [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=37.68s)]
*  that are now kidnapped. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  And fortunately today, just not long ago, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  we found a body of one of the hostages. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  And we had to bring her home, not alive. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=49.44s)]
*  And we're asking where are the rest of the hostages? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=53.2s)]
*  Let me ask you, Minister, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=57.760000000000005s)]
*  some people are beginning to wonder just how many [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  of those 239 are alive. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=60.96s)]
*  And that's why you might only be getting 50 now [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=64.88000000000001s)]
*  if it even comes to pass. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=68.4s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  Well, Neil, you saw the atrocities. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=72.16s)]
*  You saw how they burn people alive. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=74.4s)]
*  You saw how they rape women and put a little baby [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=77.68s)]
*  in the oven and cook him. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=80.80000000000001s)]
*  We saw all the atrocities and they filmed it themselves. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=84.48s)]
*  They were proud of it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=88.16s)]
*  This is totally crazy. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=89.92s)]
*  They're monsters. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  Now, we don't know what they're doing with the hostages. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=93.92s)]
*  They don't see them as hostages. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=96.16s)]
*  They see them as something. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=97.75999999999999s)]
*  I don't know what, not as human beings. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=100.0s)]
*  And this is so shameful. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=103.36s)]
*  Now, the world has to ask very aggressive [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=105.6s)]
*  and hard questions. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  We want them all. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=109.44s)]
*  We want them all back. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=110.64s)]
*  And we will do whatever it needs to bring our people back. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=112.32s)]
*  But it is totally absurd, the situation. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=117.92s)]
*  And we need the help of the world. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=120.24s)]
*  We need the help of the United States. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=121.92s)]
*  And this is a great opportunity to thank President Biden [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  for his amazing support. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=126.64s)]
*  We will never forget our friends. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=128.48s)]
*  You folks have stood behind us at the toughest times [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=130.4s)]
*  Israel ever had since its existence. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=133.6s)]
*  And we will never forget that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=135.68s)]
*  There are divisions in this country [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=138.8s)]
*  that might surprise you, Minister, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=141.12s)]
*  and we've talked about it before, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=143.12s)]
*  where some are pushing and pulling at the president. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=144.88s)]
*  You've got to be careful. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=148.48s)]
*  Israel's got to stop these airstrikes on Gaza. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=149.92s)]
*  They've got to have a ceasefire. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=153.04s)]
*  You hear it all the time, and you hear it certainly [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=154.88s)]
*  not only from members of the Arab community, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=157.28s)]
*  but Western nations as well. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=159.44s)]
*  Any level, does that trouble you? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  Because you only had a few days of global sort of support [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=164.4s)]
*  and sympathy after the October 7th attack. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=168.32s)]
*  And that was it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=170.88s)]
*  Then the world sentiment, not everyone, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=171.68s)]
*  I want to stress, Minister, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=174.32s)]
*  but began to turn to these pro-Palestinian rallies, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=175.84s)]
*  some bold enough to say we're pro-Hamas rallies. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=181.6s)]
*  What do you make of all that? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=185.6s)]
*  The atrocities are worse than the Nazis. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=188.56s)]
*  The Nazis hit those atrocities. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=191.92s)]
*  And the Hamas, ISIS didn't even hide it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=194.16s)]
*  They were proud of it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=197.51999999999998s)]
*  And remember, I don't remember that in the war [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=198.95999999999998s)]
*  to against Germany, I don't remember anybody asking [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=202.08s)]
*  for any kind of humanitarian gestures. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=207.12s)]
*  Just complete, 100% surrender. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=211.52s)]
*  This is what we will happen to Hamas. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=215.6s)]
*  And we, in Israel, we have very, very soft heart for people. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=218.88s)]
*  We don't want to hit any innocent people. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=223.68s)]
*  We hide our people in shelters. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=226.08s)]
*  They don't. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=227.68s)]
*  They hide behind their citizens. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=228.48s)]
*  They're using our people as human shield. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  And we have to go through this and make sure [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=234.88s)]
*  we don't hurt innocent people. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=237.12s)]
*  And we enable them to flow back to safety [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=239.04s)]
*  on the southern part of Gaza when we attack the north part. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=241.84s)]
*  And we don't need the world to tell us. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=245.12s)]
*  We know we'll be as considerate as possible. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=246.8s)]
*  However, we will wipe Hamas off the face of the earth. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=249.6s)]
*  No compromise. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  And you know, this is not just for Israel. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=255.44s)]
*  There's a reason why the Arab states, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=258.64000000000004s)]
*  the moderate Arab states are waiting for us to beat Hamas. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=261.04s)]
*  There's a reason because the world understand [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=265.92s)]
*  that if the Islamic Jihad is successful [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=268.16s)]
*  in this horrendous attack and they get away with it, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=271.76s)]
*  it's going to happen all over the world. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=276.64s)]
*  That's why we have to win and have total surrender. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=278.72s)]
*  And we need the help of the world. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=283.36s)]
*  Give us the time we need. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=284.56s)]
*  We're considerate. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=285.76s)]
*  We don't want to hurt innocent people, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=287.04s)]
*  but we have to wipe Hamas off the face of the earth. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=292.72s)]
*  We'll keep following this hostage release [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=293.12s)]
*  if it's imminent or whatever. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=295.28000000000003s)]
*  But there are obviously a lot of moving parts [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=297.12s)]
*  at the same time, minister. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=299.28000000000003s)]
*  Thank you very much for taking the time to chat with us. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOzram-lTZY&t=300.40000000000003s)]
