*  People are wondering why they feel so helpless on the campus and why the police didn't arrive [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCzn3w5n1hA&t=72.3s)]
*  sooner because the violence has been taking place for hours, Todd and Carly. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCzn3w5n1hA&t=76.66s)]

*  arrested. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCzn3w5n1hA&t=142.45999999999998s)]
*  Protests have also erupted at Portland State University and perhaps taking a cue from the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCzn3w5n1hA&t=143.98s)]
*  students at Columbia, they have taken over the local library. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCzn3w5n1hA&t=147.98s)]

*  Right now, chaos on a number of college campuses across the country. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCzn3w5n1hA&t=171.78s)]
*  Critics say police needed to be called in much sooner. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCzn3w5n1hA&t=174.94s)]
*  Recall the occupation of the building named after Alexander Hamilton in Columbia. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCzn3w5n1hA&t=178.5s)]
