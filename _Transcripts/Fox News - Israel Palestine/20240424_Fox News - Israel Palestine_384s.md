# Columbia protests rage overnight past midnight deadline
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo)
*  A Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=0.0s)]
*  Protests raging at Columbia University as students and outside demonstrators flood campus [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=3.84s)]
*  throughout the night, well past the midnight deadline to disperse. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=8.56s)]
*  The university releasing a statement around three o'clock in the morning claiming, quote, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=29.28s)]
*  we are making important progress with representatives of the student encampment on the West Lawn. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=33.160000000000004s)]
*  Student protesters have committed to dismantling and removing a significant number of tents. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=37.84s)]
*  In light of this constructive dialogue, the university will continue conversations for [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=42.56s)]
*  the next 48 hours. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=46.52s)]
*  Me time house speaker Mike Johnson set to visit the university today to meet with Jewish [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=48.040000000000006s)]
*  students. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  He's also expected to hold a press conference on anti-Semitism at around 3 45 this afternoon. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=53.32s)]
*  With that, let us bring in Amy Gallatin, whose daughter goes to Barnard, which is a partner [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=59.7s)]
*  school with Columbia. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=63.14s)]
*  Her daughter also lives right near all the chaos and she joins me now. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=64.68s)]
*  Amy, thanks for being here. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=68.64s)]
*  Um, I don't know about you. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=70.12s)]
*  Don't you think $90,000 a year for tuition room board, the whole nut there should get [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=71.84s)]
*  you more than zoom classes and constant fear. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=77.08s)]
*  Uh, absolutely. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=82.72s)]
*  He asks. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=85.72s)]
*  Um, it's, uh, it's, it's quite a nightmare and nobody expected this. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=87.28s)]
*  This is not a global pandemic. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=93.16s)]
*  This is a global conflict and it shouldn't be affecting my child's or any child's ability [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=95.64s)]
*  to just simply go to class and have a college experience. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=100.64s)]
*  What does your daughter tell you about what daily life is like as a Jew on this campus [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=104.36s)]
*  right now? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=109.4s)]
*  It's challenging, Todd. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=111.72s)]
*  Um, uh, she's, uh, she's a proud Jew, um, but it is clearly very threatening. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=118.72s)]
*  It's not that the Jews are quote fearful so much as they are being threatened. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=128.8s)]
*  Um, all of them, um, you have to be very careful of where you walk, where you go. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=134.36s)]
*  And, um, even just have being able to go and choose what dining hall that you want to [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=141.4s)]
*  go to or being able to go to the gym or being able to go to the library for that matter. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=149.6s)]
*  Um, right now was certainly in the last week and a half that's been very off limits, but [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=155.24s)]
*  the climate's been pretty toxic since October 7th. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=160.32s)]
*  How do you process this all as a parent? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  Um, a lot of sleepless nights, um, certainly in the last week where, and, um, very, very [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=168.8s)]
*  concerned. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=180.20000000000002s)]
*  I mean, fortunately I live very close, um, to campus, but, um, but you worry. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  I mean, every parent worries about their kid going off to school or their child. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  This is, um, this is my firstborn. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  And, um, you just want them to have an experience, but when you're now having to reconcile what's [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=195.56s)]
*  happening in their classrooms on top of what's happening on the campus, it's, it's a very [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=204.4s)]
*  disturbing thing and it's making all of the parents, uh, extremely concerned. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=211.60000000000002s)]
*  Amy, I know where you live. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=216.8s)]
*  You live in West Orange, New Jersey. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=218.4s)]
*  I grew up in Verona. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=219.8s)]
*  Our parents are the same. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=221.02s)]
*  You grew up in that North Jersey cauldron of wanting your kid to go to the best Ivy [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=222.92s)]
*  League school he or she can get into. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=227.68s)]
*  And you as a parent put in countless hours trying to help your kid. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  And you script and you save and you save all this money for the college. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=234.28s)]
*  And your kid, i.e. me in this scenario, your daughter in this scenario, works her tail [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=237.6s)]
*  off, sacrifices so many parties, so many fun things to put herself in a position to go [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=242.28s)]
*  to a school like Columbia. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=247.18s)]
*  And then this happens. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=249.0s)]
*  She can't go to school. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=250.66s)]
*  She's got to worry about where she goes to eat because of protests against her religion. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=252.04s)]
*  And everything has changed in her world. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=256.84s)]
*  How much longer can she stay there? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=259.32s)]
*  Is she going to transfer? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=261.08s)]
*  And do you want her to transfer? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=262.08s)]
*  That conversation needs to be directed by her. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=271.56s)]
*  I think that that's a decision any student needs to make for themselves and not really [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=276.2s)]
*  be driven by parents. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=282.59999999999997s)]
*  But I understand a lot of parents are feeling the, you know, you need to get out of there. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=285.4s)]
*  I've spent time with her on the phone and said, you know, do you want to come home? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=291.88s)]
*  And we kind of toss it out there. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=299.47999999999996s)]
*  But she, my daughter loves where she is. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=301.44s)]
*  This is exactly what she wanted. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=306.2s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=307.88s)]
*  She worked so hard to get there. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=308.88s)]
*  It's exactly what she wanted from being in the city, but also that campus environment. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=312.56s)]
*  And being in the city, and I will repeat that again, because it's part of the quote real [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=322.03999999999996s)]
*  world. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=329.32s)]
*  And it's fun, of course. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=332.96s)]
*  But now she's banging on to the wee hours of the night. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=334.8s)]
*  She's got a tough decision to make because she's facing all this. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=339.04s)]
*  It's got to be really difficult. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=345.12s)]
*  The school said, look, obviously, we strive to support safety, student learning. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=346.32000000000005s)]
*  That's the reason we're going hybrid. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=350.96000000000004s)]
*  But I don't know about you. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=352.08000000000004s)]
*  If Columbia can't really ensure two fundamental things of an education, that you get an education [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=353.08000000000004s)]
*  from in-class students and in-class professors and the fact that you can't be safe, I don't [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=357.52000000000004s)]
*  know if that president should stay. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=363.48s)]
*  Amy Gallatin, we appreciate your time. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=364.8s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=366.64000000000004s)]
*  Best of luck to your daughter. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=367.64000000000004s)]
*  Well, that's the interesting thing. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=368.64000000000004s)]
*  We got to go. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=369.64000000000004s)]
*  I got to leave it there, Amy. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=370.64000000000004s)]
*  We'll check back in with you. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHcN4l3THo&t=371.64000000000004s)]
