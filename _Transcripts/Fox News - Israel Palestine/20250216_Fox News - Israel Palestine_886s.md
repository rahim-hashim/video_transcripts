*  Hamas this weekend released three more Israeli hostages, including the last living Israeli [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=13.76s)]
*  American, after the terrorist group initially said it would postpone the release, claiming [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=18.78s)]
*  that Israel violated the terms of the ceasefire agreement. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=23.44s)]
*  The reversal coming after President Trump threatened Hamas that if all the remaining [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=26.86s)]
*  hostages were not released by 12 p.m. yesterday, quote, all hell is going to break out. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=30.88s)]
*  The first phase of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas set to end this month with little [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=37.78s)]
*  known about any progress on the terms of the second phase. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=41.980000000000004s)]
*  That phase was supposed to bring the return of all hostages in exchange for the release [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=45.78s)]
*  of a total of 1700 Palestinian prisoners who committed real crimes, as well as Israel's [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=50.38s)]
*  withdrawal from Gaza and a permanent ceasefire. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=56.74s)]
*  The bulk of the progress in the release of the hostages so far happening in just the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=59.86s)]
*  last three months. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=63.82s)]

*  envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=95.58s)]
*  Steve, thank you so much for all of your efforts, all that you have done, and thank you for [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=97.9s)]
*  joining us right now. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=101.86s)]
*  Oh, it's my pleasure, Maria. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=104.54s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=105.74000000000001s)]
*  Before we get to Israel and Hamas, let me get your take on your plans in Saudi Arabia. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=106.74000000000001s)]
*  Are you expecting to leave for Saudi tonight and what specifically are you hoping to accomplish? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=111.54s)]
*  Well, I want to I don't want to talk too much about that in specifically Maria, but I am [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=119.26s)]
*  going tonight. I'll be traveling there with the national security adviser and we'll be [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=124.74000000000001s)]
*  having meetings at the direction of the president and hopefully we'll we'll make some really [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=130.94s)]
*  good progress with regard to Russia, Ukraine. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=136.26000000000002s)]
*  Is there anything you can say about some of your allies alarmed by the fact that Ukraine [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=140.22s)]
*  is not part of the talks? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=146.42000000000002s)]
*  Well, I think Ukraine is part of the talks. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=150.06s)]
*  The president had their president Zelensky on the phone this past week. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=152.14000000000001s)]
*  I am I am pretty sure that a you know, a lot of our cabinet people, including Treasury [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=159.14000000000001s)]
*  Secretary Besant, the vice president, Mike Walls, John Radcliffe, our secretary of state, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=166.22s)]
*  Marco Rubio, have been meeting with various Ukrainian people at the Munich Security Conference. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=174.14000000000001s)]
*  So I don't I don't think this is about excluding anybody. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=179.74s)]
*  In fact, it's about including everybody. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=182.86s)]
*  And final question on this, do you expect Ukraine will have to give up a significant [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=185.7s)]
*  portion of its land? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=189.54s)]
*  And do we believe that if so, Putin will be done after this? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=190.62s)]
*  You know, those are those are those are details, and I'm not I'm not dismissive of the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=196.54s)]
*  details. They're important. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=201.82s)]
*  But I think the beginning here is trust building. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=203.38s)]
*  It's getting everybody to understand that this war does not belong continuing, that [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=206.38s)]
*  it should end. That's what the president has directed us to do, to negotiate a a proper [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=211.98s)]
*  ending of this war. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=218.94s)]
*  No more death. There's been too much already. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=220.26s)]
*  That's what he said. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=222.66s)]
*  And that's the direction. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=223.98s)]
*  And that's what we're going to do. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=225.74s)]
*  Let me move on to Israel. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=227.38s)]
*  You've done such an incredible job in terms of getting some of these hostages home. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=228.78s)]
*  Tomorrow is the 500th day that the hostages have been in captivity. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=234.14s)]
*  Will there be a phase two? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=239.58s)]
*  Have the terms been drawn up there? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=241.26000000000002s)]
*  Well, faced, Maria, faced, who is a little bit more complicated than phase one, but phase [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=245.66000000000003s)]
*  two is absolutely going to begin. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=250.74s)]
*  I've actually had calls this morning, I can tell you, with Prime Minister Netanyahu, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=253.26000000000002s)]
*  with Prime Minister Mohammed from Qatar and as well with director Hassan from Egypt, who [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=259.22s)]
*  is their director of intelligence. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=268.02s)]
*  And we are we had very, very productive and constructive calls this morning about the [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=270.06s)]
*  sequencing of phase two, setting forth positions on both sides so we can understand where [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=276.26s)]
*  we level set where we are today and then continuing talks this week at a location to be [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=282.85999999999996s)]
*  determined so that we can figure out how we get to the end of phase two successfully. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=288.26s)]
*  Do you expect phase two to include the release of all of the hostages? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=295.22s)]
*  And Steve, how many of those hostages do you believe are still alive? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=299.18s)]
*  Well, phase two includes 19 IDF soldiers. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=305.58000000000004s)]
*  We believe all of them are alive and some others, too, as well. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=309.5s)]
*  It includes Edon Alexander, who, of course, we've been pressing for because he is an [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=312.90000000000003s)]
*  American and Israeli citizen as well. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=318.1s)]
*  So it includes all of these people. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=320.90000000000003s)]
*  It also includes getting families back, the bodies of members of their family who have [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=323.22s)]
*  died so that they can probably be able to mourn for them today and in the future. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=329.7s)]
*  So it includes all it includes all of those people. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=336.78000000000003s)]
*  It just is a little bit more intricate and complicated in terms of how we how we bring [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=341.18s)]
*  the two sides together on this, because because phase two contemplates an end of the war, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=347.38s)]
*  but it also contemplates Hamas not being involved in the government and being gone from Gaza. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=353.65999999999997s)]
*  So we've got to we've got to square those two things. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=359.06s)]
*  Steve, you are the first American official to visit Gaza. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=362.21999999999997s)]
*  Can you share with us a little of what you have witnessed? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=365.58s)]
*  I mean, you know, it must be mentioned, the fact that, you know, 1700 Palestinian prisoners [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=368.94s)]
*  are expected to be released, some of whom have committed serious crimes, try to commit [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=376.14s)]
*  terrorism on on on the world and they're being released. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=381.97999999999996s)]
*  The people who are being released and the hostages in Gaza were going about their lives at a [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=386.62s)]
*  concert. Can you tell us a bit about what you witnessed, including seeing some of those [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=391.65999999999997s)]
*  caves and tunnels? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=396.74s)]
*  Sure. Well, so, Maria, I felt it was important for me to go to Gaza. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=400.18s)]
*  And why? Because phase one, the execution of phase one was an accomplishment. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=404.46s)]
*  It brought it brought a lot of people together who needed to work hard to get that accomplished. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=409.29999999999995s)]
*  But what was always going to be more complicated was the implementation of phase one, which [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=414.58s)]
*  meant the Nazarene line, the Philadelphia corridor, how people are crossing, how they were [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=420.06s)]
*  going to be, how security procedures would be instituted. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=425.26s)]
*  And a small little blow up on phase one could have ended all of phase one. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=429.82s)]
*  So we so far have been able to successfully navigate that. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=434.82s)]
*  And I felt that there was no way to navigate it unless you were somebody was actually on [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=438.9s)]
*  premises in Gaza. What I saw there was alarming. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=443.38s)]
*  It it's it's completely devastated. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=447.9s)]
*  And that begs the question, should people be allowed in there in the in those sorts of [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=451.05999999999995s)]
*  dangerous conditions? Thank God we've had no incidents. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=456.82s)]
*  But there's 30,000 unexploded shells throughout Gaza and the buildings are all down. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=459.62s)]
*  It's utter destruction. There's all kinds of issues. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=466.22s)]
*  This affects, by the way, phase three, which is the theoretical reconstruction of Gaza. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=470.02s)]
*  We're going to have to get to a reconstruction, but the devil will be in the details on the [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=475.66s)]
*  master plan, on how we examine everything subterranean, which has been blown up. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=480.3s)]
*  So lots of issues with that. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=485.94s)]
*  With all of that said, I also saw a film of what happened on October 7th, and that was a [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=488.5s)]
*  horrific film. So I've got some I've got some context. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=494.53999999999996s)]
*  And that was important for me to have. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=499.78s)]
*  And given those 30,000, I mean, all of the shells that were unexploded, you've said that this [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=503.21999999999997s)]
*  area is uninhibitable. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=510.5s)]
*  And President Trump has said that you just can't go back there. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=512.78s)]
*  You would never send your children there knowing that you've got all these potential shells that [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=516.42s)]
*  could explode. As a result, President Trump said that the U.S. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=521.18s)]
*  will own Gaza. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=525.02s)]
*  I know you've had some pushback from some regional leaders there. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=526.22s)]
*  I guess Egypt is coming up with its own plan. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=530.98s)]
*  But from your background as a real estate professional, give us your sense of why you [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=533.62s)]
*  believe that is, in fact, a viable result. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=538.82s)]
*  Well, let me say this, Maria. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=541.42s)]
*  First of all, as usual, the president the president comes out, says something new and unique. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=544.9399999999999s)]
*  He gets attacked for it. By the way, that happens when new and unique proposals come to the [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=550.9399999999999s)]
*  fore. But it also encouraged a lot of conversation. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=555.14s)]
*  So now we have the Egyptians saying we have a plan. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=559.2199999999999s)]
*  The Jordanians are saying we have a plan and people are actually engaging in really important [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=562.02s)]
*  discussion about what ought to happen there. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=568.6999999999999s)]
*  The president, first and foremost, and he's a real estate person by training, too, and I went [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=571.5s)]
*  into the business because of him. He inspired me who wouldn't want to be like Donald Trump. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=576.54s)]
*  So but the president's position is why are we going to necessarily default to a policy [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=581.78s)]
*  prescription that has been where the same policy prescription has been implemented for [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=588.6999999999999s)]
*  the last four or five decades and it hasn't worked. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=595.66s)]
*  So maybe we need to explore new policy prescriptions that ultimately end up in a better life for [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=598.74s)]
*  Gazans and Palestinians. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=606.26s)]
*  And I think it's as simple as that. And it's very, very sensible. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=608.3399999999999s)]
*  For some reason, people have a problem with him saying things like that, but he doesn't for all [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=612.02s)]
*  the right reasons. Look at the discourse that's now happening today. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=617.14s)]
*  We're actually engaging in a productive conversation around what is best for Gaza and [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=620.14s)]
*  how do we make people's lives better. And I think that's a better program. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=625.62s)]
*  And of course, President Trump spoke with the King of Jordan, who did agree to accept sick [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=629.0600000000001s)]
*  children. But the others and largely all of the regional partners said that they really do not [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=635.38s)]
*  want to accept those people who are living in Gaza right now. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=643.14s)]
*  Well, we've talked to look, we've we've talked. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=647.14s)]
*  I think Gaza is a really rough place to go back to. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=652.9s)]
*  I think that families going back there thinking that there's an easy reconstruction process, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=656.9s)]
*  that they've been they've been on some level deceived. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=663.98s)]
*  And I think that's part of President Trump's message, that we don't want people going back there [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=668.06s)]
*  being injured, being hurt. God forbid being killed because a building falls down on them [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=672.98s)]
*  inadvertently or God forbid they a child playing in the streets touches an unexploded [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=677.74s)]
*  munition and it explodes and he loses his hands or his arms or or any one of these terrible [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=683.78s)]
*  things that could happen. That's kind of the point. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=690.98s)]
*  And I think that the president's solution is how do we address where where people where [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=694.1s)]
*  two million people can go? And I think the obvious answers are in some respects, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=701.26s)]
*  Egypt, in some respects, Jordan, but in some respects, other countries who have called us up [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=707.26s)]
*  and voluntarily said, this is a humanitarian effort. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=712.18s)]
*  We want to help you. We want to participate in this humanitarian effort. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=715.66s)]
*  And I think that's to be commended. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=719.9399999999999s)]
*  And of course, President Trump has put once again maximum pressure on Iran. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=722.38s)]
*  What is the situation in terms of Iran and how can you make a dent in stopping Iran from [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=727.2199999999999s)]
*  supporting these proxies like Hamas? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=734.5799999999999s)]
*  Well, that's the ultimate question, Maria. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=738.8199999999999s)]
*  And that's what we've got to answer. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=741.66s)]
*  All roads lead to Iran or Iran in this in this in this Middle Eastern conflict. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=744.06s)]
*  What happened? The Houthis, the Hezbollah, Hamas, they're all they're all sponsored by Iran. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=752.18s)]
*  And Iran is the benefactor. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=758.98s)]
*  But of course, the largest issue is the nuclear. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=761.02s)]
*  And the president has said they will not get a bomb. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=763.6999999999999s)]
*  Them getting a bomb is is devastating to the region. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=766.78s)]
*  It will mean it will force every other country in that region to get a bomb to. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=770.58s)]
*  We'll have a nuclear arms race, and that simply can't happen. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=774.8199999999999s)]
*  But the president has also said this can be solved diplomatically. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=778.0999999999999s)]
*  And if Iran shows a an interest in solving it diplomatically, the American government remains open to those discussions. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=784.3399999999999s)]
*  And so I hope that it can be solved diplomatically, because the alternative is not such a good alternative. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=794.42s)]
*  Steve, there was gunfire this morning near Gaza. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=802.3s)]
*  Has the ceasefire ended? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=807.58s)]
*  Is there anything we need to be aware of in terms of where we stand today with this ceasefire agreement? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=809.22s)]
*  Well, I'm not aware of the gunfire, Maria. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=817.7s)]
*  Now that you're telling it to me, I'll I'll ask the question. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=819.94s)]
*  But I think I think the ceasefire is holding. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=824.0600000000001s)]
*  I think we are in discussions about how to finish the next hostage release. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=828.1800000000001s)]
*  And there'll be an Israeli delegation going to either Doha or Cairo. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=833.86s)]
*  And so so I think that the ceasefire is holding. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=838.3000000000001s)]
*  There could have been a circumstance of shooting, but hopefully it's not big enough to have changed this situation on the ground. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=842.62s)]
*  I think we're we're stable and things are where they where they are supposed to be. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=852.14s)]
*  Steve, again, thank you so much for all of your efforts. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=857.1800000000001s)]
*  We'll be watching your work in Saudi Arabia as your efforts continue now toward Ukraine. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=859.4599999999999s)]
*  We appreciate your time, Steve. Thank you. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=866.9799999999999s)]
*  Thank you, Maria. All right, Steve Witkoff, joining us today and a special envoy to the Middle East. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0i_26-kE6Y&t=870.18s)]
