# Hamas leaders turning on each other: Israeli special ops vet
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4qIemfFWw)
*  Nate, thank you. Let's bring in Aaron Cohen, former member of Israel's Special Operations [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4qIemfFWw&t=0.0s)]
*  Counter-Terrorist Unit. Aaron, great to have you on. You bring some breaking news. I know [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4qIemfFWw&t=4.44s)]
*  your IDF sources are great. You're hearing that these prisoners, these Hamas leaders [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4qIemfFWw&t=7.8s)]
*  who are now prisoners, are turning on some of the other leaders in southern Gaza. What [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4qIemfFWw&t=13.72s)]
*  are you finding out? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4qIemfFWw&t=18.6s)]
*  Well, that's exactly what's happening, Trace. And what I'm hearing is this. Yusef Al-Mansi, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4qIemfFWw&t=19.6s)]
*  who's the former communications minister for Hamas in Gaza, has just been interrogated. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4qIemfFWw&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  He was part of that 500 plus Hamas members who were taken prisoner by the Israelists, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4qIemfFWw&t=29.28s)]
*  surrendered to the IDF because of that pressure cooker, sir lachatz in Hebrew, that campaign [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4qIemfFWw&t=33.36s)]
*  that Israel's been putting on for the last 60 plus days. In an interrogation with Israel's [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4qIemfFWw&t=38.64s)]
*  intelligence unit, Shin Bet, or Shabbat, is literally turning on Yechi Sinwar, the leader [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4qIemfFWw&t=43.72s)]
*  of Gaza in the southern portion of Gaza who's up close with those hostages, and he's calling [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4qIemfFWw&t=50.72s)]
*  for Sinwar to step down. All of these Hamas members are surrendering themselves because [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4qIemfFWw&t=56.24s)]
*  they believe that Sinwar, who's become essentially the bin Laden of Gaza, they believe that he's [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4qIemfFWw&t=60.32s)]
*  absolutely lost his mind. He's bringing Gaza back 200 years into the Stone Age, and Hamas [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4qIemfFWw&t=65.52s)]
*  is turning on him, and it's happening very quickly through these interrogations. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4qIemfFWw&t=69.8s)]
*  The Iranian foreign minister said the following, quoting here, at any moment there is a possibility [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4qIemfFWw&t=73.16s)]
*  of a big explosion in the region, not one controllable by any party, and of course he [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4qIemfFWw&t=77.42s)]
*  means regional explosion, meaning regional war. Do you see it going that way, Karen? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4qIemfFWw&t=83.04s)]
*  I do, I do. I think this is all part of Iran's larger picture here. You've got the Houthis, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4qIemfFWw&t=87.44000000000001s)]
*  you've got the Iraq-ISIS element, which is also connected to Iran. You've got Hamas. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4qIemfFWw&t=92.80000000000001s)]
*  Trace, Iran is, all these proxies, I don't know why we're looking at them as proxies. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4qIemfFWw&t=98.04s)]
*  This is Iran. These proxies are Iran, and Iran thinks that by using these proxies, we [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4qIemfFWw&t=103.36000000000001s)]
*  don't see that this is Iran directly targeting U.S. forces, targeting U.S. partners in the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4qIemfFWw&t=108.68s)]
*  Middle East, including Israel. And the sooner the U.S. continues to stand back, assist [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4qIemfFWw&t=114.36000000000001s)]
*  Iran, give them money, whatever Biden's doing, it's a complete dangerous escalation of what [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4qIemfFWw&t=119.36000000000001s)]
*  could potentially happen in the region. We're up against a heartbreak. You've got [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4qIemfFWw&t=124.0s)]
*  15 seconds for you. Are we closer to the end of Israel's war against Hamas, closer [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4qIemfFWw&t=126.84s)]
*  to the end, or closer to the beginning? I think we're closer to the end, but the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4qIemfFWw&t=132.32s)]
*  problem is Biden put the handcuffs, him and his team put the handcuffs on Israel, and [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4qIemfFWw&t=135.96s)]
*  they slowed them down. They said they want more selectivity, they want more intelligence-driven [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4qIemfFWw&t=140.04000000000002s)]
*  operations targeted with more control over the civilian casualties. Trace, we're at war. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4qIemfFWw&t=143.24s)]
*  It's a war in Israel. People get killed. It's very unfortunate. However, Israel's doing [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4qIemfFWw&t=149.76000000000002s)]
*  the best it can, but I think that Israel's at about the 50-yard line, if I had to guess. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4qIemfFWw&t=154.0s)]
*  Bringing breaking news and great stuff as always, Aaron Cohen, thank you. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4qIemfFWw&t=158.56s)]
