# This could be the most difficult fighting Israel has faced: Michael Glover
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik)
*  Joining me now retired Brigadier General Anthony Tata and former Special Forces Sergeant Major Michael Glover. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=0.0s)]
*  All right, Tata, this is it. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=6.24s)]
*  Yeah, Roger, that Jesse. Great to be with you. They're developing the intelligence. They've been doing intelligence preparation of the battlefield. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=11.08s)]
*  And it seems like they've identified the key areas that they need to go. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=19.36s)]
*  They've they've actually brought in some envelopment there. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=23.8s)]
*  You saw with the naval forces and and this team has apparently developed a very clear picture of where the enemy is. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  Obviously, below the hospital, they want to know where the civilians are. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=38.6s)]
*  They want to know where the hostages are. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=41.76s)]
*  And, you know, it's a Ph.D. level problem with the three dimensional battlefield of high rises, the rubble in the streets and and certainly the tunnels that you mentioned. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=43.76s)]
*  So this this is something that took some time to develop that battlefield picture. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=53.28s)]
*  And now they've been able to move their logistics into place and they want to get into Gaza and and take enough terrain, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=60.48s)]
*  tighten up their logistics and make sure they have 360 degree security because those tunnels go everywhere. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=68.32s)]
*  They don't know where they all are. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=74.96s)]
*  And what they don't want to do is get so deep into Gaza that they they envelop themselves when Hamas comes out the backside. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=76.6s)]
*  So it seems to me that Israel is taking the time that they need to develop this picture and now get after it in a way that they can be successful. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=85.72s)]
*  As Netanyahu said, which is to destroy Hamas and Glover, when the infantry makes this first contact with the enemy on the ground, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=96.60000000000001s)]
*  what kind of intelligence picture are they going to get immediately? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=106.4s)]
*  Well, it's called sensitive site exploitation, basically taking evidence right off the bad guys. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=111.4s)]
*  Look, the worst of the bad guys are the terrorists and Hamas is the worst of the worst. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=117.28s)]
*  These guys are the guys that carried all their operational plans on their kit when they attacked Israel and killed 1400 plus civilians. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=122.96s)]
*  So that sensitive site exploitation, that SSC on the ground is going to be very important because it's going to it's going to create a better picture, a more refined picture. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=131.48s)]
*  Like the general said, operational preparation of the environment has been taking place. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=141.2s)]
*  But now they're going to be flexing target to target, gathering intel off the battlefield and potentially giving them a more refined picture of where these hostages are. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=145.8s)]
*  And so Glover, when they're in there, are they mostly facing sniper fire? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=154.4s)]
*  I mean, is mostly is going to be a defensive posture by Hamas. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=158.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it's going to be that that urban warfare block the block. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=165.12s)]
*  They're going to be using snipers. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=171.2s)]
*  They're going to be using RPGs. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=172.6s)]
*  They're going to be using ambushes, improvised explosives. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=174.76s)]
*  If they're backed by Iran like they are backed by Iran, you're going to see similar tactics used that were used against us in Iraq. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=177.68s)]
*  And, yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if it's some of the difficult, most difficult fighting that Israel has ever faced. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=185.4s)]
*  And Tata, were you surprised with this naval action, this assault from the south? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=190.68s)]
*  Did you see that coming? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=196.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, I'm not surprised by anything the IDF does because they're very innovative. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=198.08s)]
*  They're very creative. They have good leadership. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=203.36s)]
*  And to me, the pause that everybody was wondering what was happening, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=205.56s)]
*  I knew that they would be coming up with something creative to be able to maneuver and get the enemy fixed, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=210.72s)]
*  focused away from just the northern border of Gaza with Israel. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=218.12s)]
*  And, you know, why not what Hezbollah is doing to Israel, making them look in two directions, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=223.24s)]
*  why not force Hamas to look in multiple directions and get them off balance? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=228.76000000000002s)]
*  I think it's a creative way to start this. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=234.20000000000002s)]
*  It seems like they're getting a good set and they'll be able to have two fronts, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=236.92000000000002s)]
*  which is a good thing, as long as they can keep the logistics coming in from the from the sea. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=242.0s)]
*  All right, gentlemen, thank you guys so much. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=247.12s)]
*  And catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=253.08s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7duTc4WxJik&t=258.04s)]
