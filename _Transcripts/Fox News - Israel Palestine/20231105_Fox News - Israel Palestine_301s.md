# Saudi Prince reacts to Hezbollah leader: 'Axis of Resistance' is a big lie
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY)
*  And now this news. Don't think the Arab world is still all aligned against Israel. They are not. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=0.0s)]
*  Case in point. Saudi Prince Bin Masood in a major speech just hours ago saying this about [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=4.32s)]
*  Hassan Nasrallah's remarks yesterday. He runs Hezbollah saying this. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=10.24s)]
*  There is no doubt that the axis of resistance is a big lie. That's what Nasrallah referred to [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  yesterday. The hundred thousand missiles and massive weapons that Hezbollah has have nothing [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  to do with supporting the Palestinian cause. The so-called axis of resistance has been dealing [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=25.12s)]
*  with the Palestinian issue for years and is only a means of implementing Iran's agenda in the region. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=30.16s)]
*  No kidding. I cannot believe Saudi Arabia is saying this out loud. For the latest on that, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=35.84s)]
*  an Israel's assault on Gaza. Let's bring on Major Doran Spielman. He's the international [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  spokesperson for the Israeli Defense Forces. Nice to see you. Thanks for joining us. Your [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=46.16s)]
*  reaction to the Saudis remarks. Thank you for having me. I think that they are right on. I [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=51.6s)]
*  think that this is quite clear that what this is about is not peace. It's not providing peace for [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=59.6s)]
*  Palestinians, for Gazans or Israelis. There is no discussion here of trying to come to some type of [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=66.08s)]
*  agreement that is going to further humanity in any way. What this is about from Hamas is a cult [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=73.04s)]
*  of death. It is about death. It is about destruction. Like your previous speakers show when it says, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=79.2s)]
*  from the river to the sea, this is not about some type of equitable settlement. This is only about [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=85.04s)]
*  destroying the Jewish people and the state of Israel. And I think Saudi Arabia's statement is [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  directly on the money. They're the ones who are seeing the truth. It's those masses of people [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  you're showing in these screens. It breaks my heart because these people may not realize it, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=101.92s)]
*  but they're playing directly into Hamas's hands. Major, I understand today just to talk about the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=107.04s)]
*  fight specifically. Hezbollah hit you guys with a few rockets and you had your biggest border [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=111.36000000000001s)]
*  skirmish in 17 years. At which point you also put photographs of the locations of their missile [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=116.0s)]
*  sites. How serious is this northern front getting for you? Look, Hezbollah is a serious, serious [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=122.48s)]
*  threat. You're talking, you know, if Hamas is a bloody murderous regime that's trying to destroy [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=132.16s)]
*  the state of Israel, Hezbollah is really the largest terror army in the entire world. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=137.28s)]
*  They've been around and financed by around for years. They've killed hundreds of Americans, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=142.88s)]
*  including before 9-11, Hezbollah had killed more Americans than any other group. And so any other [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  terror group. You're talking about a fierce enemy. We're taking it very seriously. And they're trying, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=154.32s)]
*  on one hand to join Hamas and on the other hand, they're trying to be careful. But when they [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  threaten us, we're hitting them back hard. They have to understand any threat is going to be [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=164.24s)]
*  responded to enormously by Israel. We're not going to allow any danger to our population. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=170.16s)]
*  And at the same time, we've said to the people of Lebanon, which is where Hezbollah is based, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=175.44s)]
*  why would you want to put your future in the hands of Hezbollah who is rooting for Hamas, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=180.24s)]
*  which is essentially ISIS? And actually some of the Lebanese from Southern Lebanon are actually [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=186.0s)]
*  beginning to move out of the way because they realize they don't want to be partnered with ISIS. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=192.08s)]
*  But we're looking for an answer, a much larger answer, and to push Hezbollah to the point at [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=196.56s)]
*  which they know not to enter into a foray with Israel. Real quick, Major, and by the way, anytime [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=201.52s)]
*  there's a civilian casualty, that is something you are against. When there's a civilian casualty with [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=206.64s)]
*  Hamas, that is something they cheer. They put babies in ovens. There's no equal proportion here. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=211.92s)]
*  And I'm just going to bring up one last question. I hear you're going to go to a major hostage [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=217.83999999999997s)]
*  rescue mode. You've gotten a lot of intelligence, and we should look for that in the next couple [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=223.44s)]
*  of days. Would you confirm or deny that? I obviously cannot give away operational [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  details that would further our enemies who are, you know, for them the hostages, just like the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=234.39999999999998s)]
*  residents of Gaza, Hamas looks at these people not as human beings, literally only as bargaining [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=239.44s)]
*  chips. You know, we're looking basically at a play that they set in advance. How would they get away [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=245.35999999999999s)]
*  with murder was the question they asked themselves, and they realized hostages and civilians in Gaza [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=249.68s)]
*  are the only way that they can get away with murder. We clearly are absolutely committed to [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=255.6s)]
*  bringing those hostages home. We're also committed to trying, as you said, not to kill Gaza civilians. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=261.36s)]
*  Hamas are an evil actor, and they're trying to do both. You've sent thousands of millions of [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=267.2s)]
*  text messages to tell them where to go and how to get out. You've dropped flyers to tell them [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=271.84s)]
*  where to go and how to get out. They put their soldiers in ambulances, and they wonder why you [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=275.84s)]
*  hit the ambulances. Major, stay safe, keep fighting, and get this total complete victory. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=280.96s)]
*  Appreciate it. Thank you so much. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffwj14t9PyY&t=287.2s)]
