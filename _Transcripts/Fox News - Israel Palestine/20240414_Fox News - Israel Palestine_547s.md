# If you turn the other cheek, you get it in the neck with Iran: John Kennedy
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA)
*  All right joining us now Republican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana senator welcome back to Fox News Sunday [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=0.0s)]
*  Okay, so your response to to the the calls by listen there are Democrats and Republicans and you heard Admiral Kirby say that they [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=9.16s)]
*  Want that Senate package to get done the speaker hasn't moved it in the house [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=15.44s)]
*  What's your message to both of these bicameral institutions today? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=19.38s)]
*  Well, I think my position is pretty clear [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=26.48s)]
*  I [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=30.64s)]
*  Love Israel. I [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=32.2s)]
*  despise Putin I [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=34.24s)]
*  despise the Communist Party of China and I despise the Ayatollah in Iran I [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=36.28s)]
*  Don't want America to be the world's policeman [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=43.28s)]
*  But I don't want those guys to be the world's policeman either and with with those guys if you turn the other cheek [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=47.28s)]
*  You just get it in the neck [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=55.28s)]
*  More sheep is not going to solve the wolf problem. I expect I don't know but I expect the Speaker of the House [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=58.48s)]
*  Probably next week to put an Israel bill Israel support bill on the floor of the house [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=67.84s)]
*  I think it will be followed by a bill to support [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=72.78s)]
*  Taiwan and the Indo-Pacific and number three. I think he will [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=78.32s)]
*  Put a bill to support Ukraine now, I think his bill is going to make the money alone alone [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=83.16000000000001s)]
*  Llan I [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=90.56s)]
*  think it will [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=92.4s)]
*  Require [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=95.16s)]
*  Ukraine to pay it back. I think we will seize some Russian assets to pay for it [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=96.76s)]
*  I think the bill will be limited to military aid not humanitarian aid [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=101.76s)]
*  And I think there will be some strong encouragement to make Europe [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=106.88000000000001s)]
*  Which is vastly more wealthy [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=112.86s)]
*  Than than Russia to do a better job of putting its money where its mouth is and I think the bill will pass [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=115.62s)]
*  it'll come back to the Senate and [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=122.98s)]
*  Unfortunately, I predict that if it comes back to the Senate the big issue [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=126.06s)]
*  On those bills will not be correct of Ukraine. The big issue will be Israel [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=131.26s)]
*  Because it is clear that [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=137.14s)]
*  President Biden is is being influenced by the Hamas wing of the Democratic Party [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=139.57999999999998s)]
*  Well to that point you've got Senator Sanders there [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=145.9s)]
*  One of your colleagues who says in a piece in the Boston Globe this week [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=150.22s)]
*  He said not another nickel to not Yahoo [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=153.9s)]
*  He says does America want to be on the side of history of standing with people who are child killers and creating starvation? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=156.85999999999999s)]
*  I mean those are his words. He seems determined to block anything going to Israel [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=164.34s)]
*  Yes, and in the past 60 days we have seen President Biden [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=171.02s)]
*  go wobbly into his in his support of Israel and [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=177.42000000000002s)]
*  Today the White House has already leaked to the press early this morning that they're not going to participate in [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=182.02s)]
*  an Israeli response to what Iran just did [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=189.5s)]
*  Now, let me say it again [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=194.5s)]
*  More sheep is not going to solve the wolf problem my advice to the president today for what it's worth [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=196.5s)]
*  Mr. President don't [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=202.66s)]
*  Stop it [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=205.42000000000002s)]
*  support Israel [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=207.06s)]
*  With respect go to Amazon and buy a spine online [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=208.86s)]
*  Peace through weakness never works not with these hard hard being [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=214.7s)]
*  What about the issue of Rafa and the fact that there are more than a million civilians many of them are refugees from other [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=220.22s)]
*  Areas within Israel they were told to evacuate their they're there now [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=225.98s)]
*  We know that Hamas uses them as human shields, but the fact is they're there [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=229.66s)]
*  You know the US is weighing in on this. We are costing them. We are also indicating [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=235.1s)]
*  We're not going to be supportive of a mission there [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=239.18s)]
*  Israel says getting to Hamas is you know extinguishing an existential threat for them, but what are we to do? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=242.18s)]
*  About the civilian population caught in the middle of this thing [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=248.98s)]
*  Move them into the Sinai Peninsula [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=253.98s)]
*  Now that would require the consent of Egypt [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=258.14s)]
*  We send billions of dollars a year and aid to to Egypt [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=261.98s)]
*  Egypt gets billions of dollars of free money from the International Monetary Fund [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=268.5s)]
*  that America controls [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=275.3s)]
*  We need to sit down with it with Egypt and say we're moving the refugees [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=278.86s)]
*  Into Sinai and we're going to do to Hamas what we did to ISIS and al-qaeda [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=284.82s)]
*  Egypt will not like it [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=293.5s)]
*  But I think Egypt will understand why we're insisting on them doing that now if [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=296.22s)]
*  If the refugees don't want to move that is their choice [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=303.98s)]
*  But there is a simple answer to this if we just show a little bit of [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=308.66s)]
*  Fortitude well, we know Egypt would not be for that plane as you said they're not gonna like it. We'll see what? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=315.14s)]
*  measure of [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=321.94s)]
*  There because they feel that it may actually violate a treaty they've got with Israel [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=324.22s)]
*  But let me get to this the UN Security Council is going to meet this afternoon not known for being pro-israel [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=328.78s)]
*  What do you expect to see there this afternoon? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=334.82s)]
*  Lot of blah blah blah [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=339.42s)]
*  Probably our State Department will go along with it [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=342.94s)]
*  Look our State Department [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=346.62s)]
*  They're pretty good at diplomacy and they're pretty good at haggling over language [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=348.66s)]
*  At a UN summit, but they're not good for much more [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=354.74s)]
*  They we're in a we're in a bar fight here and the set the State Department wants to [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=362.02s)]
*  quote Plato and Socrates and read Beowulf in [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=368.9s)]
*  The last 60 days they've already gone wobbly and their support of Israel. The president says it's ironclad [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=373.62s)]
*  Come on man. The American people may be poorer under Biden, but they're not stupid. We need to stand with Israel [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=381.46s)]
*  It's very clear. We're not at war with Hamas [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=389.9s)]
*  Israel not a war with Hamas or Hezbollah or Yemen. Those are all surrogates [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=394.34s)]
*  For for Iran, those are their prostitutes. The pimp is Iran [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=400.06s)]
*  Israel is a war with Iran Iran hates Americans Iran hates Jews [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=405.34s)]
*  Iran wants to kill Americans and Jews [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=412.58s)]
*  And if we turn the other cheek to them, we're gonna get it in the neck [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=416.54s)]
*  All right [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=421.3s)]
*  I want to ask you quickly too because there's talk about my opinion whether you guys will move aid this week [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=421.86s)]
*  But you also are expected to receive now with everything that's happening [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=426.58s)]
*  This may have changed but the house sending over articles of impeachment [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=430.02s)]
*  For Secretary Marikas with respect to the border Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer says it it's absurd. The house hasn't proved anything [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=432.82s)]
*  He's gonna get rid of it very quickly. I know you feel differently about that [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=439.5s)]
*  Well, the United States House of Representatives has impeached a cabinet official made serious charges after a thorough investigation [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=443.38s)]
*  As I said last week, we're not talking about about some snowbroke [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=451.7s)]
*  Who eats chicken mcdouggets and smokes weeds and has an opinion? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=456.54s)]
*  This is the United States House of Representatives in the past 200 plus years [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=460.58s)]
*  We've had 21 impeachments by the United States House of Representatives [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=465.82s)]
*  We've always held a trial in the Senate unless the impeached official quit we ought to do it now [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=469.82s)]
*  Senator Schumer is coming up with all kind of excuses [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=475.82s)]
*  And and and and talking about how many lawyers can dance on the head of a pen [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=479.82s)]
*  He's trying to muddy the water to make it look deep. It's not deep. It's simple [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=485.82s)]
*  He doesn't want to have to be impeached [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=490.86s)]
*  He doesn't want to have the United States Senate examine [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=494.82s)]
*  Secretary Mayorkas's and President Biden's open border policy that the American people are so upset about [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=498.82s)]
*  And that's not a good reason to violate 200 years of precedent [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=507.82s)]
*  My advice to Senator Schumer is same as to the president don't follow Senate precedent [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=511.82s)]
*  Same as to the president don't follow Senate precedent [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=518.82s)]
*  Let's stop the Senate from from rotting from within [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=522.82s)]
*  Well, we'll see if that makes it onto the calendar [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=527.82s)]
*  Senator, thank you. Always good to see you [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=530.82s)]
*  Thank you, Shane [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZO2GJHSufA&t=534.82s)]
