# Biden slammed by OK, TX governors visiting Israel hospital
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E)
*  Let's go to the governors of Texas and Oklahoma who are in Tel Aviv right now, Greg Abbott [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=0.0s)]
*  and Kevin Stitt respectively. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=7.68s)]
*  Governors, thank you. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=9.6s)]
*  Why are you there? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=11.48s)]
*  Do you, Governor Abbott, first? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=12.48s)]
*  Listen, we're here to send a message, and that is the state of Texas and the state of [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=14.48s)]
*  Oklahoma. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  And the United States of America, we stand with Israel. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  We are very concerned about misinformation across the globe about what's happening on [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=23.64s)]
*  the ground here. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=29.04s)]
*  Listen, we just talked to victims in a hospital here in Tel Aviv who looked in the eye quite [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=30.04s)]
*  literally of evil, of their attackers who are trying to eliminate them because they [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=36.44s)]
*  are Jewish. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=41.36s)]
*  Attackers who are so bad that they threw hand grenades into medical tents, hand grenades [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=43.36s)]
*  into ambulances. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  They care about one thing these terrorists do, the Hamas terrorists. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=53.84s)]
*  They care about killing Jewish people. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=56.64s)]
*  That must end in the United States. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=59.88s)]
*  We need a Biden administration who's going to step up and provide the robust support [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=62.36s)]
*  that's needed to wipe Hamas off the face of the map. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=67.28s)]
*  You know, Governor Stitt, this occurs though with a backdrop, Governor Stitt, where getting [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=72.36s)]
*  aid to Israel might be stymied in the House. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=76.98s)]
*  They had the aid only Israel first package that they want to make sure is paid for before [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=80.12s)]
*  they get it out there. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=86.18s)]
*  How do you feel about that? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=87.18s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=88.18s)]
*  When we're talking about spending $900 billion in our defense budget and a portion of that [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=89.18s)]
*  going to fight this pure evil, it's going to come to Europe next. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=96.18s)]
*  It's going to come to the U.S. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=101.62s)]
*  But I want Oklahomans, I want Texans, I want Americans to understand basically there are [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=102.98s)]
*  3,000 very organized terrorist military groups that entered into their country and mowed [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=107.34s)]
*  women and children down. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=116.02000000000001s)]
*  We just heard the stories. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=118.26s)]
*  Governor Navid and I are in the hospital right now with 23-year-old girls that were inside [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=120.14s)]
*  a bomb shelter as grenades were launched in on them. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=125.10000000000001s)]
*  So if this happened on U.S. soil, we would be fired up and we would absolutely go after [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=129.46s)]
*  these terrorist groups. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=136.4s)]
*  And so this is nonsense. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=138.52s)]
*  This is pure evil. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=141.24s)]
*  And we need to fight this war. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=142.84s)]
*  We need to make sure that Israel has the support of their biggest ally, and that's the United [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=144.76000000000002s)]
*  States of America. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  Governor Abbott, you've been dealing with, obviously, a migrant surge of enormous proportions. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  And FBI Director Bray, as well as other top U.S. intelligence officials, fear that among [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=158.12s)]
*  those sneaking in are those who could harm us and maybe take some inspiration from what [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=163.96s)]
*  Hamas did to Israel a few weeks ago and do it here. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=169.68s)]
*  How do you feel about that? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  Listen, Neil, we're extraordinarily concerned about it. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  Let's be clear about one thing, and that is four years ago, we had the lowest illegal [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=179.92s)]
*  border crossings in 40 years. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=184.24s)]
*  When Joe Biden came into office, however, he eliminated all of those good policies, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=186.92s)]
*  and now we have open border policies where this past year 2.4 million people were apprehended [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=191.64s)]
*  coming across the border illegally. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=197.48s)]
*  As you know, Neil, that includes the highest number ever of people who are on the terrorist [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=199.72s)]
*  watch list. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  We're extraordinarily concerned about terrorists in our country. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=206.88s)]
*  The top job of the Commander in Chief is national security. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=210.35999999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden is failing at national security because he's not keeping potential terrorists [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=214.0s)]
*  out of our country. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=219.07999999999998s)]
*  The FBI Director Ray, nor the President, have any idea whether or not there is somebody [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=221.60000000000002s)]
*  from Hamas roaming around the United States of America who could strike this kind of deadly [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=227.04000000000002s)]
*  attack on our own country. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=232.28s)]
*  We need a president who's going to step up and secure our entire country against dangerous [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  threats like Hamas. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=239.36s)]
*  Gentlemen, I know you have to go. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=240.60000000000002s)]
*  You've been on a busy tour there, get home safely, but the governors of Texas and Oklahoma, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=242.20000000000002s)]
*  respectively, Greg Abbott and Kevin Stitt. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=248.0s)]
*  Gentlemen, thank you again. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Goo7z8j1E&t=250.88s)]
