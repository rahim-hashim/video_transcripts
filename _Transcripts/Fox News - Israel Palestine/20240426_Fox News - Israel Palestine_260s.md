# Students hold pro-Israel march in New York City
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM)
*  You got it, of course. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's bring in Gideon Askowitz, who is a sophomore at Hunter College. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=1.0s)]
*  Gideon had a very busy night last night because he attended what's called the United for Israel [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=4.96s)]
*  March. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  It took place near Columbia's campus, sort of ground zero for everything that's going [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  on in New York City right now. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=14.88s)]
*  Gideon, what was that like? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=16.28s)]
*  So there was a mix of different things that we saw there. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=18.34s)]
*  We had a really nice outpouring of support from Christian supporters, from people from [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=21.02s)]
*  the Phyllis Project, from people throughout the entire state who came to show up and support [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=25.36s)]
*  the Columbia Jewish students. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=29.64s)]
*  And then we had a lot of agitators who were holding up signs that were quite frightening. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=31.360000000000003s)]
*  They had different messages on them, such as, from New York City to Palestine, there [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=36.260000000000005s)]
*  will be liberation, which is not exactly a warm statement if we understand what liberation [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  in Palestine means, the murder of Jews. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=47.28s)]
*  And we had a lot of different things like that. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=49.88s)]
*  One protester was arrested for attempting to assault someone. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=51.56s)]
*  So some good, some bad. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=54.56s)]
*  A mixed bag. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=56.160000000000004s)]
*  So you, after you attended United for Israel, you went over to City College, and you visited [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=57.4s)]
*  a pro-Palestinian encampment now. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=63.0s)]
*  There's encampments on all these college campuses. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=65.92s)]
*  This is video that you shot while you were at City College. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=68.32s)]
*  Explain what we're seeing right here. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=72.4s)]
*  Yeah, so what we're seeing in that video is me approaching the encampment there just [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=73.64s)]
*  with my phone out, me by myself as a very Orthodox presenting, Orthodox Jewish presenting [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  individual. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=83.72s)]
*  And they immediately approached me, found out who I was, and they carried that information [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=84.72s)]
*  to what is essentially a command node in the center of that encampment of about 200, 250 [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=88.6s)]
*  students. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=93.08s)]
*  And they instantly started blaring music. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=94.08s)]
*  They surrounded me. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=95.96s)]
*  They had very threatening messaging directly toward me. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=97.26s)]
*  They said that they were going to beat me up. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=101.12s)]
*  They then shoved me very violently and hid the person who shoved me. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=103.28s)]
*  My yarmulke, my Jewish cap fell off onto the floor, and they dared me to pick it up in a [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=106.8s)]
*  very threatening manner. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=111.6s)]
*  Why did you go to the pro-Palestinian encampment? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=113.12s)]
*  So I have a cousin, actually, who goes to that school, and I wanted to check it out [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  for myself and see what it would be like for her. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=118.4s)]
*  She also presents very openly Orthodox, and I was frightened what that would mean for [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=120.2s)]
*  her when school resumes. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=125.32s)]
*  Are you having any reasonable conversations with pro-Palestinian students? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=126.8s)]
*  So out of the 200 people there, there were two people there that were somewhat normal. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=131.07999999999998s)]
*  One of them actually was kind enough to help pick up my kippah, and he escorted me out. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=135.68s)]
*  He said, listen, it's just not safe here. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=140.16s)]
*  If that's the reality, if they're saying it's not safe here for you and the schools [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=142.24s)]
*  aren't doing anything about it, that's an issue. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, listen, we have a lot of messages coming in. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=147.76s)]
*  One of the most important is from our current president, and he recently was asked about [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=149.84s)]
*  how he feels about all this. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=154.56s)]
*  He says he condemns anti-Semitism, but he also condemns those who don't understand [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=155.96s)]
*  what's going on with the Palestinians. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=161.56s)]
*  He played both sides. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=163.6s)]
*  How do you feel about that? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=165.32s)]
*  So in some respects, I'm quite sympathetic. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=166.72s)]
*  I feel terrible for what's happening to their innocent Palestinians who are being [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  killed, and I feel very bad for them. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=172.2s)]
*  What we also see, however, is students who are openly threatening Jewish students, and [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=173.64s)]
*  they do so oftentimes in the name of Islam. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=179.07999999999998s)]
*  We had students, as soon as I left that encampment, they started chanting hadith and Quran on [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=181.76s)]
*  their loudspeakers. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=186.35999999999999s)]
*  So, you know, there's definitely a mixed bag on that, I would say, and I've had, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=187.35999999999999s)]
*  in fact, at City College campus, the Islamic students there, they're different organizations [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=192.12s)]
*  called All the Jews Murderers, and they did the same thing at Hunter College. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=196.08s)]
*  So mixed bag there. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=199.48000000000002s)]
*  Gideon, how is this going to end? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  What's going to happen? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=202.08s)]
*  It'll end. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=203.08s)]
*  And what needs to happen? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=204.08s)]
*  I know that you're calling for congressional action of some kind. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=205.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=207.4s)]
*  So what we need to see from Congress is a couple of things. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=208.4s)]
*  We need to see Congress actually have the attorney general enforce the laws on the books, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=210.28s)]
*  which makes it a deportable offense for people to endorse terrorism. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=214.96s)]
*  It's currently illegal to do that. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=218.04000000000002s)]
*  We need them to adopt the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=219.52s)]
*  We need Congress to withhold funding from institutions that can't maintain a proper [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=222.98s)]
*  educational environment. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=227.85999999999999s)]
*  U.S. taxpayers should not be going to schools that can't maintain the safety for Jewish [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=228.85999999999999s)]
*  students and can't maintain an educational environment for anybody. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=234.01999999999998s)]
*  Well, you were our eyes and ears last night looking and experiencing both sides of this [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=237.1s)]
*  fiery debate. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=242.95999999999998s)]
*  So we thank you so much for joining us to tell us what you saw and experienced. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=243.95999999999998s)]
*  Thank you, Gideon. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=247.66s)]
*  Gideon, ask away. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=248.66s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=249.66s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=250.66s)]
*  And I'm Ainsley Earhart. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=251.66s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl01CXuUSBM&t=252.66s)]
