# If Trump were still president, none of this would be happening: Sen. Graham
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0)
*  Let's start with Lindsey Graham. Senator, great to see you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you, Brian. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=2.5s)]
*  So you talked to the President Trump recently. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=3.5s)]
*  Yeah, I talked to him last night. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=5.22s)]
*  Is he upset about this job? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=6.22s)]
*  Well, yeah, he feels, you know, it just, he believes it's political. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=7.78s)]
*  Bottom line is no bank. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=12.700000000000001s)]
*  It is, though. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=13.700000000000001s)]
*  Well, yeah, but no bank got defrauded. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=14.700000000000001s)]
*  I mean, the banks are not in court saying, you know, hold Trump accountable. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=16.3s)]
*  I lost money. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=20.1s)]
*  They're not saying that there's no victim here. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=21.22s)]
*  And if you think Mar-a-Lago's worth $18 million, you shouldn't be allowed to drive. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=23.54s)]
*  They doubled down on it. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=27.68s)]
*  They doubled down on it again. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=29.08s)]
*  And they said that, well, it's whatever reason, it doesn't really matter. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=30.48s)]
*  This is one thing that's pretty clear. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=34.96s)]
*  That if they want to target you, they can target you. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  Oh, totally. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=39.879999999999995s)]
*  I mean, in civil court, they're trying to take him down and make him and take his properties [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  and put it in receivership. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  I have been on most of his properties that I know of, and they're all first class. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  I mean, the bottom line is this is an effort by a Democratic attorney general to make a [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=50.8s)]
*  name for herself. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=55.32s)]
*  She promised to get Trump before she got elected. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=56.62s)]
*  And she's trying. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  And this is not hurting Trump. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=60.199999999999996s)]
*  Where I live in South Carolina, you know, being attacked by the attorney general in [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  New York doesn't hurt you one bit in South Carolina. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=65.84s)]
*  President Trump will win the primary in my state. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=69.24s)]
*  So let me give you an idea. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=71.6s)]
*  Let's see what happens in Iowa. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=73.0s)]
*  Do you think it matters that Governor Reynolds will be endorsing Governor DeSantis? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=74.9s)]
*  Well, I think it's a good get for DeSantis. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=79.4s)]
*  I'm not running against anybody. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=81.56s)]
*  I'm just for Trump. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=83.12s)]
*  Why am I for Trump? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=84.12s)]
*  I believe that Donald Trump were president of the United States. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=85.22s)]
*  None of this would be happening. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=88.34s)]
*  None. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=90.06s)]
*  There would be no attack by Hamas against Israel. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=91.06s)]
*  I believe if he got elected tomorrow, most of this would end pretty quickly because people [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=93.42s)]
*  are afraid of him. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=97.26s)]
*  So, yeah, I think it will probably help DeSantis. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=98.26s)]
*  But the Trump voter is locked in. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=100.94s)]
*  I can tell you right now, Trump is over 50 percent of my state. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=103.26s)]
*  You have Iowa, you have New Hampshire, you have South Carolina, Nevada. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=106.74000000000001s)]
*  By February the 24th, I think it is. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=110.9s)]
*  I think this primary will be over by the end of February. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=113.12s)]
*  So this Times poll, Siena poll, Siena is a small college in upstate Albany, and it usually [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  tilts left. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=123.0s)]
*  That's what this is so jarring to so many Democrats because right now, Trump beats Biden [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=124.92s)]
*  head-to-head nationally, 51-47. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=128.96s)]
*  He's ahead in every battleground state on almost every issue. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=131.48000000000002s)]
*  In Pennsylvania, Trump over Biden, 59-37. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=135.84s)]
*  In Wisconsin, 52-40. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=139.48s)]
*  Oh, excuse me, that's on the economy. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=141.66s)]
*  But overall, in his rankings, get this, when it comes to just head-to-head, in Nevada, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=144.54s)]
*  Trump up. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=151.17999999999998s)]
*  In Georgia, Trump up by six. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=152.17999999999998s)]
*  In Arizona, Trump up by five. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=154.04s)]
*  In Michigan, Trump up by five. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=156.62s)]
*  Pennsylvania, Trump up by four. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=158.7s)]
*  Wisconsin, he trails by two. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=160.78s)]
*  These are better polls than he had against Hillary Clinton. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=163.22s)]
*  Well, I think the American people have had enough with Joe Biden. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=164.98s)]
*  He's a nice man, but he doesn't know what he's doing on multiple fronts. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=168.68s)]
*  Gas is high, groceries are high, the border's completely broken, nobody respects us in the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=172.6s)]
*  world. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=178.64s)]
*  The world's on fire on multiple fronts. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=179.64s)]
*  So I think people feel the country's going in the wrong direction. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=181.26s)]
*  Why would you vote for the same guy if you think it's going in the wrong direction? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=184.96s)]
*  This is Trump's election to lose. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=190.64s)]
*  Right now, things going badly in America. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=193.34s)]
*  In January, 65%. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=195.88s)]
*  Now 73%. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=198.1s)]
*  This is the highest in your lifetime. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=200.62s)]
*  Well, who are the 27% that like what's going on? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=202.1s)]
*  Who are they? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=205.38s)]
*  You know what's crazy is that, do you know the environmentalists, the green? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=206.38s)]
*  They don't think that Joe Biden's gone far enough. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=211.38s)]
*  So what's happening is Joe Biden's presidency has been a disaster for the average person [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=214.01999999999998s)]
*  in America. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=219.54s)]
*  Grocers are high, gas is high, the streets are not safe. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=221.1s)]
*  The world is on fire. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=224.54s)]
*  Nobody feels safe. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=226.28s)]
*  We're living on bar time with a broken border. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=227.67999999999998s)]
*  There will be an effort by the Republicans to put a border security plan on the table [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=229.48s)]
*  starting this week as part of a package to help Ukraine and help Israel. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=233.64s)]
*  If we do not secure our border quickly and stop the flow, the invasion for lack of a [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=238.39999999999998s)]
*  better word, we're going to get hit here. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=243.73999999999998s)]
*  But the one thing, and I want to talk about the world, but I do want to end just so people [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=246.6s)]
*  understand whether you like Trump or not. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=250.39999999999998s)]
*  I don't think it's right that all the media will conspire to try to take him down. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=252.94s)]
*  They will not say Joe Biden should be reelected. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=256.14s)]
*  They say that Donald Trump is unelectable. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=258.3s)]
*  Case in point, last night on 60 Minutes, they led with John Eastman, January 6th again, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=260.82s)]
*  and then George Stephanopoulos yesterday asking Steve Scalise over and over again who won [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=267.82s)]
*  the 2020 election. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=273.65999999999997s)]
*  Listen to Jonathan Karl yesterday, cut 18. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=275.46s)]
*  One thing to consider here is, you know, Trump has been in the news over the last year or [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=279.1s)]
*  so based on these criminal cases, the civil case in New York, but people have not been [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=284.98s)]
*  paying attention to what Trump has become. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=290.58s)]
*  Trump, since he left the White House, and this is really the theme of my book, has become [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=294.06s)]
*  more detached from reality than he ever was even in the White House. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=299.5s)]
*  If you think of where we were in January of 2021, that's the starting point for where [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=303.46s)]
*  a Trump presidency would be next time around. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=309.44s)]
*  So I think he's had largely, believe it or not, a free ride. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=311.76s)]
*  Again, the criminal cases we know about. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=315.47999999999996s)]
*  But we have free ride. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=317.56s)]
*  Then he had a speech the other day in Texas where he referred to the people that are in [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=318.56s)]
*  prison because they attacked the U.S. Capitol as hostages. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=321.59999999999997s)]
*  And he goes on to say that he lost to Obama last time. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=324.88s)]
*  No, he keeps saying that he thinks Obama's running the White House. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=327.88s)]
*  So your thought, they're already saying that he's detached from reality. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=331.65999999999997s)]
*  Well, so these are journalists who are writing books telling you that Trump is unhinged. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=335.06s)]
*  That's not journalism. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=340.3s)]
*  That's advocacy. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=341.3s)]
*  You can be an advocate if you would like, but you can't be both. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=342.3s)]
*  You can't be writing a book saying that Donald Trump is delusional and at the same time cover [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=345.65999999999997s)]
*  the 2024 election fairly. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=351.06s)]
*  This is an effort by the media throughout the country to take Trump down, to make him [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=353.62s)]
*  unelectable because they're afraid of a second Trump. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=357.86s)]
*  What are they afraid of? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=360.88s)]
*  I think they're afraid that he will come back in office and he will undo all the crazy stuff [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=361.88s)]
*  that Biden has done. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=367.76s)]
*  I think the biggest fear for a liberal is that Trump is conservative, not that he's [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=368.76s)]
*  unhinged, that he literally is conservative and they want liberal policies. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=373.04s)]
*  Remember they tried to take around Mitt Romney and say he was a rich white guy. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=377.24s)]
*  Same thing with John McCain. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=379.92s)]
*  He was crazy, right? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=380.92s)]
*  John McCain, the bottom line here, folks, is that the media in this country, except [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=382.76s)]
*  for where I'm at right now, is pretty much in the hands of the Democratic Party. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=387.38s)]
*  They're all Democrats. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=391.38s)]
*  They want the Democratic agenda and that's what, and there's a backlash. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=392.38s)]
*  It's not working. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=396.54s)]
*  You know what's driving them crazy? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=397.54s)]
*  That Trump's leading. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=399.02000000000004s)]
*  They're doing everything they can to beat Trump. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=400.22s)]
*  Foreign debits. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=402.46000000000004s)]
*  But they can't make Biden presidency acceptable. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=403.46000000000004s)]
*  So what do they do? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=406.34000000000003s)]
*  If you can't sell Biden, you have to destroy Trump. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=407.34000000000003s)]
*  That's what's going on. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=409.74s)]
*  So Israel's at war. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=410.74s)]
*  The CIA director, Burns, visited Israel. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=411.74s)]
*  You know, the Secretary of Defense is on two or three times a day, it seems, with his [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=413.72s)]
*  counterpart over in Israel. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=417.90000000000003s)]
*  They dropped a 2,000-pound bomb, I think, on Saturday. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=419.5s)]
*  They are starting to show out video of the tunnels underneath hospitals, but they're [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=422.54s)]
*  not letting up. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=426.94000000000005s)]
*  But yet it seems as though the world pressure is to let up. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=429.18s)]
*  You saw 100,000 people in Washington, D.C. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=431.74s)]
*  Bring us inside the school of thought with the Israelis. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=434.34000000000003s)]
*  So here's what's happening. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=437.38000000000005s)]
*  Within four weeks, it's just been barely over a month that the largest killing of Jewish [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=439.71999999999997s)]
*  people since the Holocaust, simply because they're Jewish, occurred. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=445.4s)]
*  And you saw the video, right? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=450.12s)]
*  I saw not only the video, I saw more than the video. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=451.12s)]
*  There are things that have not been released that will...they outdid the Nazis, that's [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=455.15999999999997s)]
*  all I can say. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=459.4s)]
*  I spent time with the Israeli defense minister. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=460.4s)]
*  They showed us stuff that you haven't seen and you probably don't need to see it. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=462.53999999999996s)]
*  The bottom line is, within four weeks, the world has turned on Israel. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=466.29999999999995s)]
*  Anti-Semitism is rampant throughout the world. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=470.26s)]
*  Back here at home, when somebody says, free Palestine from the river to the sea, they're [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=472.58s)]
*  advocating for the destruction of the Jewish people, Israel, as a sovereign nation. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=477.67999999999995s)]
*  That means that you're an anti-Semitic Nazi. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=484.05999999999995s)]
*  So when a member of Congress repeats the slogan, from the river to the sea, she is saying, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=486.26s)]
*  I want Israel destroyed because that would be the result of that policy. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=492.22s)]
*  That to me is anti-Semitism. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=496.32000000000005s)]
*  That's 2023 version of the Nazis. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=498.68s)]
*  And I can't believe we're living where...just end with this stuff. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=501.40000000000003s)]
*  There were people killed by Hamas that survived the Holocaust. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=504.92s)]
*  As young people, they survived being killed by the Germans because they were Jewish, only [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=510.1s)]
*  to be killed by radical Islamic terrorists in Israel at the end of their lives, toward [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=514.28s)]
*  the end of their lives. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=519.0400000000001s)]
*  How could the world let that happen? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=520.36s)]
*  How could we go from 80 years ago, the Warsaw uprising, ghetto uprising, to where Jews are [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=522.06s)]
*  killed in the state of Israel simply for being Jewish within an 80-year time span? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=528.76s)]
*  We've been attacked 32 times since October 7th in Iraq and in Syria. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=536.88s)]
*  Here's what...I'm going to use you to put you...just put it up to here. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=540.88s)]
*  Here's what Anthony Blinken said yesterday in...or Sunday in Baghdad, because in a surprise [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=543.64s)]
*  visit, cut 14. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=549.0s)]
*  There have been a series of attacks conducted by militia directed at our personnel, both [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=551.24s)]
*  in Iraq as well as in Syria. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=555.46s)]
*  Job number one for me is to ensure the security of our people, and so I got an update on everything [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=559.86s)]
*  we're doing to make sure that our personnel are safe and secure. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=564.7s)]
*  In addition, I had a good, productive candid meeting with Prime Minister al-Sadani. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=570.62s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=576.46s)]
*  I want to get your take on that response, because I'm thinking about the 2,500 in Iraq [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=577.46s)]
*  and the 900 in Syria, and they want to know if they're going to be able to defend themselves. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=581.74s)]
*  Well, number one, he said, I'm doing everything I can, Secretary Blinken, to make sure they're [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=585.3000000000001s)]
*  safe. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=589.78s)]
*  No, you're not. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=590.78s)]
*  If you're doing everything you could, you would communicate to the Iranians that any [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=591.78s)]
*  further attacks against our troops in Syria or Iraq by Shia militia controlled by the [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=595.1s)]
*  Iranians would result in an attack on Iran by U.S. forces. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=600.08s)]
*  We're moving the military capability in, but nobody believes we have the will to use it. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=603.68s)]
*  So what I'm begging the Biden administration to do is draw a red line. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=608.04s)]
*  Further attacks against our people in Syria and Iraq will result in attacks in Iran against [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=612.5s)]
*  the IRGC oil infrastructure. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=618.12s)]
*  If they believe we would hit them in Iran, they would stop this. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=621.4799999999999s)]
*  They believe that about Trump. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=625.66s)]
*  When Trump killed Soleimani, everything sort of fell in place. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=626.9599999999999s)]
*  We've lost deterrence. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=629.9599999999999s)]
*  How do you regain it? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=631.04s)]
*  You communicate red lines. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=632.04s)]
*  There are two red lines that should be communicated. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=633.1999999999999s)]
*  If Hezbollah attacks Israel in the north in a serious way, then we'll go on after the [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=635.7199999999999s)]
*  Iranians. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=641.0799999999999s)]
*  Is that what that submarine's there for with all the time hooks? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=642.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well, we've got everything in place. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=643.0799999999999s)]
*  You just got to be willing to use it. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=644.0799999999999s)]
*  Again, if Hezbollah launches a portion of their 100,000 rockets at Israel, that could [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=646.0799999999999s)]
*  be a nightmare for Israel. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=651.4s)]
*  You have our troops under siege in Syria and Iraq. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=653.04s)]
*  I would be communicating directly, openly what my red lines are to Iran and enforce [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=655.8399999999999s)]
*  them. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=661.4399999999999s)]
*  We're just lucky that one of our soldiers will be killed. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=662.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=664.32s)]
*  And by the way, there might have been because evidently one of the drones, one-way drones, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=665.32s)]
*  didn't go off. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=669.24s)]
*  We're just lucky. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=670.24s)]
*  So to all the family members who have loved ones in the Mideast, we owe it to you and [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=671.24s)]
*  your loved ones. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=675.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=676.36s)]
*  I mean, come on. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=677.36s)]
*  Every commander-in-chief should have the backs of troops in the field. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=678.36s)]
*  Why are they in Syria and Iraq? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=680.4000000000001s)]
*  What's the decision? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=681.4000000000001s)]
*  Is the Secretary of Defense usually empowered? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=682.4000000000001s)]
*  It's up to the President. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=684.2s)]
*  Yeah, but Austin, I ask him, you pull up the exchange. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=685.2s)]
*  When you say today to the world, it is a red line to kill an American soldier in Syria [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=690.32s)]
*  and Iraq, the Iranians keep attacking us through their proxies. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=694.88s)]
*  We're coming after them. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=698.44s)]
*  He would not say that. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=699.6800000000001s)]
*  It's really up to Biden. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=700.8000000000001s)]
*  So what we've lost here is deterrence. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=702.24s)]
*  Why are our soldiers in Iraq and Syria? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=704.44s)]
*  To prevent the rise of ISIS. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=706.4000000000001s)]
*  They're just not visiting Syria and Iraq. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=708.2s)]
*  They're there to protect us against an enemy that hit us when they had the caliphate. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=710.6s)]
*  They're there to make America safer. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=715.36s)]
*  Can you owe it to those people in Syria and Iraq to have their back? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=717.52s)]
*  I can say this. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=721.24s)]
*  The Biden administration is not being forceful enough to have the backs of those serving. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=722.8s)]
*  Does it remind you of anybody else? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=727.0s)]
*  President Obama. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=728.48s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=729.48s)]
*  When I read about Obama, we all have blame here. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=730.48s)]
*  President Obama was the weakest president in my lifetime when it came to the Mideast. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=733.56s)]
*  He withdrew all of our forces from Iraq. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=737.48s)]
*  We got ISIS. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=739.96s)]
*  ISIS ran wild in Syria and Iraq. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=740.96s)]
*  Missile defense out of Eastern Europe? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=744.04s)]
*  All I can say is he empowered the Iranians. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=746.1999999999999s)]
*  He withdrew all of our forces. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=749.52s)]
*  We got ISIS. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=750.92s)]
*  Turned out not to be the JV team. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=751.92s)]
*  He surged in Afghanistan, announced the withdrawal date at the same time he surged. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=753.8s)]
*  Terrorism was emboldened under his watch. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=759.4s)]
*  Putin went into Ukraine under his watch. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=761.1999999999999s)]
*  Biden is Obama 2.0 even weaker. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=763.9599999999999s)]
*  You just in Saudi Arabia? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=767.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=768.68s)]
*  So Prince, unpronounceable first name, Bin Masoud. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=769.68s)]
*  Just calling Prince. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=773.04s)]
*  Launched a sharp attack on the secretary general of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, after [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=774.04s)]
*  his speech. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=779.12s)]
*  There is no doubt, this is his quote, that the axis of resistance is a big lie. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=780.12s)]
*  The 100,000 missiles and massive weapons that Hezbollah has have nothing to do with supporting [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=784.4399999999999s)]
*  the Palestinian cause. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=789.0s)]
*  The so-called axis of resistance has been dealing with the Palestinian issue for years [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=790.4s)]
*  and only as means of implementing Iran's agenda. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=794.0s)]
*  My goodness, did I write that? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=797.12s)]
*  Sounds like, no. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=798.3199999999999s)]
*  First thing, I thought you were reading what I said. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=799.3199999999999s)]
*  So things have changed. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=801.24s)]
*  The Abraham Accords, where Arab nations recognized Israel under President Trump, was a breakthrough. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=802.8s)]
*  I am working with the Biden administration to do a deal between Saudi Arabia, the United [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=808.6s)]
*  States and Israel. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=812.68s)]
*  If we can pull the Arab world away from Iran and toward Israel and the United States, that's [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=813.68s)]
*  a big deal. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=818.92s)]
*  So what is the Saudi prince saying? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=820.1s)]
*  He's saying that Hamas is not a resistance organization. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=823.3199999999999s)]
*  But I was told you can't tell the truth because of the Arab street. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=826.28s)]
*  The Arab street will turn on you. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=829.2s)]
*  He did it. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=831.36s)]
*  The Arab street is pretty hot right now. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=832.36s)]
*  Like Turkey, what is this all about? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=834.36s)]
*  The PKK are terrorists. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=837.28s)]
*  I get that. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=838.48s)]
*  Well, Hamas, if you can't say Hamas is a terrorist group, you lost your way. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=839.48s)]
*  You declare war on Israel. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=842.16s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=843.64s)]
*  So the bottom line is the region is rejecting Hamas. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=845.2s)]
*  The destruction of Hamas is non-negotiable. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=849.5600000000001s)]
*  So the Arabs are making a bet, and we need to encourage this bet, that their life is [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=852.22s)]
*  right. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=859.52s)]
*  Rather than Iran, China and Russia. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=860.52s)]
*  And guess who the head of Hamas was visiting? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=862.4s)]
*  Iran. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=864.4s)]
*  Iran. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=865.4s)]
*  He went to Iran. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=866.4s)]
*  So they have 100,000 precision guided rockets in Hezbollah hands that could overwhelm Iron [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=867.4s)]
*  Dome. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=872.0s)]
*  If we do not communicate to Hezbollah and the militias in Syria and Iraq, what they [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=873.0s)]
*  can't do, they will do it. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=877.64s)]
*  They will not live another day if they do it. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=879.48s)]
*  They'll do tremendous destruction on Israel, but they're not going to survive. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=881.36s)]
*  No, they're not. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=885.0s)]
*  But I want to go to Iran. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=886.0s)]
*  Hamas is supported by Iran. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=887.8s)]
*  Hezbollah is supported by Iran. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=889.8s)]
*  The Shiite militias get their money from the Iranians. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=891.64s)]
*  The great Satan is Iran. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=894.2s)]
*  I hear you. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=896.36s)]

*  You help me out with Frederick Douglass and Lincoln. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AEDuHkKvA0&t=908.48s)]
