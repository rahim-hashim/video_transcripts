# ‘NIGHTMARE SCENARIO’: Three Hamas hostages mistakenly killed by IDF
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4)
*  All right, we, as we just reported a few moments ago, just got word from the IDF that the Israeli [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=0.0s)]
*  military says it has mistakenly killed three Israeli hostages during its ground operation [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=7.68s)]
*  in the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=14.48s)]
*  They said that during combat the IDF mistakenly identified those hostages as a threat and [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=16.56s)]
*  as a result the troops fired toward them and they were killed. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=22.02s)]
*  Victoria Coats is joining us now. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=25.6s)]
*  She joins us by phone. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=27.28s)]
*  The IDF, Victoria, said during their searches and checks in the area in which the incident [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=29.12s)]
*  occurred a suspicion rose over the identities of the deceased. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  Their bodies were transferred to Israeli territory for examination, after which it was confirmed [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=38.8s)]
*  that they were indeed three Israeli hostages. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=44.86s)]
*  First I want to get your thoughts as we take in these details. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=49.2s)]
*  Well thank you, Sandra. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  I mean this is just the nightmare scenario that we've all been dreading since October [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=54.559999999999995s)]
*  7th when, you know, when the hostages were taken because obviously Hamas has not treated [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=59.31999999999999s)]
*  them in any kind of reasonable way. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=64.39999999999999s)]
*  They are just have been have been pawns of the terror group, you know, for the last two [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=67.28s)]
*  months and this has always been possible. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=73.84s)]
*  I know the Israelis are doing everything they can to mitigate this danger but unfortunately [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=76.36s)]
*  today it came to pass. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=82.0s)]
*  You know, Victoria, this happened in Shadjaya, which is in the northern part of Gaza, which [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=84.24s)]
*  was the scene the other day of that Hamas ambush in which nine or ten IDF soldiers were [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=89.6s)]
*  killed. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=96.56s)]
*  So it's clear that that whole area is on a hair trigger and when you get into a situation [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=97.64s)]
*  like that, when you're engaged in close quarters, ground, almost hand-to-hand combat fighting, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=102.74s)]
*  you see a threat. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=109.67999999999999s)]
*  You're going to try to neutralize it before you check it out. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=110.67999999999999s)]
*  It's an unfortunate product of being in an environment like that but to your knowledge, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=113.34s)]
*  what could the IDF possibly do to mitigate this in the future? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=118.60000000000001s)]
*  Well unfortunately, John, there's no silver bullet here. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=123.66s)]
*  You know, and that's why civilized nations don't behave the way Hamas is behaving in [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=126.86s)]
*  terms of embedding themselves in their own civilian populations, treating Israeli civilians [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=131.66s)]
*  as combatants is what they've essentially done here. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=139.08s)]
*  This is not in any way normal behavior and I think that's what a lot of Americans need [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=142.38000000000002s)]
*  to realize is the leadership of Hamas, while hugely problematic and needs to be eradicated, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=148.3s)]
*  is not the end of this problem. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=155.14000000000001s)]
*  They are so deeply embedded in Gaza and now we're seeing their poll numbers soar in West [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=157.02s)]
*  Bank. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=162.5s)]
*  So this is a very, very deep entrenched problem that Israel is dealing with and they need [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=163.5s)]
*  really strong support from the United States because heaven knows they're not getting it [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=169.9s)]
*  from anywhere else. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=174.02s)]
*  Victoria, also I just want to give further details here on what we're learning. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=175.02s)]
*  Tom Haim was one of the hostages killed in this incident. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=180.1s)]
*  He was kidnapped from Kibbutz, Kaffaraza by the Hamas terrorist organization on October [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=184.94s)]
*  7th. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=189.70000000000002s)]
*  For many who have been following the stories of each of these hostages, he was the drummer [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=190.98000000000002s)]
*  from Kaffaraza. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=195.70000000000002s)]
*  He was last seen in a video. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=197.18s)]
*  He sent his mother on that Saturday morning, October 7th. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=198.46s)]
*  Samar Talalqa, who was also kidnapped from Kibbutz, actually near Am, by the Hamas terrorist [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=202.34s)]
*  organization also on October 7th. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=209.46s)]
*  The third hostages family has been notified but requested that his name not be broadcasted. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=212.1s)]
*  The IDF and the Israel police representatives have notified all of the families at this [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=219.62s)]
*  time. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=224.82s)]
*  Victoria Coats, thank you for joining us on the breaking news here. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFNWHIrW3x4&t=225.88s)]
