# Chris Christie recounts seeing 140 bullet holes in one Israeli home attacked by Hamas
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c)
*  Mr. President, is a hostage deal near? Sir, is a hostage deal near? Mr. President, is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=0.0s)]
*  a hostage deal near? I believe so. I'm not prepared to talk to you. You believe so? Yes. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  That drives me crazy when he makes news on the tarmac, when you can't hear him. But that [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=15.32s)]
*  was news. Because there's fingers crossed right now that that's the word from the president [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=19.52s)]
*  yesterday. As hopes are rising, we could soon get a deal to free some of the hostages that [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=23.28s)]
*  are still being held by Hamas in Gaza. Joining us now, Republican presidential candidate and [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=27.4s)]
*  former New York Jersey governor Chris Christie. It's good to have you here. You were just in [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=33.08s)]
*  Israel. What do you think of the possibility that this hostage deal swap is imminent? Is it [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=37.28s)]
*  possible? Is it going to work? Well, look, I really hope so, Dana and Bill. When I was in [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=44.08s)]
*  Israel last weekend, I met with a number of the families whose family members have been held [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=51.900000000000006s)]
*  hostage now for over seven weeks. And, you know, they gave me this dog tag to keep with me. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=57.78s)]
*  It says, bring them home now. And I think that's exactly the imperative, not only for the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=65.74000000000001s)]
*  Israeli hostages, but for the American hostages that are held there as well. There needs to be a [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=71.9s)]
*  deal made. I hope the Biden administration is working hard towards getting it done because [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=78.54s)]
*  those folks need to stop the suffering of those innocent people who were taken hostage by the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=84.26s)]
*  terrorist organization Hamas. Dana has said this before, and we were just talking during the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=90.94000000000001s)]
*  break. The leaders of Hamas are living in Qatar, and they've made a lot of money. Was there any [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=95.30000000000001s)]
*  conversation about taking them out? Look, you know, I did not get into specific, with the IDF [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=102.9s)]
*  forces that I met with, specific war plans in terms of what they intend to do. And so I don't [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=112.26s)]
*  have any information on that, Bill, but what I did learn when I was there was the level of [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=118.86000000000001s)]
*  inhumanity that those Hamas leaders and their soldiers visited on the people of Israel. I [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=123.9s)]
*  went into a kibbutz, like I said, 600 yards from the Gaza Strip, and I went into a home of a 24-year-old [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=130.86s)]
*  couple who had just recently been married. You saw some of the video right there. The young woman [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=140.78s)]
*  was killed on her couch, still bloodstained. You could smell death in that place. Her husband was [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=145.82s)]
*  killed in the doorway of their bedroom, and I counted it. There were 140 bullet holes in this [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=151.34s)]
*  small four-room home to kill two people. The joy they showed in visiting this inhumanity on these [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=157.1s)]
*  innocent civilians was breathtaking. And what it tells me is that there is no alternative but for [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=164.7s)]
*  Israel to degrade Hamas's military capability to the point where they can't visit this type of [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=170.29999999999998s)]
*  threat on them again. You see me walking around there with the speaker of the Knesset, and he [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=176.22s)]
*  said to me, how do I tell these families to come back and rebuild their homes if Hamas still has a [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=181.5s)]
*  military capability? That's exactly the right question to be asking. And for those people who [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=186.54s)]
*  want to ceasefire, listen, there was a ceasefire on October 6th. It was Hamas that broke in on October 7th. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=191.01999999999998s)]
*  Bernie Sanders is saying that aid will come, but there has to be some changes. This is a quote from him. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=198.62s)]
*  The Netanyahu government, or hopefully a new Israeli government, must understand that not one [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=205.57999999999998s)]
*  penny will be coming to Israel from the U.S. unless there is a fundamental change in their [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=210.45999999999998s)]
*  military and political positions. What do you make about the political divide [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=215.26s)]
*  here in this country when it comes to aiding Israel? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=219.57999999999998s)]
*  I don't understand the data. The fact is Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=224.7s)]
*  Israel is one of our greatest, if not our greatest, ally in the world. And for someone like Senator [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=229.57999999999998s)]
*  Sanders, who they have a hard time running Congress, maybe they should not be spending [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=236.22s)]
*  their time trying to run another government's business. Maybe he should get a budget done [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=241.34s)]
*  in the United States Senate. Maybe he should get the work done there that needs to get done to [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=245.9s)]
*  secure our border. He should get that work done before he's dictating to another government what [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=250.46s)]
*  to do. The fact is this is wartime and it's difficult. And I have confidence in the Israeli [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=256.06s)]
*  defense forces to be able to do the job the right way. I'm convinced from what I saw that they're [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=261.42s)]
*  doing everything they can to try to minimize the deaths of Palestinian civilians. But here's the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=267.02s)]
*  problem. Hamas is forcing those civilians to stay in areas that are militarized because they want [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=273.9s)]
*  to use them as human shields and propaganda weapons against Israel around the world. The fact is [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=280.29999999999995s)]
*  that Israel is doing more to try to protect innocent Palestinian civilians than Hamas is. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=286.21999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Well, the protests here in America, they're just growing larger, to be frank with you. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=291.09999999999997s)]
*  And I don't think, Governor, you know, this war's been on for what, six weeks? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=296.54s)]
*  60 days ago or even 45 days ago, no one in this country predicted that you would see [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=301.1s)]
*  the number of people in the streets and these college campuses protesting Israel as a country [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=306.06s)]
*  or Grand Central Station or Penn Station on a Friday night. It just goes on and on. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=313.98s)]
*  And I'm wondering from your perspective as you travel the country, where do you think that comes [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=318.14s)]
*  from? It comes from an underlying and deep-seated anti-Semitism that exists on college campuses and [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=321.82s)]
*  in other places all over this country. It's been there. You know, I live in the most ethically [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=331.9s)]
*  diverse state in America, in New Jersey. And I can tell you, when I was governor, we had a number [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=337.9s)]
*  of incidents of anti-Semitism where I sent the state police out to synagogues, and this is years [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=343.34s)]
*  ago now, around the state to make sure that those folks were protected and able to practice [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=349.02s)]
*  their faith. The fact is that that anti-Semitism exists and it's flourishing on our college campuses [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=354.29999999999995s)]
*  because of the radical professors that get hired in these college campuses who have an agenda that [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=360.14s)]
*  is anti-Semitic. And that's why I've called for the firing of the president of Harvard, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=365.41999999999996s)]
*  the president of Penn, and the president of Cornell, who have hired these faculty, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=370.29999999999995s)]
*  tenured them, and allowed them to spew their anti-Semitic hate to 18-year-old young people [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=375.5s)]
*  and try to teach them that that's really the way the world should be. It isn't. We need to stand [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=381.42s)]
*  up against the higher education bureaucracy in this country that is allowing this to happen [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=386.14s)]
*  and festering this on college campuses. It's wrong. And those of us in this country who have [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=391.42s)]
*  leadership positions need to be saying it. And this is one of the areas where I think President [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=397.18s)]
*  Biden has not been strong enough. There is not an equivalence right now in this country [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=400.62s)]
*  with anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. There simply isn't. And you can see it from the things that [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=406.78000000000003s)]
*  are happening on college campuses. And so let's stop making fake moral equivalences and let's talk [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=412.14s)]
*  about what the truth is on the ground. And that is that anti-Semitism is being given an opportunity [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=417.26s)]
*  to be flourishing in this country right now and leaders need to stop it. Governor Chris Christie, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=422.46s)]
*  thank you. And I know you're up in New Hampshire today campaigning. We didn't talk a lot about [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=428.94s)]
*  politics, but we talked about an important issue, Israel and its survival. Thank you. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=432.38s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3habKo8Kg6c&t=436.78s)]
