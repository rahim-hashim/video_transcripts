# Plumes of smoke rising over Gaza as Israel continues airstrikes
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtF_PKTBUaA)
*  Plooms of smoke rising over Gaza this morning, two months since the deadly Hamas terror attack on Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtF_PKTBUaA&t=0.0s)]
*  Trey Yanks is live in southern Israel for us this morning. Hi Trey. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtF_PKTBUaA&t=7.4s)]
*  Yeah, hey Todd Carley, good morning. It's been two months since the October 7th massacre and the war still rages on. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtF_PKTBUaA&t=10.4s)]
*  We've been watching here along the border as the Israelis continue air strikes against the northern part of the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtF_PKTBUaA&t=19.2s)]
*  We also know Israeli troops are pushing in deeper on the ground targeting a number of different areas along Gaza, including the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtF_PKTBUaA&t=25.599999999999998s)]
*  Jabalia neighborhood in the north and also Chanyunas, Gaza's second largest city in the south. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtF_PKTBUaA&t=32.3s)]
*  Much of that street to street fighting is causing heavy casualties also among Israeli forces who say now at least 87 of their [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtF_PKTBUaA&t=38.0s)]
*  soldiers have been killed since the ground operation began. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtF_PKTBUaA&t=46.2s)]
*  We also know they're going after the Hamas leadership inside Gaza and looking for those 138 hostages still being held inside the strip. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtF_PKTBUaA&t=49.5s)]
*  We're also learning more about the experience of the hostages. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtF_PKTBUaA&t=58.4s)]
*  This week Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu along with his cabinet meeting with some of the hostages that were released as part of that [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtF_PKTBUaA&t=61.5s)]

*  You are placing politics over the return of the abductees and you are only thinking of rule. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtF_PKTBUaA&t=79.6s)]
*  Now we did speak with that woman's brother just yesterday and he had this to say about their experience. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtF_PKTBUaA&t=84.9s)]
*  There are people that are dying piece by piece there as we speak. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtF_PKTBUaA&t=91.7s)]
*  And we know that both of my sister told us that when they were there they said we were sure that Israel gave up on us. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtF_PKTBUaA&t=102.9s)]
*  There is a lot of frustration among the family members of those who still have loved ones inside Gaza. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtF_PKTBUaA&t=123.60000000000001s)]
