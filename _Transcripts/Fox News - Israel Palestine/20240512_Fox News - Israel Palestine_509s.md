# It will take 'decades' to undo the damage Biden has done: McCarthy
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [May 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU)
*  Whether you're a Republican, conservative, independent, or even a registered Democrat, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm asking for your help in saving America. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=6.42s)]
*  Our country's in trouble. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=9.14s)]
*  It's in big trouble. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=11.08s)]
*  We've never been in trouble. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=12.08s)]
*  We'll end up in World War III. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=13.08s)]
*  These guys are grossly incompetent. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=14.6s)]
*  They have no idea what they're doing. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=16.72s)]
*  They have no idea what they're doing. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=18.76s)]
*  You know in your heart that this country is not going to survive. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=22.12s)]
*  And that was former President Trump at a massive rally last night in Wildwood, New Jersey [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=27.88s)]
*  as the 45th president juggles his campaign schedule around court. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=32.32s)]
*  He faces criminal charges brought by President Biden's Department of Justice, as well as [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  Democrat prosecutors in New York and Georgia. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=40.58s)]
*  Despite being hampered from fully campaigning because he's in court, a new poll from Morning [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=43.44s)]
*  Consult shows 37% of independent voters back President Trump for a second term, compared [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  to 32% for Biden. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=52.84s)]
*  Joining me now with reaction is the former Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=54.8s)]
*  Speaker McCarthy, great to see you again. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=58.68s)]
*  Thanks so much for being here this morning. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=60.08s)]
*  Well, thank you for the invitation to join you. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=61.84s)]
*  Well, your reaction to that rally last night in New Jersey and this idea that foreign policy [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=65.56s)]
*  is being criticized of President Biden just as much as his economic policy. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=72.8s)]
*  That was extraordinary. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=80.52s)]
*  You have to understand New Jersey, not a place that people think Republicans would ever compete, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=81.64s)]
*  but the size of the crowd. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=87.28s)]
*  Could President Biden get that crowd in the heart of New York or in the most Democrat [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  state? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=95.96s)]
*  Could he do it in California? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=96.96s)]
*  The answer is no. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=98.0s)]
*  And the other thing that we're hearing coming out of the White House itself is the White [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=99.52s)]
*  House is now saying President Biden needs to campaign less, talk less because he gets [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  in trouble while doing it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=108.12s)]
*  This is President Trump showing no matter what they throw at him, he's going to fight [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=109.92s)]
*  back. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=114.72s)]
*  He's going to lead this nation on the issues they care most about. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=115.72s)]
*  And a very compelling issue. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=118.36s)]
*  You had an interesting statistic up there about independent voters. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=120.28s)]
*  There was another poll out there that showed independent voters by 53% to 42 believed a [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=123.69999999999999s)]
*  second term of the Biden administration would be a greater harm to democracy because all [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=129.6s)]
*  of this is backfiring, this persecution of President Trump, using, going after him because [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=134.84s)]
*  of politics. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=139.8s)]
*  No one in America believes President Trump would be in a trial today if he was not running [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=141.10000000000002s)]
*  for president. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  They're coming after our democracy. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=148.04000000000002s)]
*  And it just shows last night with that crowd. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=149.88000000000002s)]
*  You got Lawrence Taylor. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=152.60000000000002s)]
*  You have Democrats in that crowd, independents. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=153.60000000000002s)]
*  I would be very concerned if I was in the White House today. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=156.16000000000003s)]
*  Immigrants are also very upset by President Biden's decision to hold back shipments to [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=160.36s)]
*  Israel. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=164.96s)]
*  You were just in Israel, I know, and he's basically saying, do it this way, or we're [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=165.96s)]
*  not even going to share information with you, intelligence that it has about where the Hamas [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=171.32000000000002s)]
*  terrorists are if they go into Ra'a. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=175.96s)]
*  We will study this decision for a century. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=181.48000000000002s)]
*  This is one of the greatest harms to American philosophy going around the world. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  When Israel was created 75 years ago, the first country to recognize him within 11 minutes [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=190.48s)]
*  was America. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=195.83999999999997s)]
*  We have always said it's one of our greatest allies. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=197.04s)]
*  Even President Biden within the last year said he will always stand with Israel. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=199.82s)]
*  Then what has transpired? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=204.27999999999997s)]
*  Israel was attacked on October 7th. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=205.92s)]
*  There are hostages being held to this day. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=208.2s)]
*  There are American hostages being held. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=210.83999999999997s)]
*  And now President Biden, just weeks after Republicans and Democrats bound together by [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=213.6s)]
*  overwhelming numbers to fund Israel to withhold it for a terrorist organization, he's picking [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=219.12s)]
*  a terrorist organization. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=226.52s)]
*  He's picking politics of college campuses. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=228.04s)]
*  And you have to think how this will set us back with our allies and our enemies. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=230.76s)]
*  Since President Biden came into office, we have now something that hasn't happened in [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=235.12s)]
*  80 years. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=239.34s)]
*  You have an axis of evil. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=240.4s)]
*  Iran, Russia and China bounding together like the 1930s. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=242.56s)]
*  You have five American embassies that have to be evacuated. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=247.08s)]
*  You have Russians now entering American base in Africa and asking Americans to leave. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=250.72s)]
*  You now watch that China has entered the Middle East, brokering relationships with Saudi Arabia [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=257.04s)]
*  and Iran, a job that America used to do. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=263.04s)]
*  This is all based. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=266.14s)]
*  And then Afghanistan. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=267.14s)]
*  The decision on Afghanistan, those 13 American gold star families leaving Americans behind, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=268.72s)]
*  and now Israel. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=275.03999999999996s)]
*  This is some of the greatest damage to American foreign policy we have seen in decades and [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=276.46s)]
*  will take decades to solve it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=281.85999999999996s)]
*  And he's doing this based upon a political decision that is fundamentally wrong, playing [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=284.34s)]
*  into the hands of a terrorist organization while keeping our border wide open and America [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=289.94s)]
*  vulnerable more than we've been in centuries. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=295.65999999999997s)]
*  Well, that's the most extraordinary part of it. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=299.14s)]
*  And Speaker, I want to get your take on what you just heard from Marjorie Taylor Greene. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=301.26s)]
*  I've got to get your reaction about another effort to take down the current speaker, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=304.66s)]
*  Mike Johnson. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=309.98s)]
*  What goes on in these meetings where you go in there and you can't get any leeway whatsoever [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=311.34000000000003s)]
*  in terms of securing the border and you keep going with the way things are going and the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=318.14000000000004s)]
*  way things have been doing? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=322.66s)]
*  Again, we're seeing this with Mike Johnson. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=324.02000000000004s)]
*  Well, I disagree with our ability of not being able to secure the border. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=326.90000000000003s)]
*  Yesterday was the one year anniversary that we were able to pass H.R.2, the strongest [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=333.14s)]
*  border security bill that Congress has ever watched. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=338.58s)]
*  Well, we passed that. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=341.41999999999996s)]
*  What you have to do is not give up on it. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=342.5s)]
*  Watch everything we are able to accomplish in the first nine months, not just border [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=345.5s)]
*  security, but could cut $2 trillion, reform welfare, Parents' Bill of Rights, energy independence, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=349.06s)]
*  knocking down Washington, D.C. when they wanted to decriminalize so many different bills, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=356.85999999999996s)]
*  standing up for individuals. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=363.1s)]
*  We were able to stop the pandemic when the president said he would not sign it. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=364.66s)]
*  When you stick together, there's nothing you cannot achieve. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=368.66s)]
*  Don't play into the hands of Democrats. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=371.94s)]
*  Look, I opposed when eight Republicans joined all the Democrats to do a motion to vacate, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=374.1s)]
*  and I oppose it when more Republicans today do it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=379.86s)]
*  It is wrong, less bound together. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=382.78s)]
*  Stick on the issues of what America cares most about, the border, inflation, American [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=385.94s)]
*  foreign policy, making our parents have a say in their kids' education, bringing down [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=391.46000000000004s)]
*  the price of fuel, making sure that government is not dictating, and this weaponization of [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=396.66s)]
*  government. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=402.06s)]
*  Remember, I created a select committee on the weaponization of government. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=403.06s)]
*  We created a select committee on China. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=406.42s)]
*  We have the tools to govern. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=408.56s)]
*  The Republicans just have to bound together and not let Hakeem Jeffries say that he is [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=410.66s)]
*  the speaker and the majority of the House. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=415.52000000000004s)]
*  He said it specifically, Speaker, do you support Mike Johnson? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=418.88s)]
*  I support Mike Johnson. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=424.32s)]
*  And look, it is a tough job. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=425.59999999999997s)]
*  But the thing Republicans need to do focus on what we've done. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=427.91999999999996s)]
*  Do not give up on H.R. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=432.0s)]
*  too. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=433.44s)]
*  You can do Ukraine and the border at the exact same time. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFfPQFiAU&t=434.44s)]
