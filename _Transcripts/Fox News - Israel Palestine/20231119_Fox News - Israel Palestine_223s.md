# ‘OUTRIGHT FALSE’: NYC mom sounds alarm on schools' 'antisemitic abuse'
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo)
*  when hundreds of students walked out of school cursing at Israel while hurling anti-Semitic [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=0.0s)]
*  smears. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=6.24s)]
*  Doesn't sound very helpful for like the school environment. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=7.24s)]
*  Our next guest was one of those parents tossed from the meeting. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=10.68s)]
*  Lisa Liss pulled her kids from this district last year over concerns of anti-Semitism. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=13.56s)]
*  She joins us now. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=19.28s)]
*  Lisa, thank you for being here. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=20.28s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=21.28s)]
*  You've got young kids that were in the school. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=22.28s)]
*  You were very involved in the school. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=23.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=25.0s)]
*  So you had pulled them even before what happened on October 7th. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=26.0s)]
*  So we can talk about what's happened now, but what were you seeing a year ago that maybe [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=28.6s)]
*  didn't surprise you what's happening now? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=32.92s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=34.6s)]
*  I was on the PTA for about two years from 2020 to 2022. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=35.6s)]
*  And I started seeing things then with the escalation back in May of 2021. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  I started seeing educators for Palestine hosting teach-ins and I was just keeping a very close [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=44.2s)]
*  eye on things. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=50.260000000000005s)]
*  And I was seeing the language of our CEC very much mimic what was being taught that was [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  incredibly concerning and just outright false. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=57.48s)]
*  And is this around in elementary school too? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=60.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=64.48s)]
*  This was in elementary school. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=65.48s)]
*  This is in an elementary school. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=66.75999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=67.75999999999999s)]
*  And it didn't make its way directly into my school at the time. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=68.75999999999999s)]
*  But this is concerning elementary all the way up through 12. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  But definitely it is starting in elementary. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=75.44s)]
*  And so if you had a Jewish kid in the school or someone who supports Israel in the school, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=77.5s)]
*  at this point, it's probably an impossible situation just to get an education. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=84.16s)]
*  It's I think scary for families. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=88.24s)]
*  I think it depends on the school and how the schools are handling it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=90.36s)]
*  But knowing that this is existing, knowing what happened with the walkout the other week, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=92.84s)]
*  it is terrifying for families. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=98.36s)]
*  Is this writ large in New York City? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=100.96s)]
*  Is this because of one particular part of Brooklyn or is this kind of a New York City [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=103.56s)]
*  school system thing? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  So I'm really only familiar with our district and our CEC. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  And I was under the impression that this is how it operated throughout the district. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=112.92s)]
*  And in speaking with more CECs, getting to know more families, it does seem fairly isolated [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=116.4s)]
*  that this intensity is in our district. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=122.24000000000001s)]
*  I can't speak to the other districts, but they all seem to operate a bit differently. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=126.64s)]
*  But our districts specifically seem to filter this throughout the city. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=131.44s)]
*  Why is the pro-Palestinian cause, which now has to be OK with an association with Hamas [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=136.36s)]
*  at this point, why is it so strong inside schools? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=143.84s)]
*  I think there's just a very big overall un-Americanism going on. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=148.92000000000002s)]
*  And I do think that that is definitely tied to being pro-Israel. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=153.64000000000001s)]
*  The values of Israel and America very much align. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=158.52s)]
*  And once we start seeing those values disintegrate, and that's coming in through DEI, through [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=162.06s)]
*  anti-racism, through SEL, it's being taught through just a very hyper-race-focused lens, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=167.22s)]
*  being taught through the oppressor versus oppressed, it's being taught through being [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=173.82s)]
*  on stolen land and land back. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=177.9s)]
*  And those narratives and those conversations make their way into the anti-Israel. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=180.58s)]
*  SEL being social-emotional learning. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=186.94s)]
*  So all of those things open the portal for something like this to be even more dramatic. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=191.01999999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=196.26s)]
*  And you say it's steeped in anti-Americanism. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=197.26s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=199.33999999999997s)]
*  Very interesting. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=200.33999999999997s)]
*  And what are you doing with your kids now? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=201.33999999999997s)]
*  They are in a private Jewish school in the city. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=202.45999999999998s)]
*  Good for you. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=205.42s)]
*  That's what parents have to do. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=206.42s)]
*  That is absolutely. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=207.42s)]
*  It wasn't in our plans, but we're happy. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=208.42s)]
*  Thank you for having your eye on what the school is doing, doing something about it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=212.06s)]
*  And if they're going to kick you out of virtual meetings, what are you going to do? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=217.06s)]
*  Lisa List, thank you so much. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=220.57999999999998s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=221.82s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_vfRM5ydo&t=222.82s)]
