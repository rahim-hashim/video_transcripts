# Tom Cotton warns 'sooner or later Americans are going to die'
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g)
*  All right, Jackie, joining us now is Arkansas Republican Senator Tom Cotton. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=0.0s)]
*  We're going to be hearing from John Kirby in just a few minutes, Senator. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=3.4s)]
*  But I wanted to start us off with something he said yesterday [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=6.28s)]
*  or maybe the day before about the fact that these attacks [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=9.6s)]
*  that are being launched by the Houthis need to stop. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=12.72s)]
*  Listen here. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=15.08s)]
*  But bottom line is these attacks have to stop. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=16.4s)]
*  They need to stop. They're unacceptable. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=19.0s)]
*  The United States, our allies and our partners will do what we have to do [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=21.04s)]
*  to counter these threats and to protect these ships. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  We're going to do what we have to do to counter these threats. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=26.88s)]
*  The U.S., it seems to me, with all its firepower and the Houthis [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=29.68s)]
*  limited limited firepower, can stop this in an afternoon. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=32.8s)]
*  But they don't seem to have any inclination to do that. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=36.0s)]
*  Yeah, John, the press secretary at the White House demanding it [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=42.08s)]
*  is not going to make it happen. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=44.64s)]
*  What's going to make it happen is what you just said. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  American firepower, air and naval strikes against the Houthis, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=47.4s)]
*  against their firing batteries, against their ammunition storage sites [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=50.72s)]
*  and other command and control facilities. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=53.96s)]
*  That should have happened two months ago. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=55.92s)]
*  The very first strikes the Houthis launched towards Israel [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=57.36s)]
*  or towards our ships or towards commercial vessels. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=60.76s)]
*  They're transiting through the Red Sea, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=63.48s)]
*  where one eighth of global commerce goes, even more of global oil trade. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=64.92s)]
*  The fact that it hasn't happened yet is why these attacks are accelerating. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=68.64s)]
*  It's the same kind of story you see against the strikes on our troops [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=72.48s)]
*  in Iraq and Syria. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=75.2s)]
*  The more we let Iran's proxies get away with these attacks, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=76.92s)]
*  the more we're going to get of them. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=80.16s)]
*  And sooner or later, Americans are going to die [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=82.03999999999999s)]
*  and it's going to hurt the American economy, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=84.84s)]
*  because, again, the Red Sea is so vital for global trade. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=87.44000000000001s)]
*  It's long overdue that we should be conducting air and naval strikes [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=90.68s)]
*  against the Houthis for the threat they propose. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=94.92s)]
*  They pose to our sailors and to global commerce. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=96.92s)]
*  A moment ago, we saw on the screen something that happened on November [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=100.28s)]
*  the 19th when Houthi rebels, kind of like Somali pirates, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=103.64000000000001s)]
*  only much more sophisticated because they had a helicopter to do it, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=106.80000000000001s)]
*  landed on the deck of the Galaxy leader and hijacked that joint statement [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=109.80000000000001s)]
*  from the State Department saying the Houthi led seizure of the Galaxy leader [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=114.6s)]
*  November 19th in detention of its 25 member international crew, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=118.2s)]
*  who remain unjustly detained is appalling. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=121.88s)]
*  Such behavior also threatens the movement of food, fuel, humanitarian assistance [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=124.56s)]
*  and other essential commodities to destinations and populations all over the world. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=128.72s)]
*  There is no justification for these attacks. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=132.92s)]
*  That there's in that statement, there's a lot of tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsking, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=136.56s)]
*  but nothing that would constitute an actual response or some kind of deterrent. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=141.12s)]
*  That, John, a sternly worded statement is not going to scare the Houthis [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=147.84s)]
*  or to deter them from these attacks. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  Shooting down their helicopters and they approach ships is going to deter them. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=154.72s)]
*  We had this example of this in the 1980s in the Persian Gulf with Ronald Reagan [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=158.8s)]
*  and Iran itself, which was threatening US naval ships and commercial shipping. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=163.28s)]
*  Ronald Reagan finally sank half of their Navy and blew up lots of their oil platforms. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=167.48000000000002s)]
*  And what happened? Iran pulled in its horns. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=172.28s)]
*  It stopped the attacks on shipping and even ended its eight year war [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=174.56s)]
*  with Iran and Iraq, between Iran and Iraq. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=177.52s)]
*  In the middle of those strikes, someone asked Ronald Reagan [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=181.08s)]
*  if we were now at war with Iran. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=183.56s)]
*  He just laughed and said, no, Iran wouldn't be that stupid. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=185.16000000000003s)]
*  And that's exactly what would happen if we took down all of the Houthis [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=188.28s)]
*  capabilities to launch these attacks against ships and naval vessels in the Red Sea. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=192.12s)]
*  Then they would not be so stupid as to try to retaliate. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=197.44s)]
*  And frankly, they wouldn't be able to retaliate anymore. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=200.84s)]
*  So then, Senator, do you have any idea why Biden is showing so much restraint? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=203.84s)]
*  I mean, there might be something with Saudi Arabia worried that the truce [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=208.88s)]
*  that it has with the Houthis is fragile, doesn't want that to flare up again. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=212.4s)]
*  But as Ronald Reagan said, they wouldn't be stupid enough to go to war with us. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=216.56s)]
*  So what's holding Biden back? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=220.08s)]
*  Well, I think it's this failed. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=221.64s)]
*  Iran policy is failed Middle East policy. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=226.48s)]
*  Remember, Donald Trump put the Houthis on the foreign terrorist list. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=228.6s)]
*  Joe Biden, in one of his first actions in office, removed them from that list. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=232.79999999999998s)]
*  It would be an indictment of that decision, just like it's an indictment of the Iran policy. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=236.32s)]
*  I mean, where did Houthis, a bunch of goat herders in the mountains of Yemen, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=241.04s)]
*  get land attack cruise missiles? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=244.32s)]
*  They got them or their components from Iran. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=246.48s)]
*  This is an indictment of his Iran policy. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=249.32s)]
*  And again, it's just what you see with the strikes in our troops in Iraq and Syria [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=251.16s)]
*  or frankly, what you've seen in Ukraine for two years. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=254.96s)]
*  Biden is scared of what he calls escalation of strikes that are going to lead [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=257.56s)]
*  to bigger strikes by our enemies. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=261.84s)]
*  But we already have escalation. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=263.4s)]
*  We already have a wider war in the Middle East. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=265.28s)]
*  The way to restore peace and stability is for firm, decisive action [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=267.44s)]
*  by destroying the Houthis capability to launch these attacks. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=273.24s)]
*  Well, we'll see if this comes up in the White House briefing just minutes ahead. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=276.6s)]
*  Tom Cotton, senator from the great state of Arkansas, we don't see you. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  Merry Christmas. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=282.96s)]
*  Thank you, John. Merry Christmas to you and all your viewers. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=285.48s)]
*  All right. See you again soon. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU--FiXOd3g&t=287.76s)]
