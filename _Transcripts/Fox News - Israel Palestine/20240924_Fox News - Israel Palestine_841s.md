# Hezbollah commander killed in Beirut strike: IDF
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [September 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs)
*  We begin with breaking news and we are working to confirm all of the details on this, but [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel right now, through its military, says it has just killed a Hezbollah commander in [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=5.0s)]
*  a strike on the country's capital, Beirut, Lebanon. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=10.92s)]
*  This would be a development of epic proportions that they could hit that commander inside [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=16.580000000000002s)]
*  that city. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=22.56s)]
*  So we are following that. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=24.18s)]
*  We're reporting to come just shortly and I want to mention the timing of this. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=25.959999999999997s)]
*  President Biden just wrapping up his comments, the last that he will make as the commander [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=30.939999999999998s)]
*  in chief of the United States at the United Nations General Assembly. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=35.48s)]
*  And he spoke some words about how a two-state solution and two sides and all these things [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=40.2s)]
*  were going to kind of come together and that America was committed. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=46.64s)]
*  But he did not give a map of leadership through this moment. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=51.04s)]
*  We'll get into it. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=55.92s)]
*  I'm Harris Faulkner. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  You are in the Faulkner Focus. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=59.72s)]
*  Exactly what Biden said about the conflict moments ago. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=62.28s)]
*  Let's watch. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  Since October 7, we've also been determined to prevent a wider war that engulfs the entire [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  region. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=74.0s)]
*  Hezboah, unprovoked, during the October 7 attack, launching rockets into Israel. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=75.0s)]
*  Almost a year later, too many on each side of the Israeli-Lebanon border remain displaced. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=83.52s)]
*  Full-scale war is not in anyone's interest. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=89.96000000000001s)]
*  Even if the situation has escalated, a diplomatic solution is still possible. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=93.0s)]
*  The Pentagon has announced the United States is sending what it calls now. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=98.56s)]
*  Now, when this news broke this time yesterday, they didn't give any details of how many of [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=102.4s)]
*  our military men and women would be now going to the Middle East. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=106.72s)]
*  Now he's saying, Major General Ryder, that it'll be a small number. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=112.08000000000001s)]
*  Well, we have 40,000 of them there, so I guess smaller than 40,000. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=116.52000000000001s)]
*  Details on this would be important, too. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=121.08000000000001s)]
*  How much more does this commit us as a possibility of wider war is breaking out in that region [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=123.26s)]
*  with Israel at the center fighting in both directions north and then toward Hamas and [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=129.18s)]
*  the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=135.94s)]
*  Our staunchest ally in that region. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=138.44s)]
*  And here's what that fight looks like on that northern border with Lebanon. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=146.62s)]
*  Israel saying it has finished a second wave now of strikes on Hezbollah targets today. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=150.70000000000002s)]
*  They are seven hours ahead of us. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=156.14000000000001s)]
*  So when we show you fresh live video, you'll know that it's coming upon darkness there. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=158.34s)]
*  The Israeli Defense Force also confirms a targeted strike in Lebanon's capital of Beirut. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=167.0s)]
*  And that is where I started this hour. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=171.58s)]
*  Lebanon says that at least 558 people were killed in Israeli air strikes yesterday. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=174.76s)]
*  The deadliest day for that country in nearly two decades. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=180.7s)]
*  Now remember when they started hitting Israel with a ramp up. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=184.58s)]
*  It was a few hours after the massacre by Hamas terrorists on October 7th. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=188.22s)]
*  So by the morning of October 8th, Hezbollah had begun to hit Israel and they have not [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=193.02s)]
*  stopped. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=198.02s)]
*  Tens of thousands of people on both sides of that border between Israel and Lebanon [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=199.02s)]
*  have had to be evacuated out of that zone. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=203.84s)]
*  Southern Lebanon, a war zone. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=208.3s)]
*  Israel is hitting targets, terror targets inside that country. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=211.78s)]
*  Iran's president is also at the United Nations General Assembly where he said he will keep [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=216.38s)]
*  backing the Hezbollah terrorists. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=222.14s)]
*  Republicans say it is time to get tougher on Iran. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=225.42s)]
*  They funded Hamas Hezbollah and put it into their war machine. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=229.78s)]
*  We're reaping what Biden has sown. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=233.34s)]
*  The people of Israel are reaping the bad policy choices of Biden and Harris. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=235.57999999999998s)]
*  Every time you hear de-escalate from this administration, Iran escalates because they [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=240.44s)]
*  smell weakness and they seek advantage. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=244.98000000000002s)]
*  We have a stake in ensuring Israel emerges from this conflict stronger and these terrorist [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=247.42000000000002s)]
*  organizations and the Iranian patron weaker. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=254.06s)]
*  Our correspondent Nate Foy is in Tel Aviv, Israel with more. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=258.66s)]
*  Nate? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=262.62s)]
*  Harris, breaking just within the past few minutes, Israel is confirming that an airstrike [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=263.62s)]
*  in Beirut has killed another Hezbollah commander. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=269.72s)]
*  This time a leading figure in the group's rocket division. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=273.54s)]
*  His name is Ibrahim Khabisi. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=276.78000000000003s)]
*  Take a look at this video from Beirut as Israel's pressure campaign on Hezbollah continues taking [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=279.3s)]
*  out its leaders. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=285.34000000000003s)]
*  Remember, an Israeli strike killed several Hezbollah commanders, including the group's [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=286.34000000000003s)]
*  elite Rodwan unit commander Ibrahim Akil in Beirut last week. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=290.86s)]
*  Israel is again warning residents to get out of harm's way today. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=295.74s)]
*  According to Lebanon's health ministry, 558 people were killed yesterday, more than 1800 [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=299.46000000000004s)]
*  others injured, and that number is growing today. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=305.74s)]
*  Meanwhile, falling shrapnel injured an Israeli soldier in the north. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=309.66s)]
*  Hezbollah is not slowing down after firing 250 rockets yesterday. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=314.06s)]
*  Here's northern Israel this morning. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=319.46000000000004s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=321.1s)]
*  And Harris, the people who live here in northern Israel have been fired on nearly every day [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=330.38s)]
*  by Hezbollah since October 8th of last year. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=335.98s)]
*  It's tough. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=341.82s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of stress, mostly because of all the rockets coming up, but there's [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=342.82s)]
*  a feeling of finally we're taking action. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=350.1s)]
*  Take a look at this direct hit in the north, Harris. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=356.65999999999997s)]
*  Unbelievably, nobody was injured here, but you see a Hezbollah rocket smashed into the [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=360.62s)]
*  side of the road as people pulled over there. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=365.62s)]
*  Meanwhile, intense fire continues today. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=368.5s)]
*  So far, just today, Hezbollah has fired an additional 155 rockets, and Israeli Prime [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=370.94s)]
*  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promises that the Israeli fire on Hezbollah will continue. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=377.14s)]
*  We'll send it back to you. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=382.58s)]
*  Great reporting as always, Nate. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=384.66s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=386.18s)]
*  Senator Dan Sullivan, Republican of Alaska, member of the Armed Services and Veterans [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=387.18s)]
*  Affairs Committees, and he is also the Republican representative for the United States at the [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=391.70000000000005s)]
*  United Nations. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=397.74s)]
*  A big week for you, and so glad to have you on set with me. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=398.74s)]
*  Great to be on the show, Harris. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=401.98s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=402.98s)]
*  Look, absolutely. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=403.98s)]
*  We don't know what Kamala Harris' foreign policy is going to be. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=404.98s)]
*  We just saw the last speech by the sitting president, and it was not strong considering [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=408.34000000000003s)]
*  the breaking news right now. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=413.9s)]
*  I mean, there is a war now across that line and between Lebanon and Israel. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=415.38s)]
*  If this is what we get under President Biden, what in the world would we get under Vice [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=422.34s)]
*  President Kamala Harris if she wins the White House? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=427.5s)]
*  Well, it's such an important question, and you just saw the speech, right? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=429.78s)]
*  Biden mentions climate change six times in Iran twice. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=434.26s)]
*  I mean, if that's not indicative of this administration's priorities, Biden, Harris, I don't know. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=439.86s)]
*  But what we've seen is chaos throughout the world. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=446.94s)]
*  His last foreign policy speech, I think Americans and people around the world need to ask this [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=451.78s)]
*  question. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=456.82s)]
*  Is America and our allies safer today than it was four years ago? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=457.82s)]
*  The answer is absolutely not. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=461.46s)]
*  And one of the biggest areas in which that has been true and a failure of this administration [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=463.26s)]
*  is the appeasement of Iran. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=469.54s)]
*  Iran is the agent of chaos everywhere. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=472.3s)]
*  You're reporting right now, I was just showing that. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=474.86s)]
*  They have appeased Iran in every sphere. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=478.18s)]
*  And as you mentioned, I think with Kamala Harris, it would be way worse. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=480.94s)]
*  And you've got to compare the record of the Trump administration with regard to Iran, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=486.86s)]
*  where we reestablished deterrence, put them in a box, crushed them economically, killed [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=490.34000000000003s)]
*  their terrorist leaders and launched a peace initiative with the Abraham Accords. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=495.18s)]
*  Such a contrast in terms of records. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=499.38s)]
*  Well, and what's really dangerous is that we don't know what she would do. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=501.78000000000003s)]
*  That's right. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=504.78000000000003s)]
*  Because we don't know who's making these decisions now. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=505.78000000000003s)]
*  I mean, Biden has been about as lame duck as you could be. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=507.98s)]
*  They took him off the top of the ticket and now he moves on. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=510.74s)]
*  He even talked about that at the UN saying it was his decision to bring it up there, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=512.82s)]
*  seemed out of context. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=517.82s)]
*  He had to have known. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=519.54s)]
*  And I'm not on the Armed Services Committee for the Senate, but I would think that there [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=521.38s)]
*  was even a heads up for you. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=524.5799999999999s)]
*  Maybe it wasn't confirmed, but you knew they took somebody out. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=526.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=529.62s)]
*  And look, in the fact that the president's up there saying, hey, I left voluntarily, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=530.62s)]
*  that's a little bit rich because the whole world knows what happened. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=535.4599999999999s)]
*  But again, this issue of where this administration has been relative to the Trump administration, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=540.54s)]
*  this is a really interesting election because you have two records. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=547.5s)]
*  One of the Trump administration when they were in power in terms of foreign policy and [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=552.26s)]
*  national security and one of Biden, Harris. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=555.34s)]
*  And these records couldn't be more different. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=558.46s)]
*  And for the American people, much more security for our country and our allies under President [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=560.46s)]
*  Trump. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=566.6600000000001s)]
*  This seemed to have a rapid ramp up in the Middle East. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=567.6600000000001s)]
*  And in fact, I'll get more to this in a second about who we're sending and how many. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=571.1800000000001s)]
*  But a new Wall Street Journal opinion piece says Biden's diplomatic magical thinking, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=575.78s)]
*  no administration in American history has been as committed to Middle East diplomacy [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=581.66s)]
*  as this one. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=586.9399999999999s)]
*  Yet has any other administration's diplomats ever had less success? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=588.3s)]
*  Your reaction? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=594.54s)]
*  Well, one thing that you have to when you look at history, diplomacy has to be backed [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=595.34s)]
*  by strength. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=600.46s)]
*  And that was a great Wall Street Journal piece because they mentioned all the diplomacy, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=601.9s)]
*  but they also mentioned this fact about the Biden, Harris administration. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=605.9s)]
*  They put forward budget cuts to our Department of Defense every single year. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=609.5s)]
*  So the Republicans were all about peace through strength. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=615.98s)]
*  That was in our platform in Milwaukee this past summer. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=618.94s)]
*  The Biden administration, Biden, Harris administration right now, Harris, their budget shrinks the [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=622.62s)]
*  army, shrinks the Navy, shrinks the Marine Corps. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=627.26s)]
*  You can't have effective diplomacy as you are gutting the readiness of your military. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=629.98s)]
*  All right. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=634.7s)]
*  I want to get to two things. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=634.94s)]
*  First of all, Major General Ryder told us yesterday and then it filled in the blanks [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=635.98s)]
*  a little bit saying, well, it's a small number that they're sending to the Middle East to [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=640.7s)]
*  shore up the 40,000 who were there. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=644.46s)]
*  Well, that's anything less than 40,000. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=646.22s)]
*  What is happening in, and you're on armed services, what is happening that you can tell us [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=648.78s)]
*  that's next for the United States in that region? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=654.78s)]
*  And keeping in mind, we have to back Israel. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=657.66s)]
*  We 100% have to back Israel. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=661.34s)]
*  And one of the things that's been so frustrating with this administration is that some of the [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=663.26s)]
*  most effective tools that we have in terms of backing Israel in reestablishing deterrence [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=668.14s)]
*  with regard to Iran aren't necessarily military tools. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=674.06s)]
*  Let me give you the best example. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=677.5s)]
*  The Trump administration undertook maximum sanctions against the Iranian oil and gas [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=679.42s)]
*  industry. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=685.34s)]
*  By the end of the Trump administration, Iran's economy was in freefall. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=686.06s)]
*  They were exporting only about 200,000 barrels a day. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=690.22s)]
*  They had about $4 billion in foreign reserves, which was nothing. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=693.26s)]
*  The Biden-Harris administration comes in, day one, they stop enforcing these sanctions. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=697.74s)]
*  What does that do? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=703.6600000000001s)]
*  Iran is exporting almost 3 million barrels a day, has close to $100 billion in foreign reserves. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=704.7s)]
*  And what are they doing with that? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=712.3000000000001s)]
*  They're funding and equipping and training Hezbollah, the Houthis, Hamas. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=713.5s)]
*  So a lot of this appeasement has been just reversing what the Trump administration did [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=719.18s)]
*  so well, and you're seeing the chaos all over the Middle East. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=724.06s)]
*  The president, Biden and Harris, should at least reimpose these sanctions. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=728.62s)]
*  I have yet to hear her talk about it. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=733.02s)]
*  No, they won't. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=735.0999999999999s)]
*  I mean, they can do what they do, but it's time to talk to the American people. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=735.9799999999999s)]
*  You broke some news with me in the hallway as we were coming to set. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=739.9799999999999s)]
*  I want to just take a moment. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=742.62s)]
*  Russia. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=744.54s)]
*  We cannot take our eyes off Russia. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=745.42s)]
*  You said a fourth incursion. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=747.0999999999999s)]
*  What's happening in Iraq? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=748.3s)]
*  Actually, five. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=748.78s)]
*  Five. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=749.9s)]
*  In the last two weeks, we've had five Russian bear bomber incursions into our aides, our airspace. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=749.98s)]
*  Our great men and women in the military have gone up and intercepted these aircraft. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=758.06s)]
*  By the way, Harris, just about a month and a half ago, we had a joint Russian-Chinese [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=763.74s)]
*  bear bomber incursion into the Alaska airspace. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=769.74s)]
*  Strategic bombers with fighters, we had to go turn them around. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=773.02s)]
*  But again, this is showing the weakness of the Biden-Harris administration. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=776.86s)]
*  This level of aggressiveness from the two biggest adversaries in my part of the world, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=782.86s)]
*  Alaska, the Arctic, the North Pacific, is unprecedented. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=788.94s)]
*  They've never done these kind of joint patrols. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=792.62s)]
*  They're doing it with regard to the Navy, too, in Alaska waters. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=794.78s)]
*  So we have a lot going on in terms of aggressiveness of our adversaries. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=798.86s)]
*  And the best way to address that is to regrow our military. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=803.4200000000001s)]
*  And this administration won't do that. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=807.74s)]
*  Senator Dan Sullivan of the great state of Alaska, and representing all of us as the [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=811.9s)]
*  United States at the UN today, you brought a lot to bear today. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=816.7s)]
*  And I'm appreciative of you being here. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSdxJCzLoRs&t=821.82s)]
