# Hostage deal reached in Israel-Hamas conflict
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlSdexxvQig)
*  Welcome to this special edition of Hannity. I'm Judge Jeanine Pirro in Farshawn tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlSdexxvQig&t=0.0s)]
*  And we begin with breaking news. Moments ago, Israel approved what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was calling a lull in the fighting with Hamas. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlSdexxvQig&t=6.0s)]
*  In exchange, Hamas will reportedly return 50 hostages, women and children, during a four-day pause in fighting. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlSdexxvQig&t=16.0s)]
*  And just in, Reuters is reporting that Hamas has also just agreed to the deal. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlSdexxvQig&t=25.0s)]
*  Here now with the very latest from Tel Aviv, Alex Hogan is with us. Alex? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlSdexxvQig&t=31.0s)]
*  Hi, Judge Jeanine. This is major news. After weeks of trying to strike a deal, Israel tonight says that it has approved this hostage negotiation deal. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlSdexxvQig&t=36.0s)]
*  And what this would do essentially, allowing the release of 50 hostages, women and children, in exchange for a four-day ceasefire, as well as the release of Palestinians currently being detained in Israel. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlSdexxvQig&t=45.0s)]
*  Israel also tonight says that if 10 additional hostages are released every single day, that would allow another pause in the fighting. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlSdexxvQig&t=58.0s)]
*  We have heard concern from Israeli officials on the ground that any ceasefire would allow Hamas to regroup, regain its forces, and then fight back. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlSdexxvQig&t=66.0s)]
*  But Israeli security officials tonight say they support this plan and that the security and intelligence will be maintained on the ground. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlSdexxvQig&t=74.0s)]
*  And families have been protesting day in and day out, calling on the government to strike a deal. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlSdexxvQig&t=82.0s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked President Joe Biden for some of the help in these talks. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlSdexxvQig&t=87.0s)]
*  But while this agreed release of 50 people is a great win for people here in Israel, there's only freeing up one fifth of the people that have been taken. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlSdexxvQig&t=93.0s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the way that this will work is that the hostages will likely be released in several groups. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlSdexxvQig&t=104.0s)]
*  And what we're expecting to see is that they could be released as soon as within 24 hours, only, of course, if everything from here until then goes according to plan. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlSdexxvQig&t=111.0s)]
*  Judge Anin. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlSdexxvQig&t=121.0s)]
*  All right. Now, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calls this a lull and not a ceasefire. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlSdexxvQig&t=122.0s)]
*  Is there any significance to that? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlSdexxvQig&t=127.0s)]
*  I think there is because looking at the strategic effort that we have seen, the military continuing to move forward, not only in the north but in the south, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlSdexxvQig&t=130.0s)]
*  there is the real concern that Hamas could regroup. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlSdexxvQig&t=138.0s)]
*  So there is going to have to be a lot of preparation on the ground to make sure that Israel is able to keep its strategic offenses and its its ground forces where they are without giving up territory and without giving up any of the gains that they have made in the last several weeks being on the ground. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlSdexxvQig&t=141.0s)]
*  But it is worth noting, of course, back here tonight, this is just a major celebration for the families who are hoping that their loved ones could be a part of those 50 who could be released. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlSdexxvQig&t=158.0s)]
*  Well, certainly a happy Thanksgiving in any event if it occurs in the next couple of days. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlSdexxvQig&t=169.0s)]
