# Morgan Ortagus: The myth of the Iranian moderate is dead
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40)
*  Let's bring back Morgan Ortega, former State Department spokesperson, founder of Polaris [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=0.0s)]
*  National Security. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=4.0s)]
*  We were talking offline that, you know, if your neighbor keeps coming over to your lawn [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=5.0s)]
*  and soiling your lawn, eventually you've got to stop them from doing it. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=9.4s)]
*  And so Israel faces that very plight right now. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=13.48s)]
*  Unless it stops Iran from its malign activities, it's going to face an existential threat [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  every day. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=25.04s)]
*  And I don't know how people in Israel continue to live with that. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=26.52s)]
*  You're totally right. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=31.92s)]
*  Listen, I agreed with Jake Sullivan right there. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=32.92s)]
*  I caught the words that he said it was a significant escalation by Iran. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  And the National Security Advisor is correct. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=41.68s)]
*  That's the right way to frame this. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=43.84s)]
*  You know, we can't get used to the fact that Iran sends over 100 ballistic missiles and [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=45.44s)]
*  other missiles and weaponry into Israel. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=50.64s)]
*  And in April when this happened, when I was with you, John and Sandra, I said that they [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=53.6s)]
*  had sort of they had crossed the Rubicon, they had crossed a red line. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=59.080000000000005s)]
*  Iran in April had never physically attacked within Israel from within Iran. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=63.88s)]
*  And so we can't make that seem like commonplace, like something that is normal. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=68.76s)]
*  Just because Iran doesn't necessarily have the capability to hit where they want doesn't [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=73.28s)]
*  mean they tried. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=77.84s)]
*  As the National Security Advisor just pointed out, it is with the assistance of the United [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=79.06s)]
*  States military and our assets in the region that it looks like we were able to help foil [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=83.78s)]
*  some of this. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=88.78s)]
*  But again, the malign intent, the ill intent to kill Israeli and American civilians in [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=89.78s)]
*  Israel was there by the Islamic Republic of Iran. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=96.06s)]
*  They are the ones escalating. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=100.18s)]
*  They are the ones that have dragged this out into a major all out war. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=101.76s)]
*  It's time that they are held accountable for the terror that they have inflicted in the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=105.56s)]
*  region for over 40 years. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=109.44s)]
*  This has not just happened in the last year or in the last two weeks. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=112.44s)]
*  This has happened for over 40 years. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=115.48s)]
*  This is a theocratic revolutionary regime at its core. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=117.14s)]
*  The myth of the Iranian moderate is dead. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=121.3s)]
*  You know, Morgan, he had some news there. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=124.04s)]
*  He obviously confirming what we were already reporting that Iran launched nearly apparently [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=127.08s)]
*  the numbers just under 200 missiles towards these targets in Israel. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=132.24s)]
*  We heard him promise consequences. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=136.96s)]
*  He also confirmed they do not know of any deaths in Israel as a response to this. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=139.68s)]
*  He went on to say this attack appears to be defeated and ineffective. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=144.54000000000002s)]
*  And it'll be interesting to see how that is analyzed if indeed this does lead to escalation, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=150.76000000000002s)]
*  Morgan. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=156.44s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely, Sandra. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=158.44s)]
*  My opinion, the escalation has been there and the Trump administration. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=162.0s)]
*  This is a key point under Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=165.96s)]
*  We had a policy that if the United States was attacked by Iran's proxy groups, their [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=169.28s)]
*  terrorist groups in the region, we would count it as an attack from Iran itself. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=174.68s)]
*  It's high time that Israel and the United States started treating Iran that way. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=178.76s)]
*  I would note that reports are out that the Shia militia groups in Iraq that Iran fund, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=182.68s)]
*  trains and equips as much as they do Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis, that those Shia [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=188.32s)]
*  militia groups are saying that they're going to target U.S. assets in Iraq as well. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=192.44s)]
*  This comes during the middle of a negotiation that Brett McGurk and the White House is making [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=197.0s)]
*  with Iraq to withdraw U.S. forces within the next two years. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=201.64000000000001s)]
*  So there's a lot going on around the region. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=205.68s)]
*  I can tell you that we would be in a different position if we didn't spend the last four [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=208.32s)]
*  years giving billions of dollars in sanctions relief. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=212.58s)]
*  And, by the way, within the first year of the Trump administration, those missiles that [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=215.22s)]
*  you see, we released those sanctions at the U.N. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=218.94000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=222.18s)]
*  Well, there's been this big argument about what Iran is using the money for. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=223.18s)]
*  Maybe if it just frees up funds to buy weapons, that's what it's doing. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=227.22000000000003s)]
*  Morgan, good to see you. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZxGGTVLv40&t=229.98000000000002s)]
