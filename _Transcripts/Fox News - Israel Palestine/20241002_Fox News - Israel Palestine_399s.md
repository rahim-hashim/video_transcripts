# Chilling IDF photo raises questions about Hamas leader's fate
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo)
*  So this now is a live look, 434 in the afternoon, Western Wall, old city of Jerusalem. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=0.0s)]
*  It's sundown. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=7.36s)]
*  They'll begin Rosh Hashanah and celebrate the New Year in Jewish religious tradition. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=8.36s)]
*  Coming out here right now, we'll let you know what's happening over the past 24 hours and [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=14.6s)]
*  give you a sense of the region and what's been transpiring and what really may come [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=18.52s)]
*  next with Keith Kellogg in a moment here. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=24.16s)]
*  Here's our area of focus that we watched yesterday. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=27.32s)]
*  This is really Iran's forefront battle. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=30.2s)]
*  For some time now, you've had the Gaza Strip with Hamas and then Hezbollah in the north [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=34.76s)]
*  and then you've got the Houthis down here in Yemen firing as they like. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=40.6s)]
*  And then here's, well, that could be the main target. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=45.2s)]
*  That's the country of Iran that we watched yesterday afternoon, live in the afternoon. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=48.64s)]
*  There's a lot of stuff on this screen here. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=53.76s)]
*  I'll draw your attention to Israeli Air Force in the air, Naval Defense there in the east [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=57.04s)]
*  of Mediterranean. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=61.2s)]
*  What you see in green right here is what's known as the Iron Dome. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=62.68s)]
*  It has the ability to fire a system that can take out an incoming rocket or missile to [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=65.94s)]
*  an altitude of six miles. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  Pretty good. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=74.72s)]
*  What you see here in blue is David's sling. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=76.32s)]
*  That has the ability to take out a missile or rocket at an altitude of 10 miles. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=81.42s)]
*  Pretty good. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=87.58s)]
*  This is the Aero system here, okay, in yellow. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=88.66s)]
*  It has the ability to go to 100 miles. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=92.74000000000001s)]
*  And a lot of that was enforced yesterday by the Israeli military and how they used it [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=96.86s)]
*  to defend their country. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=101.14s)]
*  This is Isfahan. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=102.46000000000001s)]
*  It's a missile complex, been set up for decades. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=103.46000000000001s)]
*  That is the main source as to where the Iranians make their ballistic missiles. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=106.7s)]
*  Is that the target? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=111.82000000000001s)]
*  Keith Kellogg can answer that. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=112.82000000000001s)]
*  Fox News contributor, retired U.S. Army general, and sir, good morning to you. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=114.10000000000001s)]
*  What does Benjamin Netanyahu do next with regard to Iran, sir? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=118.12s)]
*  Yeah, Bill, Dana, thanks for having me. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=123.94s)]
*  Look, he's got a lot of options, and I think he can go a lot of different directions. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=126.7s)]
*  He is going to respond Netanyahu is. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=130.88s)]
*  You know, I'm always a little bit surprised that senior leaders or national security experts [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=133.1s)]
*  don't listen to people. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=138.22s)]
*  If you listen to what Netanyahu said when he was at the U.N. General Assembly and he [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=139.66s)]
*  talked about Iran, you know, he talked about Moses, and he closed with the book of Samuel. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=143.94s)]
*  They look at this fight against Iran as a biblical issue, a long-term issue. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=148.78s)]
*  And when you look at Iran, you have to drop down, and then you talk Hezbollah and the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=153.9s)]
*  Houthis and Hamas. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=157.9s)]
*  But their frustration is they're actually fighting this fight by themselves. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=159.94s)]
*  And you just mentioned that when you showed the map of all the directions that they're [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=163.54s)]
*  fighting. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=167.14000000000001s)]
*  But they're going to respond, and it's very clear they're going to respond. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=168.14000000000001s)]
*  Some of the things you pick up, the tells that I'm picking up is, for example, just [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=171.22s)]
*  the other day they took out four air defense sites in Syria. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=175.14000000000001s)]
*  They call it SEAD, S-E-A-D, Suppression of Enemy Air Defense. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=178.94s)]
*  What they're doing is opening up a lane, a lane into Iran. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=183.26s)]
*  So where are they going to go? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=186.3s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=187.3s)]
*  I think they're going to go hard. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=188.5s)]
*  And when they go hard, you're looking at the potential for Esfahan. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=189.86s)]
*  Are you looking at their nuclear sites that they want to go after? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=193.82000000000002s)]
*  Because when you hear what Blinken said about them getting ready for a breakout, the Israelis [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=197.26000000000002s)]
*  have said, we're going to have to do this on our own, because the United States has [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=201.42000000000002s)]
*  said, well, we want equilibrium, meaning that we want everything to calm down. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=205.54000000000002s)]
*  It's not going to calm down. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=209.26000000000002s)]
*  We should actually reverse that and say, no, we're full score behind them. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=210.66s)]
*  When you look at the Iron Dome that you just mentioned, those three interconnected systems, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=214.34s)]
*  the fact is, that's also a U.S. system, U.S. built system, U.S. and Israeli built system [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=217.94s)]
*  with Israeli IAI helped build that. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=222.66s)]
*  That's a great system, but it's been very, very effective, and it's given them a lot [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=225.34s)]
*  of latitude, meaning the Israelis, because the Iranians have now failed twice. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  And I think if the Iranians, if you look at Hamané, the Supreme Leader, he's probably [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=232.98000000000002s)]
*  going, this may not be such a good deal. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=236.66s)]
*  But I think the Israelis are going to do something, they're going to do something hard, in a very [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=239.22s)]
*  near term. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=243.18s)]
*  OK, sir. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=244.18s)]
*  A couple of things here that involve us, really. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=245.18s)]
*  I have to look at the list here. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=247.5s)]
*  Accelerator Nuclear Enrichment Program, shortening the time to get nukes to perhaps weeks. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=248.5s)]
*  Hacking the U.S. President's election, both the Harris and Trump campaigns, victims of that. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=254.82000000000002s)]
*  You got an Iranian plot to assassinate the former president, that's ongoing. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=258.86s)]
*  That threat is still out there. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=262.54s)]
*  And then we came upon this. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=264.34000000000003s)]
*  This is a picture of the IDF. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=265.78000000000003s)]
*  I want our viewers, OK, this is going over Jerusalem and the old city yesterday, which [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=268.66s)]
*  the Israelis were like, you know, you're trying to take us out. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=273.94s)]
*  Well, I mean, this is a spot that's sacred to Jews and Muslims and Christians alike. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=276.18s)]
*  Go to call for number three. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=280.98s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=282.14s)]
*  So this was an IDF picture, OK, with a question mark over the face of Sinwar. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=283.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=293.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=295.42s)]
*  There it is in the upper right hand corner, sir. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=296.42s)]
*  Hang on one moment. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=298.06s)]
*  So we do not know about his fate in Gaza. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=299.06s)]
*  Correct. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=301.62s)]
*  Why would the Israelis being so particular about their own secrecy, why would this get out? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=302.7s)]
*  Well, I think they're just sending a message. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=309.9s)]
*  Basically, you know, Sinwar made the comment that he's willing to do some type of peace [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=311.58s)]
*  talks as long as the Israelis can guarantee his life. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=315.62s)]
*  The Israelis are not going to do that. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=318.7s)]
*  Sinwar is really the last of the leaders when you think about it, because they've taken [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=320.22s)]
*  out the number one. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=323.62s)]
*  Sinwar was the one who replaced the number one. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=325.02s)]
*  When you look at Hanei after they took him out, and then you look at Nasrallah being taken out. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=327.02s)]
*  You look at Shukar being taken out with Hezbollah. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=331.98s)]
*  They've kind of gone down the list. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=335.14s)]
*  And he's the last one. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=336.34s)]
*  When you look at the leadership out there, there's no leadership. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=337.9s)]
*  There's no leadership in Hamas anymore. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=340.54s)]
*  There's no leadership in Hezbollah anymore. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=342.54s)]
*  In fact, when you look at it, you're kind of saying, well, who's running Lebanon? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=344.62s)]
*  And the only one running Lebanon, and they've got a prime minister, Makhadi, but they don't [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=348.5s)]
*  even have a president there. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=352.46s)]
*  So they've kind of taken the, gone down the list and taken these people out, and they've [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=353.7s)]
*  kind of reset the battlefield. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=357.7s)]
*  And the person, the group, the organization, the leader that's still standing is Netanyahu [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=359.46000000000004s)]
*  in Israel. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=364.62s)]
*  And again, I keep going back to it, Bill, this is when we have an opportunity to stand [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=365.62s)]
*  fully behind Israel, because I think what will happen that gives us a gap, it creates [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=370.86s)]
*  a gap for us to leverage in the future some type of peace deal into the future with the [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=375.78000000000003s)]
*  Palestinians, with the Israelis, helping and using the Saudis as well. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=381.58000000000004s)]
*  But we haven't taken advantage of that at all. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=386.18s)]
*  We just kind of keep saying the same thing. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=388.34s)]
*  General, I mean, what a shame it would be if peace broke out. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=389.94s)]
*  I mean, the world would change. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvBGGmBy9bo&t=392.61999999999995s)]
