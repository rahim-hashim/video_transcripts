# Israel to implement 4-hour fighting pauses in Hamas war
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU)
*  The United States is finally hitting back at Iran-backed proxy groups, those paid terrorists [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=0.0s)]
*  by Iran in the Middle East, and finally unleashing a second round of airstrikes, but continued [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=7.7s)]
*  argument that that's really the lightest thing that we can do to the enemy. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=14.780000000000001s)]
*  Like it's the least amount of effort. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=18.78s)]
*  The Pentagon is calling this latest strike an act of self-defense. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=21.14s)]
*  After U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria were targeted, a staggering 42 times in 21 days. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=25.98s)]
*  You see what I'm saying here? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=32.66s)]
*  42 times, we hit them twice, hit a couple buildings with some ammo in it. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=33.66s)]
*  This is Outnumbered. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=38.6s)]
*  I'm Harris Faulkner, here with my co-host, Emily Campagno, and also joining us today, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=39.6s)]
*  Fox News contributor Tammy Bruce, Culture Plus Group co-founder and CEO, Lily Gilballetta, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=43.86s)]
*  and former New York Congressman and gubernatorial candidate, Lee Zeldin. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=50.540000000000006s)]
*  Great to have you both here. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=54.38s)]
*  All right, the Pentagon says this latest strike took out an ammunition and weapons storage [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=55.660000000000004s)]
*  facility located in eastern Syria. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=61.300000000000004s)]
*  That depot belonged to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard, and its contents were used to constantly [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=63.84s)]
*  target U.S. military men and women around the region. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  A senior military official says this, what we blew up inside were bad things. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=72.62s)]
*  It could have been rockets, could have been drones, could have been artillery shells, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=78.1s)]
*  certainly whatever it was, was what was being used against our forces in the region. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=82.62s)]
*  And we're now learning more about that most recent attack against our U.S. and coalition [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=88.26s)]
*  forces. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=93.46000000000001s)]
*  Defense officials are saying a multi-rocket attack targeted a U.S. outpost in Iraq yesterday. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=94.46000000000001s)]
*  The strike happened near the Baghdad Embassy complex, and thankfully, no one was hurt. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=100.5s)]
*  The Biden administration now says Israel is going to implement a daily four-hour pause [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=105.82000000000001s)]
*  in fighting in the northern Gaza Strip, where the heaviest fighting has been going on because [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=111.8s)]
*  they're targeting Hamas, who's hiding among citizens, or at least trying to. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=115.08s)]
*  The NSC spokesperson, John Kirby, says the United States won't hesitate to launch more [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=119.72s)]
*  strikes if attacks on our troops continue. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=124.96s)]
*  I was certainly concerned about additional attacks on our troops and our facilities in [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  Iraq and Syria. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=132.88s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=133.88s)]
*  Since our last set of strikes, there have been additional ones, which is why we took [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=134.88s)]
*  retaliatory strike last night to send a strong message to these proxy groups and to the Iranian [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=139.76s)]
*  Revolutionary Guard Corps, the Quds Force, that these are unacceptable. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=145.16s)]
*  Now they'll have some choices to make. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=148.96s)]
*  And if they continue to choose to hit our troops, if they continue to launch these rocket [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=150.96s)]
*  and drone attacks, then we'll continue to do what we need to do to protect ourselves. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=154.4s)]
*  It's amazing you can say that with a straight face. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=158.48s)]
*  If somebody hits somebody 21 times, do you expect them only to get punched twice? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=161.5s)]
*  It's 42 times. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and Iran's not going to stop. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=166.35999999999999s)]
*  They don't fear that type of a consequence. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=169.12s)]
*  They would view strategically that as just collateral damage. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=172.24s)]
*  At some point, where you have the depot in that other country, it might get attacked. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=176.56s)]
*  My background as a militaryman in my 21st year still serve now. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=182.44s)]
*  I learned a long time ago about the rule of fire supremacy. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=185.56s)]
*  They say everyone bullet fired at you, you fire three back. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=189.04000000000002s)]
*  I'm against war. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  I don't support war. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=193.46s)]
*  With regards to Iran, if you want any type of instrument of national power to work other [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=195.56s)]
*  than the military option, you have to have the military option on the table. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=201.60000000000002s)]
*  Iran doesn't fear a strongly worded letter. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=205.94000000000003s)]
*  When you throw down a red line and you show that you have a willingness to actually enforce [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=209.56s)]
*  that red line, and it is a red line that Iran actually fears, then they start thinking a [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=213.32000000000002s)]
*  little differently on their next act. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=218.88000000000002s)]
*  And it brings me back to when we took out Qasem Soleimani. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=221.08s)]
*  We were very clear to Iran, the Trump administration was, in what the consequences would be if [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=224.6s)]
*  Iran in return targeted U.S. service members. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=229.79999999999998s)]
*  It was clear that we were going to be carrying out airstrikes in Iran. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  And it was Iran knowing that President Trump meant that, that they didn't actually follow [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=239.0s)]
*  through with their most severe threats. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=244.51999999999998s)]
*  That is off the table right now and it shouldn't be. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=246.6s)]
*  All right, real quickly with your military acumen, a four hour pause with a three hour [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=249.12s)]
*  heads up. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=253.3s)]
*  I mean, that sounds like you're making it up. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=254.3s)]
*  It's true though. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=257.38s)]
*  For Hamas strategically, this is a gift. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=258.38s)]
*  Every day, by the way. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=262.5s)]
*  And to have that type of predictability, to have freedom of movement, to be able to reposition, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=264.3s)]
*  one of Israel's strengths right now is that Hamas doesn't know when they're going to get [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=270.3s)]
*  attacked, how they're going to get attacked, where they're going to get attacked. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=275.5s)]
*  If you give, if you set a few hours of the day where they're going to have that freedom [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=279.38s)]
*  of movement, you're going to be giving a gift that allows Hamas to gain a strategic advantage [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=283.38s)]
*  that it does not have now. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=288.38s)]
*  Well, and we already know that they're hoarding fuel, they're hoarding resources for the tunnels [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=289.38s)]
*  right now to keep their own leadership and anybody who's not on like billion dollar trips [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=294.85999999999996s)]
*  to Vegas or wherever the heck they were going on that plane, all that leadership from Hamas. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=299.32s)]
*  Anybody who's still down there with our hostages, our citizens and citizens around the world, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=303.88s)]
*  so they're already doing that. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=308.66s)]
*  This will give them the opportunity to go out of those tunnels, potentially go regroup, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=310.18s)]
*  meet with their homies and kill more people and strategize against the Israeli forces. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=315.38s)]
*  Yeah, and you know, you and I were talking about this yesterday, Harris, that it seems [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=319.66s)]
*  to me that the erosion of our ability to deter any of our enemies or any of our enemies' [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=323.26s)]
*  allies means that not only, yes, have we taken the military options off the table, but yes, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=329.9s)]
*  we are projecting weakness. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=334.64s)]
*  When we are attacked over 40 times with U.S. officials confirming that it was with an intent [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=336.34s)]
*  to kill U.S. servicemen and women and then we respond with a couple hours warning, take [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=341.65999999999997s)]
*  out a couple rifles, maybe a couple grenades in a warehouse, there's no ability to deter [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=347.86s)]
*  if we are not responding in kind. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=352.26s)]
*  And with everything that this administration does, they explain it by saying, well, there's [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=354.76s)]
*  a fear of escalation. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=359.26s)]
*  But it seems to me that this behavior surrounding the fear of escalation means we are further [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=360.96s)]
*  in Hamas' interest. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=366.22s)]
*  That's the point. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=367.90000000000003s)]
*  That without taking out these proxies once and for all, without achieving a position [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=368.90000000000003s)]
*  of actual strength. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=373.74s)]
*  Like ISIS. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=374.74s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=375.74s)]
*  Without all of that, we are simply allowing Hamas to further and hoard their weapons and [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=376.74s)]
*  supplies and continue doing what they're doing. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=381.08000000000004s)]
*  An inch at a time means we are giving it to the enemy. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=383.54s)]
*  There is nothing about this position right now that is strength forward and no fear that [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=386.70000000000005s)]
*  we project will move our advancements any further. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=390.98s)]
*  Lily, how bad do you think it is for Biden right now that he would give in like this [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=393.94s)]
*  to the far left? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=399.42s)]
*  Because you saw that Rashida Tlaib, now she's not saying from the river to the sea because [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=400.76s)]
*  she got censored for that. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=404.42s)]
*  Now she's got the big poster out on the Capitol Hill steps who showed last hour of they want [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=405.86s)]
*  to cease fire now. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=410.62s)]
*  And what does Biden negotiate? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=412.1s)]
*  Technically a ceasefire every day at whatever time for four hours with the three hour heads [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=414.42s)]
*  up windows. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=418.18s)]
*  You get your lunch before you kill again. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=419.18s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=420.5s)]
*  I need to understand these are not just tactical military decisions of the moment. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=421.58s)]
*  The balance of power in this region is a stake and the world is watching every superpower [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=426.18s)]
*  and every attack from Iran is emboldening signals to their allies. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=433.1s)]
*  And it's no longer just Hamas. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=438.9s)]
*  It's Hezbollah, it's ISIS, it's everyone that is a sympathizer of this hate for the West, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=440.9s)]
*  which is very concerning. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=447.22s)]
*  What's even more concerning to me is that when you look at polls and data, America's [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=448.46s)]
*  divided in our sentiment towards retaliating, which probably puts the president in that [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=452.58s)]
*  political dance of diplomacy of which one is power, which one is actually strength. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=457.58s)]
*  But at the end of the day, for that type of organization, only power with the strongest [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=462.98s)]
*  of force is what works because words just come and go. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=469.46s)]
*  Yeah, I'm looking for a little less conversation, a little bit more whack-a-mole. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=472.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, what's fascinating here is that you've got, it's almost like leaving a tip. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=476.5s)]
*  You can leave a nickel for a tip and it says something very dramatic to the person you're [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=483.54s)]
*  tipping, worse than not leaving any tip at all. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=489.74s)]
*  It's a statement. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=493.38s)]
*  It's a statement when you leave a nickel for a tip. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=494.78s)]
*  It is a statement, the nature of the actions we're taking and to everyone else, we're [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=497.86s)]
*  too afraid to kill Iranians. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=502.78s)]
*  This administration has now managed to kill more American service members in Afghanistan [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=506.06s)]
*  because of their plans than we have the people targeting again our service people in the [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=512.42s)]
*  Middle East. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=517.62s)]
*  That is what the problem is here. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=519.02s)]
*  It's almost like striking an aspirin factory or sending a missile into the wrong car, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=521.06s)]
*  a car of an American aid worker because you wanted to show you were busy in Afghanistan. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=526.54s)]
*  That's what this is and will lead to more slaughter, more murder and I don't know, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=532.46s)]
*  a nuclear exchange? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=537.6600000000001s)]
*  We don't know, but it's Biden's fault. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=538.94s)]
*  You know, I don't say the phrase boots on the ground because there are people in those [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=541.1s)]
*  boots and I know people refer to them that way, but what you just said brings home the [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=544.5s)]
*  fact that we see them, we see you serving as a person. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=548.5400000000001s)]
*  We're grateful for your service. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=553.86s)]
*  We see those military men and women. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=555.38s)]
*  I don't know if from some of the high perches of our government they see them that way because [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=557.62s)]
*  if they did, they'd be hitting back mighty hard right now to protect them. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKN4pB3C9xU&t=562.1s)]
