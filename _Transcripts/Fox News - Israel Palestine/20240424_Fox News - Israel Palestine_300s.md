# Columbia negotiating with anti-Israel protesters as they refuse to vacate
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs)
*  A camp filled with Israel-hating protesters supposed to be gone last night at midnight, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=0.0s)]
*  not so. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=7.68s)]
*  That's because Columbia University has given the occupiers extra time, 48 hours, to take [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=8.68s)]
*  down their tents. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=13.94s)]
*  Well, we may know just who's in control on that campus, and it doesn't look like it's [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=15.32s)]
*  Columbia's president. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=20.12s)]
*  The school is forcing Jewish students and others who do not feel safe on campus to learn [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=21.86s)]
*  online. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  The New York Post cover, Columbia surrenders. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=27.32s)]
*  Jewish students on campus are in a horrible position. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=31.32s)]
*  Go to school in fear and danger, or stay locked down on your device to get that very expensive [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=34.4s)]
*  Ivy League degree in your own apartment. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=39.980000000000004s)]
*  I'm Harris Faulkner. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  You are in the Faulkner Focus. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=43.84s)]
*  New York City saw more protesting and hate on the streets last night. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=45.6s)]
*  Look at this video. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=48.96s)]
*  Alright, you've been hearing us say it on this program. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=49.96s)]
*  There is some uniformity in the tents and certain things about how these people are [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=60.2s)]
*  protesting. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=66.12s)]
*  Growing concerns now that professionals and big far left dollars are promoting this huge [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=67.12s)]
*  wave of anti-Semitism. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=72.64s)]
*  The New York Police Department, City Mayor Eric Adams, and students whose campuses have [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=74.68s)]
*  been taken over, not just Columbia, but others too, all pointing to outside agitators. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=79.2s)]
*  I think somebody's funding this. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=85.56s)]
*  Also, there are professional agitators in there that are just looking for something [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=87.56s)]
*  to be agitated about, which is a protest. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=93.88s)]
*  There are people who are here, they latch on to any protest. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=96.0s)]
*  There are people inside those tents on the campus who are not students, who have no affiliation [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=100.44s)]
*  with the university, who are chanting to attack and kill Jewish students. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=105.24s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=112.36s)]
*  We saw the anti-Jewish movement spark at Columbia University. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=114.24s)]
*  And now it's happening at more than half of our nation's top rated universities. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=118.52s)]
*  Look at the map. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=122.67999999999999s)]
*  I mean, most of the East Coast. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=125.52s)]
*  One Columbia student on Focus yesterday described that situation as toxic and unstable for Jewish [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=126.6s)]
*  students. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=134.24s)]
*  You just heard from him. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=135.24s)]
*  And now New York Congresswoman Claudia Tenney is in Focus. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=136.24s)]
*  We'll get to her in a moment. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=139.36s)]
*  Let's begin with Fox News correspondent C.B. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=140.92000000000002s)]
*  Cotton, who's at Columbia. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=142.96s)]
*  And C.B., you've been in the middle of all of this when it got pretty tough out there. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=144.44s)]
*  I have, Harris, and it still continues today. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=149.84s)]
*  You know, Columbia leadership may be trying to appease both sides with these student negotiations, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=153.44s)]
*  which come as more than a thousand grad students, lecturers and professors from across the globe [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=159.6s)]
*  pledged to boycott Columbia University. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=165.68s)]
*  They feel these student protesters are peaceful and they think the police should have never [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=168.68s)]
*  been called in in the first place. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=173.12s)]
*  But Harris, an Israeli Jewish professor who was barred from entering campus earlier this [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  week, has this warning about what's going on here. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=180.12s)]
*  You start off slow and you see that you don't have face any consequences. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=184.84s)]
*  So you amp up the heat more and more and more. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=188.72s)]
*  And you amp up the heat until the other side gets to a breaking point and starts negotiating [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=191.4s)]
*  with you. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=196.4s)]
*  This is how terrorism works. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=197.4s)]
*  The university tells us negotiations continued after students agreed to remove a significant [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=201.04s)]
*  number of tents and people not affiliated with Columbia University from the encampment. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=206.92s)]
*  A Columbia spokesperson also tells us students have agreed to prohibit discriminatory or [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=212.32s)]
*  harassing language at the encampment, which several Jewish students feel is the epicenter [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=217.88s)]
*  of hateful rhetoric. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=223.20000000000002s)]
*  I think a lot of them are scared given the I think the violent rhetoric of the pro-Palestinian [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=225.6s)]
*  movement that's on campus and outside our doors constantly. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=232.92000000000002s)]
*  There is a lot more fear on campus within the last week, certainly. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=236.52s)]
*  People are now trying to trace the money trail, as you mentioned, Harris, because similar [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=242.4s)]
*  tents are spotted at campuses sometimes separated by thousands of miles. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=246.04s)]
*  The left of the screen shows aerial footage from protests at NYU, the right from protests [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=250.8s)]
*  at the University of Michigan. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=256.84s)]
*  And off campus, droves of pro-Palestinian demonstrators continue to rally in support [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=258.76s)]
*  of students where we hear chants like this. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=263.72s)]
*  Israel, go to hell! [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=266.72s)]
*  Israel, go to hell! [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=268.72s)]
*  It is right to rebel! [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=270.72s)]
*  It is right to rebel! [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=272.72s)]
*  Israel, go to hell! [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=275.44000000000005s)]
*  Israel, go to hell! [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=277.44000000000005s)]
*  Harris House Speaker Mike Johnson is set to meet with Columbia Jewish students today and [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=281.44000000000005s)]
*  hold a news or after we will be monitoring. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=285.16s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=288.08000000000004s)]
*  Well, I heard you call it pro-Palestinian and that's fair if you read the signs, but [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=289.08000000000004s)]
*  they were screaming Israel, go to hell. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=293.0s)]
*  I mean, that sounds more anti-Israel to me. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=294.88000000000005s)]
*  CB, thank you very much. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS5cYXlwdxs&t=298.44000000000005s)]
