# National security analyst warns this is 'the only path' for Hamas
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [May 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSjb1reoUow)
*  For more on the war in Gaza, let's bring in Dr. Rebecca Grant. She's a senior fellow at the Lexington Institute and a national security analyst. Dr. Grant, thank you for joining us this morning. I want to get your sense of what's happened in Gaza, in Israel over the last 24, 36 hours. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSjb1reoUow&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, my first reaction is that if Hamas would accept a ceasefire, none of this would have happened. Instead, what took place was that Hamas, trying to show they still can operate in Gaza, launched a relatively small attack, but worrying because it came from multiple locations. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSjb1reoUow&t=16.08s)]
*  Israel was right to go ahead and target those two Hamas operatives. They had, that was a legitimate military target. Unfortunately, it led to the fire that you see. And again, if Hamas would accept the ceasefire that Egypt and Qatar and the U.S. and Israel and so many others want them to accept, we wouldn't see any of this going on. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSjb1reoUow&t=37.08s)]
*  And again, I think it's time for Biden and Israel to find a way to wrap up this military operation quickly and decisively restore Israel's security. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSjb1reoUow&t=60.08s)]
*  And the Biden administration is applying that pressure. There's also pressure with the international community. And within the Israeli government, you've got Benny Gantz, who's part of the coalition there or part of the war council there. He's threatening to walk unless Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu comes up with what he calls a credible plan for the after-war peace of all of this. Where is Israel on that? And is there a credible plan for what comes next in Gaza? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSjb1reoUow&t=71.08s)]
*  Well, one piece of that plan is already in operation, and that is that army pier in Gaza. Israel is manning the land side of that, bringing in trucks of humanitarian relief. So that piece is there. But there was such an expectation, Rich, that the ceasefire would come to pass and then it would be about getting some hostages back, starting humanitarian relief and trying to move on to a permanent settlement. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSjb1reoUow&t=102.08s)]
*  Instead, we see this activity. And even though the IDF has actually moved one of its five units back from the Rafa area, the fact is bottom line, Hamas only reacts to military pressure. And so Israel will keep that pressure on no matter what the International Court for Justice has to say about it. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSjb1reoUow&t=128.08s)]
*  And even in the face of these very odd warrants requested by the ICC. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSjb1reoUow&t=148.08s)]
*  Yeah, you mentioned the ICC here. That's the International Criminal Court. It has moved forward warrants against the defense minister, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, also for some Hamas officials. Here's what Congressman Jared Moskowitz had to say about that. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSjb1reoUow&t=157.08s)]
*  This is totally political. The ICC is irrelevant. They have no jurisdiction. We might as well call them the Harry Potter Ministry of Magic. They're irrelevant because Israel is not a party to their treaty. And so this is pressure, unfortunately, from the international community that wants to see no more Israel. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSjb1reoUow&t=172.08s)]
*  So what about that pressure from the, quote, Ministry of Magic, Rebecca? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSjb1reoUow&t=190.08s)]
*  Well, the congressman is exactly right. And the ICC prosecutor Khan has tried, is wants to put out warrants both for the Hamas leaders, Sinwar and Al-Maziri, and for the Israeli government. So this is a non-starter. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSjb1reoUow&t=196.08s)]
*  He's a bit of a publicity hound. This is the same individual who's put out a warrant for Putin, which I agree with. But it's no more likely to change the situation on the ground. And so I think the ICC in considering weighing in is simply making the problem more difficult. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSjb1reoUow&t=212.08s)]
*  What has to happen is Hamas has to agree with Qatar and Egypt's support to a ceasefire so that we can begin to see some progress. I mean, that, I think everyone in the region understands that Hamas is getting very, very isolated. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSjb1reoUow&t=228.08s)]
*  But Hamas, they don't agree to the Oslo Accords. They don't agree to any of this international stuff. And so it's just going to take the right blend of military pressure and that behind-the-scenes diplomatic pressure. It has got to be ceasefire. That is the only path. And it's up to Hamas when that happens. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSjb1reoUow&t=243.08s)]
*  Dr. Rebecca Grant, thanks so much for joining us this morning. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSjb1reoUow&t=259.08000000000004s)]
