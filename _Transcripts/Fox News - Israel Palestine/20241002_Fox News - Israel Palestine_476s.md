# Israel vows retaliation after 'unprecedented' Iranian missile attack
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE)
*  We are back with a Fox News alert right now the IDF is sending even more troops [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=0.0s)]
*  into southern Lebanon after Iran unleashed nearly 200 ballistic missiles [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  on Israel yesterday. Nate Foy live on the ground in Tel Aviv with the latest. Nate. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  Hey guys good morning so Israel and Hezbollah are continuing to exchange [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=16.0s)]
*  heavy fire across the border this morning just one day after the biggest [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  ballistic missile strike in history a sign that the war continues. Just a [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=24.96s)]
*  really scary night last night across central and southern Israel as you see [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  180 ballistic missiles launched by Iran into Israel many of them shot down by [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=36.56s)]
*  Israel's air defense and international partners in the region including the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  United States. The big question here guys is what is Israel going to do in [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=48.32s)]
*  response to this several Israeli officials including Prime Minister [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=54.28s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu say that Iran will pay a significant price for this. We know [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  that 100 homes in a town north of Tel Aviv are damaged after being hit by [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=63.34s)]
*  falling shrapnel. The attack sent millions of people into bomb shelters [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=67.84s)]
*  including one man that we talked to who was injured while fighting for the IDF [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=72.0s)]
*  in Gaza. Listen to this. What happened with your injury how you lost the lower [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=76.2s)]
*  part of your hand? I had Hamas terrorist shot on us an RPG and I got injured. It's hard for me to [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=81.08s)]
*  look at because in time like this it's very difficult to deal with my situation [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=90.44s)]
*  in my country's situations. Yeah he said that he was so calm because he was so [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  confident in the country's air defense but check this out guys literally [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=104.08s)]
*  minutes before Iran's attack a terror attack happened in Jaffa in Tel Aviv two [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=108.62s)]
*  terrorists opened fire on Israelis riding the light rail train through the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=114.58s)]
*  city. Listen to this. When the train stopped and opened its doors the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=119.0s)]
*  terrorists walked inside started firing their automatic weapons walked back [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=123.94s)]
*  outside and continued their killing spree. Take a look at this new video from [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=127.94s)]
*  Beirut. Israel continued its airstrikes in the Dahya neighborhood overnight [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=134.7s)]
*  targeting Hezbollah's weapons facilities that's the same neighborhood where they [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=140.01999999999998s)]
*  took out Hassan Nasrallah in an airstrike on Friday and as you mentioned [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=143.76s)]
*  as Israel continues its limited ground offensive into southern Lebanon they are [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=148.45999999999998s)]
*  calling up additional troops to supplement the ones already there this [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=153.42s)]
*  morning as we await Israel's response and as we wait for that Iran has already [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=157.57999999999998s)]
*  said that if Israel responds then they will respond in turn so it looks like [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=162.94s)]
*  we could have a couple busy days here we'll send it back to you. All right [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=168.94s)]
*  Nate Foy live for us in Tel Aviv you are certainly right about that Nate thank [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=172.14s)]
*  you so much. Let's bring in Enya Kravine who is currently in a safe room of her [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=175.3s)]
*  home as a result of yesterday's attack she's also the senior director for the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=179.57999999999998s)]
*  defense of democracies. Enya good morning to you thank you so much for [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=183.3s)]
*  joining us following yesterday's events we have a map that shows just how [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=186.7s)]
*  massive this barrage of incoming missiles was I mean it's the entire [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=191.14s)]
*  expanse of Israel where these missiles landed and the air defense systems took [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=196.17999999999998s)]
*  them out so just want to get a sense of what this was like to live through what [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=200.82s)]
*  did you see here feel during this attack? Sure thanks so much for having me so [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=204.73999999999998s)]
*  already on Monday people in Israel were hearing that there were rulers coming [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=212.5s)]
*  out of the US administration that Iran might be considering an attack in the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=217.06s)]
*  coming days and then of course on Tuesday afternoon yesterday afternoon my [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=221.18s)]
*  kids came home from school and they were hanging around the house and I started [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=226.22s)]
*  seeing language coming out of the Israeli media which I've learned to [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=229.82s)]
*  recognize as kind of you know brace yourself essentially the guidance from [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=233.54s)]
*  Homeland Security said in certain areas you can only gather up to so many [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=239.9s)]
*  people stay close to your shelters and then the language from the media [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=244.94s)]
*  started changing and you know the media plays a huge role when they have these [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=248.78s)]
*  attacks which we've seen a couple times from Iran there was one in April and [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=253.06s)]
*  then of course the one yesterday the media starts saying things like be calm [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=257.02s)]
*  if there's a siren go calmly to your shelter don't run they remind people [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=260.94s)]
*  that most of the injuries happen on the way to the shelter so at that point I [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=265.86s)]
*  told my kids to stay close to the house Daniel Higare the IDF spokesman came on [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=271.22s)]
*  the air and said like we were hearing rumors we think something's coming but [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=277.18s)]
*  there's nothing in the air right now in other words stay calm proceed as normal [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=281.18s)]
*  I started putting my kids to bed and then just as we were sort of getting into [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=285.90000000000003s)]
*  the nighttime routine my husband said okay time to get in the safe room we all [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=290.5s)]
*  came downstairs piled into the safe room brought the dog in and turned the news [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=294.78000000000003s)]
*  on and just saw this barrage this unprecedented barrage of ballistic [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=299.86s)]
*  missiles over Israel's capital Jerusalem and Tel Aviv that those were where the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=304.74s)]
*  primary images were coming in so what a thing to live through and we're looking [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=310.02000000000004s)]
*  at images of the Iron Dome the defense system is taking out some of those [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=313.18s)]
*  ballistic missiles Israelis are used to living through these types of things but [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=316.98s)]
*  even this attack the largest from Iran is is a historic event so now Prime [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=322.42s)]
*  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu we're hearing from him directly he is vowing [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=328.42s)]
*  retaliation and there are those and you could put many in the Biden [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=331.9s)]
*  administration in this camp who fear that retaliation will lead to escalation [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=335.21999999999997s)]
*  and then others are saying peace through strength Israel is in this unique window [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=338.98s)]
*  of time where they could destabilize Iran to the point of change so what do [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=342.98s)]
*  you think about that what will and what needs to take place moving forward so [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=348.98s)]
*  it's hard to predict the future but I can say from Israel's perspective Iran [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=355.98s)]
*  has been making a race towards a nuclear weapon for several years and it's only [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=360.62s)]
*  because of Israel's efforts some in cooperation with the US that it hasn't [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=365.62s)]
*  gotten there yet it hasn't achieved this nuclear weapon of course none of [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=370.54s)]
*  Israel's adversaries currently have the ability to destroy the Jewish state with [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=373.86s)]
*  with conventional means there's no there's no military that's going to show [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=379.7s)]
*  up in Israel's borders and destroy the country Israel has the qualitative [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=383.66s)]
*  military edge largely thanks to its strategic alliance with the US but that [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=388.5s)]
*  is where terror comes in and right now Iran's strategy for decades has been to [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=393.82000000000005s)]
*  surround Israel with Iranian proxies and to try to make life unlivable and that [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=399.66s)]
*  is where the heart of the October 7th attack that is what Hezbollah has been [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=404.66s)]
*  doing to Israel's north for the past year and that is what Iran continues to [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=409.1s)]
*  attempt to do so if this escalates Israel's already said that Israel [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=414.1s)]
*  intends to retaliate a significant retaliation for yesterday's garage keep [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=420.22s)]
*  in mind that these ballistic missiles some of them are as big as buses right [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=425.54s)]
*  so you have a hundred and eighty essentially explosive-laden buses [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=430.22s)]
*  falling from the sky it's a miracle that no one was killed one person a [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=434.86s)]
*  Palestinian ironically was killed in the West Bank but no one in Israel was [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=438.84000000000003s)]
*  injured from the attack so this is a significant attack and it deserves a [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=443.48s)]
*  significant response and that's what Israel is now promising and it's even [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=447.48s)]
*  saying that if it continues to escalate that nothing is off the table and Iran's [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=451.6s)]
*  nuclear program might be in Israel's sights right yeah and Israel right now is [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=456.36s)]
*  fighting a three-front war Hamas Hezbollah and the Houthis in Yemen you [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=461.16s)]
*  weaken one of them you weaken the whole regime and that is Israel's goal and [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=465.04s)]
*  thank you so much for joining us we're so glad that you're safe safe we [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=469.76000000000005s)]
*  appreciate your insight as always thank you Todd over to you [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE&t=473.04s)]
