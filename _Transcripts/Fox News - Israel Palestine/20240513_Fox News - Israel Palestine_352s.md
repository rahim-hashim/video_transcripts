# United Nations appears to revise Gaza death toll
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [May 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg)
*  Let's bring in former Trump foreign policy advisor and Fox News contributor Kyron Skinner [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=0.0s)]
*  along with Israeli special operations counterterrorism veteran Aaron Cohen. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=4.04s)]
*  Thank you both for coming on. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=8.16s)]
*  We always appreciate it. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  We know that withholding, Aaron Cohen, to you, withholding weapons from Israel is detrimental [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=11.08s)]
*  to Israel. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=15.48s)]
*  It's beneficial for Hamas. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=16.48s)]
*  It's amazing to me because Secretary of State Antony Blinken says that he thinks maybe Hamas [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=17.92s)]
*  might be the best answer. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=22.96s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=24.28s)]
*  Watch this answer. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=25.28s)]
*  Israel has not acted in a manner that's consistent with international humanitarian law. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=27.0s)]
*  A lot of armed Hamas will be left no matter what they do in Ra'a. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=30.4s)]
*  Or if they leave and get out of Gaza, as we believe they need to do, then you're going [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=34.32s)]
*  to have a vacuum and a vacuum that's likely to be filled by chaos, by anarchy, and ultimately [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=39.96s)]
*  by Hamas again. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=44.28s)]
*  So I guess what he's saying is they just stop. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=46.08s)]
*  Just stop what you're doing, everything right now, and just go back to the way it was. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=48.44s)]
*  Trace, the only reason why Ra'a is the center of the remaining battalions of Hamas is because [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=51.6s)]
*  Israel has conducted the Sir Lachatz or the pressure cooker campaign, which forced all [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=57.96s)]
*  of the remnants of the terror group into Ra'a. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=63.04s)]
*  The way you conduct counter-terror operations in the most significant densely populated [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=66.2s)]
*  warfare that we've seen in years is by not only selective operations, but by going into [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=71.6s)]
*  Ra'a. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=77.6s)]
*  The UN units need to clear all those 90-degree angles. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=78.6s)]
*  They need to get barrels inside of rooms. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=81.6s)]
*  They need to get those drones inside. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=83.88s)]
*  That's the nature of unconventional warfare, in this case, special warfare. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=86.28s)]
*  So Blinken is absolutely wrong. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=90.1s)]
*  He's almost lying. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=92.88s)]
*  I feel like this is personal between the White House and whatever relationship they have [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=93.88s)]
*  with Bibi. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=97.69999999999999s)]
*  It's just a bad attempt. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=98.69999999999999s)]
*  And then you get to the information war, Kyron Skinner, because now we know that they have [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=100.52s)]
*  lowered the death toll in Gaza. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=103.82s)]
*  And it says here, UN seemingly halves estimates of Gaza and women children killed on May 6th. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=106.6s)]
*  The UN published data showing that 34,000 plus people reportedly been killed in Gaza, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=111.96s)]
*  including 9,500 women, 14,500 children. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=116.56s)]
*  Two days later, May 8th, the UN published data showing 34,844, including 4,959 women, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=120.22s)]
*  7,000, so half the number of women and half the number of kids. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=128.0s)]
*  We absolutely desperately need accurate information because the information that we have in [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=131.6s)]
*  flames parts of the world, as we have seen. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=136.44s)]
*  And what's so sad about those numbers is that it's a humanitarian organization at the United [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=139.16s)]
*  Nations, not exactly a friend of Washington, that has said the numbers have to be lowered. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=145.3s)]
*  And so it's not even the administration itself. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=152.12s)]
*  It should be our State Department producing evidence that the numbers, that the health [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=154.82s)]
*  ministry in Gaza is in fact wrong. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=160.74s)]
*  And that the health ministry, it's not telling us the truth either. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=166.10000000000002s)]
*  It's controlled by Hamas. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=169.4s)]
*  So the numbers are never right. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=171.22s)]
*  And that puts everything that comes out of Gaza, that Israel has hit a hospital, that [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=172.78s)]
*  Israel has hit a humanitarian truck. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=177.74s)]
*  It puts it all under a suspect way of looking at what's going on. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=180.84s)]
*  If you can't get the information right, you can't get the strategy right. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=187.20000000000002s)]
*  This administration continues to parrot what's coming out of Hamas and of Gaza. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=190.22s)]
*  The New York Times investigation's secret Hamas file show how it spied on everyday Palestinians. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=195.7s)]
*  Goes on to say, quote, the documents show that Hamas leaders, despite claiming to represent [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=200.29999999999998s)]
*  the people of Gaza, would not tolerate even a whiff of dissent. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=204.01999999999998s)]
*  Security officials trailed journalists and people they suspected of immoral behavior. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=207.78s)]
*  Agents got criticism removed from social media and discussed ways to defame political adversaries. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=213.14s)]
*  Political protests were viewed as threats to be undermined. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=219.06s)]
*  This is what you're talking about. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=222.46s)]
*  The same thing that happens in Iran is it is the government against their people. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=223.46s)]
*  And that's what we're seeing in Gaza. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=228.22s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=229.7s)]
*  And Israel is doing the Palestinians a favor by going in there and gutting Hamas trays. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=230.7s)]
*  For every, we have another expression in here, but for every second we waste, another innocent [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=235.46s)]
*  person is going to be killed. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=239.7s)]
*  And the longer the United States wastes to put the hammer on Iran, the longer Israel [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=240.7s)]
*  wastes to put the hammer on Hamas, and finish those last two battalions, the greater the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=244.94s)]
*  risk to the Palestinian people. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=248.57999999999998s)]
*  And to your guest point also, the greater the risk to the domestic threats here in the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=249.94s)]
*  United States that are festering from these idiot kids running around, who have no concept [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=254.22s)]
*  of what's going on, what would happen if they got stuck in the middle of Gaza. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=258.46s)]
*  But the longer the White House waits and placates and panders and with all this nonsense, that [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=261.62s)]
*  rhetoric and incitement is only going to escalate and it's going to fall on the shoulders of [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=266.38s)]
*  law enforcement. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=269.74s)]
*  He talks about the young people, New York Times, a swing state poll, 18 to 29 year olds, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=270.74s)]
*  who do you sympathize with more Israel or Palestinians? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=274.62s)]
*  44% Palestinians, 18 to 29 year olds, you know what's happening across the country [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=277.94s)]
*  is going to last a while. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=283.58s)]
*  Yes, I blame this on K through 16. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=284.58s)]
*  And I've said it before probably on your program, the lack of education in the United States [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=288.06s)]
*  about Israel, about America's role in the world, the good that both have done, both [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=293.82s)]
*  regionally and all over the world, has led our young people to believe that Hamas, which [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=299.46s)]
*  terrorizes its own people and is somehow superior to the United States and to Israel. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=307.22s)]
*  And they really believe it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=314.22s)]
*  And that's exactly right. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=315.34000000000003s)]
*  And they don't understand the degree to which, as your other guest has said, Hamas has terrorized [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=316.34000000000003s)]
*  the Palestinians. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=322.90000000000003s)]
*  And they don't understand how many of the Palestinians have bought into the rhetoric [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=323.90000000000003s)]
*  of Hamas. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=330.06s)]
*  This is a much more complicated story than what's being told on the college campuses [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=331.06s)]
*  and the streets of this country. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=336.24s)]
*  Tyronne Skinner, Aaron Cohen, thank you both. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URbgOTeduEg&t=337.56s)]
