# Hamas is in control of the situation on the ground at this point: Stephen Hadley
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4)
*  Well, President Biden last night calling for a pause in the fighting between Israel and Hamas [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=0.0s)]
*  after he was confronted by a heckler advocating for a ceasefire. This comes as Hamas vows to [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  repeat the terror attacks on Israel until the country is destroyed. Former national security [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=9.92s)]
*  advisor to President George W. Bush, Stephen Hadley joins us now. You keep your finger on the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  pulse of all of this that's happening. Let me start off with the Wall Street Journal editorial [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=19.52s)]
*  board with this headline, How Hamas Defines Ceasefire. Hamas promises more massacres in [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=24.88s)]
*  Arabic while asking for a humanitarian reprieve in English. It knows from experience that some [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=31.04s)]
*  Westerners are gullible enough to fall for it. Do you think the president is asking Israel to back [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=36.48s)]
*  off right now? I don't think so. I think what he look the president I think has been very smart. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=43.599999999999994s)]
*  He's been steadfast in his support for Israel. He made that really unprecedented trip to [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=51.52s)]
*  Israel in the middle of all this crisis. I think that is giving him some standing to counsel with [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=56.96s)]
*  the Israelis about how to conduct their operation in Gaza so that we both most effective but minimize [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=64.24000000000001s)]
*  civilian casualties. There is concern about those innocent Palestinians who are under the thumb [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=70.80000000000001s)]
*  of this crisis who probably don't want Hamas. The question is can there be something that is [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=77.68s)]
*  done to ease the humanitarian crisis of those folks? The Israelis have talked about that. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  There are increased the number of humanitarian trucks that are able to go in with supplies to [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=90.72000000000001s)]
*  Gaza. I think this notion of a pause is just a device to try to facilitate that. The risk, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=95.44000000000001s)]
*  of course, is as you're in the run up to the show suggested, it gives Hamas some time to regroup. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=102.48s)]
*  There are tradeoffs here between getting the job that the Israelis think they need to get done [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=108.80000000000001s)]
*  but showing due consideration for those truly innocent Palestinians who are caught in the middle [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=113.44s)]
*  of this. We are also watching the story that there are apparently 400 Americans who are in Gaza who [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=118.56s)]
*  are trying to get out. Apparently Hamas is going to let them go today. I'm curious about a couple [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=124.72s)]
*  of things. One, do you think that will happen? And two, do we not have more leverage with Qatar, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=129.84s)]
*  for example, to say the Americans will be leaving today? Why does Hamas get to call the shots here? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=136.16s)]
*  Well, unfortunately, Hamas gets to call the shots because Hamas is at this point in control of the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=144.08s)]
*  situation on the ground. The real question is the Egyptians and the Egyptians working out some [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  arrangement with Hamas so that both sides of that exit point can be opened, the sides the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=156.72s)]
*  Egyptians control, the side that Hamas sadly controls, so that those 400 Americans can come [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=162.56s)]
*  out. Hopefully that will happen today. It should have happened two weeks ago. Right. There was also [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=168.8s)]
*  this headline in the New York Times yesterday that raised some eyebrows. After years of vowing to [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=173.68s)]
*  destroy Israel, Iran faces a dilemma. Going on to say with Israel bent on crushing Iran's ally, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=178.32s)]
*  Hamas, Tehran must decide whether it and the proxy militias it arms and trains will live up [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=185.12s)]
*  to its fiery rhetoric. If you think about that in terms of Iran, as well as whatever might happen [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=190.72s)]
*  after the Israelis finish their mission in Gaza, how does that strike you? What kind of dilemma [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=196.96s)]
*  is Iran in? Well, the dilemma I think Iran is in is the fact that the administration has made clear [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=205.36s)]
*  that there will be consequences for Iran if it directly gets into this fight or if it unleashes [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=213.68s)]
*  Hezbollah to attack Israel from the north out of their sanctuary in southern Lebanon. That was the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=220.72s)]
*  right thing to do by the administration. Hopefully it will give Iran pause so that this conflict does [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=226.72s)]
*  not spread and become a multi-front war for Israel. And Israel then is given the time to deal with [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=234.0s)]
*  the problem of Hamas in Gaza. How much time, what do you think Israel needs to do to be thinking [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=240.16s)]
*  about as they're calling it, sort of the day after? Well, I think that's the question. How much [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=246.4s)]
*  damage can Israel do to Hamas? If it really can break its hold on Gaza, what kind of structure [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=253.68s)]
*  comes into place in order to replace the Hamas administration of Gaza? I don't think the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=262.56s)]
*  Palestinian Authority have what it takes. I don't think the Arab countries are going to come in. I [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=268.08s)]
*  don't think Israel wants to reoccupy Gaza. So I think one of the things that Americans and Israelis [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=272.88s)]
*  are beginning to think about is the day after. And I think that'll be driven a lot by how this ends, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=278.71999999999997s)]
*  how the operation in Gaza winds down, what the situation is like at that point, and what [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=284.88s)]
*  conclusions the people of Israel draw from this. Is it that really they're done with the Palestinians [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=290.88s)]
*  and the support for annexation on the West Bank goes up? Or do people [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=297.6s)]
*  conclude that you can't have peace with the Arab world without doing something for the Palestinians? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=302.24s)]
*  And so the issue of two-state solutions comes back on the agenda. So it'll be interesting to see what [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  the people of Israel conclude after this terrible experience that they're going through now. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=313.28000000000003s)]
*  Steve Hadley, thank you for coming on the show today. We'll stay in touch with you. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClgFscDSh4&t=318.88s)]
