# This is ‘absolutely inappropriate’ from the Biden admin: GOP senator
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI)
*  And for more on this we're joined now by Republican Senator from Iowa and member [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=0.0s)]
*  of the Senate Armed Services Committee Joni Ernst. She's also chair of the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Republican Policy Committee coming to us from Simi Valley there at the Reagan [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=8.76s)]
*  Defense Forum. Senator, thank you for taking time as we know we are hearing [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=13.74s)]
*  that a lot of the attendees there talking about what is perceived in their [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=19.72s)]
*  latest survey to be the top threat of China. But before we get to that let me [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=24.12s)]
*  just pick up where Lucas Tomlinson at the White House was talking about and [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=28.96s)]
*  then Greg Palcate in Israel. The situation now in Gaza, IDF going back in [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=33.32s)]
*  going in in the south. Are you concerned that this administration is putting [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=39.52s)]
*  restrictions that is holding back Israel in the IDF from doing what they need to [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=46.16s)]
*  do to eradicate Hamas? Griff, we should not be telling the IDF how they should [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=52.88s)]
*  run their campaigns any more than we would expect to have Israel tell the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=59.480000000000004s)]
*  United States how we should run ours. So I think it's absolutely inappropriate [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=64.36s)]
*  for us to tell them how to win this war against Hamas. What we do know, Hamas [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=69.08s)]
*  is the ones they perpetrated these crimes against innocent Israelis. They [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=75.44s)]
*  must be wiped off the face of the planet. The IDF will do that. I also held [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=80.6s)]
*  a bipartisan briefing this past week with the IDF general and spokesman from [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  Israel and they were able to clearly outline to both Democrats and [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=92.11999999999999s)]
*  Republicans in the Senate the extraordinary efforts the IDF goes to [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=96.6s)]
*  in order to prevent innocent civilian casualties in Gaza. We also heard from [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=102.08s)]
*  members of Central Command and it was good to have those briefings so that [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=108.8s)]
*  our representatives in Congress understand what truly is going on on the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=113.52s)]
*  ground in Israel in Gaza. So Griff, absolutely we should not be telling the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=119.32s)]
*  idea of how they are going to win this war or what what restriction should be [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=125.24s)]
*  placed upon them. Let's talk a little bit about what's happening there in [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=131.76s)]
*  Simi Valley where you are and this was really an interesting survey results [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=135.44s)]
*  that 74% of the respondents asked in the Reagan National Defense Survey, how [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=141.8s)]
*  concerned are you about the next threat in the next five years? And China was top [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=148.84s)]
*  of mind. Three out of four Americans worried about China as the top threat. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=154.92s)]
*  Why is that when we've got a hot war in Israel, a hot war in Ukraine, we've got [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  Iran proxies attacking US personnel all across the Middle East? Griff we see [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=165.84s)]
*  China absolutely everywhere and it's not just kinetically through military [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=172.72s)]
*  actions, we see them invading in our economic space as well. We see them [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=179.01999999999998s)]
*  moving into South America, Central America. We see them in Europe. We see [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=184.48s)]
*  them in Africa. They are moving around the world literally. We see them in Iowa. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=191.0s)]
*  So Iowans may not think about the South China Sea every single day, but what they [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=198.04s)]
*  do see, they see the theft of intellectual property when Chinese [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=203.23999999999998s)]
*  nationals come into our state and steal seed technology for corn, for soybeans. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=207.48s)]
*  So China, because of the inherently bad actions that they take around the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=215.12s)]
*  globe, Americans notice that whether it's through the military or other means. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=221.83999999999997s)]
*  So this is concerning and it shows. It's so fascinating that you're [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=226.51999999999998s)]
*  pointing that out Senator because one part of this survey that really took me [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=231.76s)]
*  by surprise was 75 percent, full-on three out of four Americans felt that [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=237.24s)]
*  China will surpass the US as the world's superpower. Let me ask you, are you [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=244.0s)]
*  concerned? Are we going to see either next year in five years in our lifetimes [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=251.32000000000002s)]
*  see China surpass the US as the world's top superpower? Well Griff we need to [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=256.88s)]
*  invest heavily in technology in the United States and we can do that by [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=263.0s)]
*  leveraging some taxpayer dollars with a lot of private investment and and we can [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=269.36s)]
*  do that and I was just on a panel here at the Reagan National Defense Forum [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=275.24s)]
*  with Dr. Alex Karp of Palantir. They are leaders in the artificial intelligence [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=279.76s)]
*  space. He does a lot of defense work. He was very optimistic and I loved his [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=285.72s)]
*  message. He believes that as Americans we are going to overcome. We will [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=290.84s)]
*  continue to lead in this. He will be on this program a little later in the hour [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=296.03999999999996s)]
*  with Jen Griffin there. Let me ask you before I run out of time, I've got about [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  30 seconds. Your fellow Senator Rand Paul saved your life using the Heimlich [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=303.88s)]
*  maneuver. What happened? Yes, oh my goodness I took a bite of steak sandwich [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=309.5s)]
*  and nothing against our cattlemen but choked on on that bite of food and [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=315.8s)]
*  Senator Rand Paul came right to the rescue. He knew immediately what to do [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=320.96000000000004s)]
*  and very grateful to Rand Paul. Thanks so much. Actually I was choking on those [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=325.76s)]
*  woke policies the Democrats are shoving down my throat but but truly thanks to [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=330.88s)]
*  Rand Paul for his quick actions. Sometimes it helps to have a doctor in [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=336.40000000000003s)]
*  Congress. Senator Joni Ernst live for us from Simi Valley. Thank you for your time and have a [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=341.08s)]
*  great continued weekend there in California. You're bad. Thanks, Griff. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfnewoT3nI&t=346.44s)]
