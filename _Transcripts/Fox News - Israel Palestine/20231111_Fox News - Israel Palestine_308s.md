# Israel expert issues warning on imminent challenge in the war
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU)
*  So for more on the latest from Israel, joining me live from Tel Aviv is a member of the Israeli [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=0.0s)]
*  parliament and former ambassador to the UN, Danny Danan. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=5.0s)]
*  Danny, thank you again for joining us. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=8.08s)]
*  Good to see you as always. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=10.08s)]
*  I want to start off with what's happening in the region right now, this huge Arab-Muslim [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=11.52s)]
*  summit taking place in Riyadh, where you have many, many different leaders, including Iran. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=17.8s)]
*  Iran is there calling for a ceasefire. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=23.52s)]
*  So I'll get your reaction to that first. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=26.64s)]
*  Well, first, I shall not only calling for a ceasefire. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=30.04s)]
*  We heard very carefully the words of the Iranian leader who called for the eradication of Israel [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=33.8s)]
*  completely. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=40.4s)]
*  So we know that Iran is spreading violence in the region. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=41.64s)]
*  They are trying to get on board the more moderate Arab countries. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=45.68s)]
*  Not successfully so far. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=49.36s)]
*  They know that we are fighting evil and already the issue of humanitarian aspects. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=51.2s)]
*  But you know, deep inside they know that we are fighting Hamas, we are fighting evil. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=56.839999999999996s)]
*  And Hamas and those radical ideas, they put a threat also for the moderate regime in the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=61.48s)]
*  Middle East, not only for us. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  Ambassador, you know, it was just about 40 days ago that Fox News or Bret Baer sat down [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=68.24s)]
*  with MBS and they were talking about normalizing relations with Israel. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=73.24s)]
*  Here is MBS just this weekend on his views about Israel. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  The kingdom assures its absolute rejection of the continuation of the Israeli aggression, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=84.32s)]
*  the occupation and the forcible displacement of the residents of Gaza. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  And it confirms it is holding the occupation authorities accountable for the crimes against [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=93.96s)]
*  the Palestinian people. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=98.83999999999999s)]
*  So he says the crimes against the Palestinian people. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=100.91999999999999s)]
*  These are pretty strong words coming from the Crown Prince. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=104.32s)]
*  Let me ask you this, Ambassador. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=107.52s)]
*  Is Israel worried at all that by the actions it's taking in Gaza to protect its own citizens, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=109.92s)]
*  that this might lose the progress that it's made in the last decade with the regional [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=118.36s)]
*  partners, the Arab partners like Saudi Arabia, in trying to normalize these relations? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=124.6s)]
*  Are you worried about that? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=128.84s)]
*  Well, I'm still optimistic about the Arab Accord. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=130.32s)]
*  We can speak about expanding the accord. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=135.56s)]
*  But I agree with you, Aisha. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=138.96s)]
*  You know, we saw the interview with Fox News over MBS and we know that the Iranians were [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=139.96s)]
*  not happy about it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=145.44s)]
*  And look what's happening today. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=146.44s)]
*  All of a sudden there's a handshake between the Iranian leaders and the Saudis. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=147.44s)]
*  And they were able, unfortunately, they were able to delay the agreement between Israel [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=153.64000000000001s)]
*  and the Saudis. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=158.8s)]
*  They were able to drag us to a cycle of violence. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=159.8s)]
*  And many people asked why it happened on October 7th. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=162.68s)]
*  What was the reason for this unprovoked attack? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=166.08s)]
*  I think one of the reasons was the desire of Iran to block the progress between the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=168.72s)]
*  U.S., Israel and the Saudis. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=173.28s)]
*  But eventually it will happen. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=175.28s)]
*  Yeah, I think we actually have video of, you know, the diplomat from Iran arriving in Saudi [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=177.28s)]
*  Arabia, if we can play that for our viewers right now. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=182.76000000000002s)]
*  I mean, when you look at images like that and what's happening right now in Riyadh, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=184.88s)]
*  Is Israel able to trust these regional partners in the future to normalize relations? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=190.96s)]
*  So we still have an open dialogue with our partners in the region, but now we are focused [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=199.08s)]
*  in a war. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=203.60000000000002s)]
*  We are fighting Hamas. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=204.60000000000002s)]
*  We are determined to win this war. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=205.60000000000002s)]
*  We know it's not easy for our allies also in the region, but we have no other choice. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=207.68s)]
*  You know, we were not the one who started the war on October 7th. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=212.92000000000002s)]
*  And we were the one where our families were abducted. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=216.56s)]
*  You know, we have 240 people now still in the hands of Hamas, including babies. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=220.06s)]
*  You know, I saw all the demonstrations in New York City that took place. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=224.78s)]
*  I haven't seen even one sign about the Israeli hostages, about the 30 babies in the hands [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=228.38s)]
*  of Hamas. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=233.10000000000002s)]
*  So we are focused on bringing our boys and babies back home, defeating Hamas. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=234.10000000000002s)]
*  After that, I have no doubt that we will continue to walk to achieve peace and to build the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=238.98000000000002s)]
*  strong ties we have with the neighbors. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=245.18s)]
*  Ambassador, we just have about 20 seconds left. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=247.42000000000002s)]
*  Can you give us an update on the timeline? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=250.01999999999998s)]
*  We heard from the president. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=252.1s)]
*  We heard from Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=253.29999999999998s)]
*  They both agree it's taking a lot longer than they anticipated, ridding Hamas from Gaza. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=255.32s)]
*  Where are we at? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=262.09999999999997s)]
*  How much of Hamas have you destroyed so far? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=263.09999999999997s)]
*  And who are you looking for? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=265.42s)]
*  So we have a challenge here, because if we move slow, we are able to minimize casualties [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=267.26s)]
*  to our troops and to the civilians. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=275.46s)]
*  If we move faster, the casualties will be higher. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=277.86s)]
*  So I think we should move to take the time we need to minimize casualties. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=280.78000000000003s)]
*  And we have the time. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=284.94s)]
*  With all the respect to all the demonstrations, we have the time. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=286.74s)]
*  We are fighting for our lives and we will win. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=290.06s)]
*  Okay, Ambassador Danny Danan, thank you for joining us live from Tel Aviv. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=292.82s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxSDlDUNSU&t=297.1s)]
