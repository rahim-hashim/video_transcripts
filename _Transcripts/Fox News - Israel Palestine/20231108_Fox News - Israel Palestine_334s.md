# Ex-Israeli leader condemns pro-Palestinian protests in the West
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4)
*  Thousands have taken to the streets, echoing Tlaib's hateful, virulent, anti-Semitic [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=0.0s)]
*  rhetoric. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=5.66s)]
*  And sadly, these rabid anti-Israel riots are getting worse, and so are the chants from [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=6.66s)]
*  the protesters. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=11.26s)]
*  Take a look at what they were screaming outside of Joe Biden's White House this weekend. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=12.26s)]
*  Allahu akbar. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=29.82s)]
*  Sound familiar? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=31.02s)]
*  Yeah, those were words echoed by some of the pilots on 9-11-01 as they killed 2,977 Americans. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=32.02s)]
*  Here now with reaction the former prime minister of Israel, Naftali Bennett is with us. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=40.660000000000004s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, good to see you. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=45.7s)]
*  For the life of me, I do not understand the United States of America. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=48.94s)]
*  Israel stood strong with America post-9-11. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=55.1s)]
*  You guys never wavered, ever. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=58.58s)]
*  And here, this is the worst terror attack in Israeli history. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=61.14s)]
*  And we have an American president and administration pressuring Israel to put a pause on defending [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=65.28s)]
*  your homeland, defending your country? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=72.06s)]
*  Has that been happening? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=74.58s)]
*  Well, I want to explain, Sean, the meaning of pause in the war. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=75.58s)]
*  Right now, we've embarked on an inevitable war to eliminate Hamas. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=82.06s)]
*  There's no way that we can accept a terror state that did what it did on our border. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=87.62s)]
*  The moment we paused in the middle of the war, it gives time for our enemies to replenish [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=94.18s)]
*  themselves, to rearm, to freshen up. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=100.1s)]
*  And in effect, it lengthens the war. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=103.38s)]
*  Every day of pause is another two weeks of war, which means many more dead people on [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=106.3s)]
*  both sides. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=112.34s)]
*  It would be tantamount to, say, January of 1945, that the allies would tell Germany, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=113.82000000000001s)]
*  you know what, we're going to pause the war for a few days, take your time, we don't [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=121.42s)]
*  want to hurt civilians. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=125.22s)]
*  And the war would have continued into 1946, 1947. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=126.94s)]
*  The best way to save lives is to accelerate the war, beat Hamas, and this whole nightmare [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=131.06s)]
*  will be over. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=138.38s)]
*  Let me ask you, Mr. Prime Minister, and this is important to me. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=140.1s)]
*  Doesn't the net result have to be the elimination of not only Hamas but Hezbollah and Lebanon? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=144.62s)]
*  Doesn't the net result have to be that neither Lebanon nor Gaza can no longer be launching [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=150.82s)]
*  areas for the hundreds of thousands of rockets? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=156.0s)]
*  I've been there when they've been fired. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=158.7s)]
*  I've been in the terror tunnels. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=160.98000000000002s)]
*  Doesn't this have to end with those areas no longer being a launching pad to attack [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=163.26s)]
*  Israel with those rockets? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=167.66s)]
*  Doesn't that have to come to an end? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=169.7s)]
*  Doesn't it alsoâ€”don't you have to destroy all of this network of terror tunnels? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=171.5s)]
*  I've been in them. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=176.7s)]
*  Doesn't that have to be part of the equation, too? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=178.01999999999998s)]
*  And at some point, doesn't somebody need to deal with the head of the snake and that [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=181.38s)]
*  being Iran, that is orchestrating all of this with their proxy wars? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=185.57999999999998s)]
*  I think you're absolutely right. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=191.14s)]
*  We have an octopus of terror. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=192.98s)]
*  and the arms are Hezbollah, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and terror cells around the world. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=196.1s)]
*  And those who are fueling it are sitting in Tehran, and they feel immune. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=202.66s)]
*  What we need to do is ultimately hit Tehran as prime minister. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=207.7s)]
*  When I was prime minister of Israel, according to foreign sources, when they messed around [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=213.14s)]
*  with Israel, there were commanders of al-Quds terror units that were assassinated in the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=218.34s)]
*  heart of Tehran. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=225.14000000000001s)]
*  There was a drone base in Iran that was bombed. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=227.14000000000001s)]
*  And that's what we need to do, because fighting just the arms of the octopus doesn't really [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=231.1s)]
*  make sense. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=237.7s)]
*  And you're right on that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=238.7s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, I only have about 30 seconds left. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=239.7s)]
*  We have seen, you know, from the river to the sea, we've heard that. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=242.14000000000001s)]
*  I never thought I'd hear the words, gas the Jews, F the Jews, and all this virulent anti-Semitic [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=247.5s)]
*  rhetoric in the United States, on college campuses, in the halls of Congress, and worldwide. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=254.54s)]
*  I've never been one to use Nazi analogies, but this sounds eerily like the 1930s to me [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=260.5s)]
*  and all that I've learned in history. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=267.82s)]
*  I had no idea that this level of hatred existed. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=269.82s)]
*  What is your reaction to it in the 30 seconds we have? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=274.02s)]
*  Sean, me neither. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=277.54s)]
*  I never imagined that on the ground of the United States of America we'd hear people [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=279.26s)]
*  chant, effectively, kill the Jews, because that's what from the river to the sea means, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=283.78000000000003s)]
*  because that's where the state of Israel is. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=290.3s)]
*  But there is a response. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=292.92s)]
*  There is one way to do away with all this anti-Semitism in America and our war with [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=293.92s)]
*  Hamas, and that's total victory on Hamas. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=299.5s)]
*  Defeat them, hit them, kill the terrorists, and by doing that, this whole thing will change. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=304.62s)]
*  All right, Mr. Prime Minister, our prayers are with Israel and the people of Israel tonight [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=310.98s)]
*  in where prayer is for victory, not for applause, for full victory. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=316.1s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVeag-mcN4&t=321.66s)]
