*  aid going into Gaza. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjwoUwXZ2rA&t=13.32s)]
*  Trey Yanks live for us on the ground in southern Israel with the very latest. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjwoUwXZ2rA&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  Trey? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjwoUwXZ2rA&t=18.12s)]
*  Hey Todd, good morning. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjwoUwXZ2rA&t=19.12s)]
*  It's day 67 of the war between Israel and Hamas. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjwoUwXZ2rA&t=21.8s)]
*  overnight Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Galan providing an update about the situation [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjwoUwXZ2rA&t=25.6s)]

*  They've also made more arrests of Hamas fighters amid fierce battles for territory. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjwoUwXZ2rA&t=37.56s)]
*  They do hope to gather new intelligence from them. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjwoUwXZ2rA&t=41.74s)]
*  Galan going on to lay out the goals for Israeli troops. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjwoUwXZ2rA&t=44.0s)]
*  Israel will take any measures in order to destroy Hamas. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjwoUwXZ2rA&t=47.72s)]
*  But we have no intention to stay permanently in Gaza Strip. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjwoUwXZ2rA&t=53.16s)]
*  We only take care of our security and the security of our citizens alongside the borders [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjwoUwXZ2rA&t=58.68s)]
*  with Gaza and elsewhere. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjwoUwXZ2rA&t=64.6s)]

*  The Kerem Shalom crossing was historically used for goods to enter Gaza from Israel. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjwoUwXZ2rA&t=77.28s)]
*  Now it will be used to screen aid trucks entering the enclave. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjwoUwXZ2rA&t=81.68s)]
*  Those trucks will still have to cross through Egypt though so today's announcement only [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjwoUwXZ2rA&t=84.76s)]
*  affects the screening process. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjwoUwXZ2rA&t=88.26s)]

*  the northern front. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjwoUwXZ2rA&t=101.16000000000001s)]
*  New sirens sounding today amid rocket fire from the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjwoUwXZ2rA&t=102.16000000000001s)]
