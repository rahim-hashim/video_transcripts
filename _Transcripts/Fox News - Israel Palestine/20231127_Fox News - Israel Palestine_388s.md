# ‘Baby be-headers’ are not morally the same as Israeli babies: Government spokesman
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0)
*  Joining me now with an update on the release of the latest round of hostages and their [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=0.0s)]
*  condition, Israeli government spokesman Avi Hyman. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=4.4s)]
*  Avi, just let's start with the condition. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=7.28s)]
*  Of course, seven weeks of captivity, mostly in dark tunnels. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=9.92s)]
*  I've read and heard where many have lost a tremendous amount of weight. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=14.48s)]
*  Give us an update on the conditions. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=19.04s)]
*  Charles, thank you very much for having me on and thank you for your continued support. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=21.44s)]
*  We are checking their conditions. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=28.32s)]
*  It's an unfolding story. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=29.82s)]
*  They only were released in the last four days. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=30.98s)]
*  So I mean, I can tell you one, an 85 year old, 85 year old was released yesterday and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=33.94s)]
*  went straight into, was flown straight to the hospital to go into intensive care. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=41.06s)]
*  She's in a serious, in a serious way and we pray for her speedy recovery. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=46.78s)]
*  But the scenes that we're seeing are bittersweet. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=51.78s)]
*  The mood in Israel is bittersweet. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=54.66s)]
*  On the one hand, we're seeing masked monsters bringing out hostages. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=56.52s)]
*  We're happy to see those hostages, but still so many are left behind. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=62.56s)]
*  And at the same time, we shouldn't have to see images of three year old twin girls being [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=65.88s)]
*  brought in by masked Hamas terrorists. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  Three year old twins shouldn't be taken hostage. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=76.32000000000001s)]
*  Nine month old babies shouldn't be taken hostage. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=78.98s)]
*  This is absurd. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=81.80000000000001s)]
*  It is absurd. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=83.08000000000001s)]
*  It needs to end. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=84.08000000000001s)]
*  It's amazing to me that we have rules for war, right? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=85.24s)]
*  The Geneva Accords and this sort of, this is beyond the pale from the very beginning, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=87.92s)]
*  from the invasion, from the barbaristic invasion to what we're seeing. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=93.0s)]
*  Eighty year olds kept in captivity, malnutrition, three year old twins. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=98.32s)]
*  And yet, you know, we just, here in America, we've been shocked, shocked at the public [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=103.48s)]
*  relations aspect of this. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=109.24s)]
*  And I'm sure in Israel as well about the messaging of all of this that makes Hamas [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=110.68s)]
*  somehow the victims in all of this. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=115.64s)]
*  Yeah, there's a real problem in the world today of moral relativism. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=119.88000000000001s)]
*  When people are putting the baby beheaders on the same plane as those pure innocent babies, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=124.28s)]
*  we saw these terrorists storm through our borders, kill children in front of their parents, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=131.8s)]
*  in front of their children. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=137.88s)]
*  Again, behead babies, burn whole families alive. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=139.16s)]
*  This conflict is as black and white as the ISIS flags that we found on some of those [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=143.16s)]
*  terrorists. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=148.2s)]
*  And it's a time now more than ever where we call on people to have moral clarity and stand [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=149.2s)]
*  with Israel in this time of need. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=154.2s)]
*  One of the debates that's growing is that it's an ideology and it's hard to destroy [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=156.2s)]
*  an ideology. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=162.4s)]
*  Although some are saying if you look back to Germany, if you look back to Hitler, if [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=163.76s)]
*  you look back to the Nazism, once you killed the leadership, the ideology faded away. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=167.92s)]
*  Well, it's more than leadership. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it's the organization itself. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  And that is exactly it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=180.35999999999999s)]
*  I mean, who would have thought that Germany and Japan would be among America's closest [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=181.35999999999999s)]
*  allies at that time? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=187.84s)]
*  We will plow on with our mission, which is to totally destroy Hamas, to ensure that they [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=190.72s)]
*  cannot rule over Gaza, that they are part of history, free Gaza from Hamas, and of course, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=196.60000000000002s)]
*  to free those 240 hostages. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=204.18s)]
*  No one can be left behind. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=206.68s)]
*  How concerned are you, Avi, that the extension of this truce now, apparently two days, there's [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=209.32000000000002s)]
*  a lot to be said about momentum in every aspect of life, but particularly in war and warcraft. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  Allows Hamas to regroup to a certain extent and maybe create more havoc. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=222.24s)]
*  So it's about calculated risk. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=227.68s)]
*  We know that we wouldn't be where we are today. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=230.04s)]
*  We wouldn't have just received 50 hostages had Hamas not been on their knees begging, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=232.6s)]
*  please stop. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=238.52s)]
*  We hit them so, so hard. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=240.6s)]
*  We took out so many of their leaders. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=242.46s)]
*  We created serious pain for Hamas. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=245.72s)]
*  So they were begging us to stop. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=248.58s)]
*  And that's how we got these hostages out. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=250.94s)]
*  And we will continue that pressure. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=253.48s)]
*  We will do the humanitarian pause for as long as we think it makes sense to get as many [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=256.24s)]
*  hostages out as we can. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=260.88s)]
*  And then we'll plow through with the mission. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=263.92s)]
*  And I can tell you from speaking to soldiers on the ground, they are ready. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=266.64s)]
*  They do not want to come home until Hamas is part of history because never again can [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=271.02s)]
*  we allow these barbarians to plow through our borders and do what they did on October [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=276.03999999999996s)]
*  7th. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=280.09999999999997s)]
*  And they have made it very clear publicly that they seek to do it again, again and again. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=281.09999999999997s)]
*  So the people are with us, the people are with the army. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=287.71999999999997s)]
*  We will destroy Hamas. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=290.79999999999995s)]
*  So Avi, how do you determine when you've destroyed Hamas? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=292.46s)]
*  How do you pick out members of Hamas versus just Palestinians who in some degree may also [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=298.76s)]
*  have the same objective? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=305.28000000000003s)]
*  We need a situation by which Hamas is no longer in control of Gaza. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=309.0s)]
*  Hamas can no longer keep our people hostage or keep their own people hostage. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=314.22s)]
*  The day after Hamas, we'll see three things. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=319.8s)]
*  We'll see the Gaza Strip is demilitarized. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=323.12s)]
*  The Gaza Strip is de-radicalized. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=326.56s)]
*  And Gaza will have to be rebuilt in a very different way. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=329.26s)]
*  Israel will have to control the security aspects. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=333.7s)]
*  And there'll be a new type of civilian leadership there, a new type of civilian leadership that [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=337.58s)]
*  doesn't teach their children to hate Jews from age zero, that doesn't teach their children [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=341.22s)]
*  that one day they will take over the state of Israel from the river to the sea and it [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=346.94s)]
*  will be Jew free. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=351.98s)]
*  Like you said, there is a historical precedent, what happened in Germany, what happened in [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=354.52000000000004s)]
*  Japan, where we hope for a better future for both our children and their children. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=359.92s)]
*  Avi, thank you for taking the time out. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=364.84000000000003s)]
*  All the best. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=368.28000000000003s)]
*  We'll certainly reach out to you again real soon. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=369.28000000000003s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=370.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qymN0CGqpC0&t=371.92s)]
