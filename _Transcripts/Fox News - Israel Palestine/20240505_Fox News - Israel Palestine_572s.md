# 'TOTAL CHAOS': Everything in America is in chaos says, Sen. Rubio
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [May 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4)
*  Joining us now, GOP Senator Marco Rubio, ranking member of the Senate Intel Committee. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome back to Fox News Sunday. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=4.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=6.96s)]
*  Okay, so let's start there. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=7.96s)]
*  It sounds like this hostage negotiation deal is falling apart. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=9.24s)]
*  Secretary Blinken said Hamas just needs to say yes, and not only does it not sound like [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=13.92s)]
*  they're saying yes, they've got this shelling this morning at an aid crossing that is going [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=17.2s)]
*  to shut it down. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=22.22s)]
*  You have been there in recent days with the prime minister. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=23.22s)]
*  They say they're moving in on RAFA. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=26.16s)]
*  Where do we go from here? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=27.84s)]
*  Well, it's their war and they have a right to fight it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=28.84s)]
*  These are degenerate savages. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=32.48s)]
*  Hamas, I mean, just think about the report that I just heard a second ago, okay? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=33.84s)]
*  Everybody's saying send in humanitarian aid. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=38.08s)]
*  These poor people are starving. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=39.7s)]
*  Well, that's what they tried to do. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=40.7s)]
*  And these guys are launching mortar attacks against the humanitarian aid that's coming [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=42.68s)]
*  in. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=47.24s)]
*  You know that a lot of the humanitarian aid that's getting in, and Israel's allowing [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=48.24s)]
*  it in anyways because they know they need to do it, but Hamas, this stuff's being sold [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  in the marketplace. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=54.16s)]
*  This administration, this is Israel's war. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  We should basically say we are on the side of the people who were the victims on October [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=57.4s)]
*  7th of a bunch of savages and lunatics who came across that border and massacred and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=61.76s)]
*  killed and kidnapped and raped and took hostages back with them. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=67.16s)]
*  These people need to be defeated. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=70.32s)]
*  How is Israel supposed to coexist, to live side by side alongside, next to these people? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=71.8s)]
*  And when they talk about displaced people, there are 80,000 Israelis right now that are [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=77.53999999999999s)]
*  displaced from the north. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=81.44s)]
*  They have to live. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=83.25999999999999s)]
*  I saw them. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=84.25999999999999s)]
*  They are living in hotels. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=85.25999999999999s)]
*  They are going to school online and conference rooms at hotels. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=86.26s)]
*  They can't go north because Hezbollah is attacking them in northern Israel. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=89.06s)]
*  So this is a time where we need to have not a weak and feeble president, but someone who [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  makes it very clear that we are on Israel's side. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=96.54s)]
*  They are the good guys in this fight, and Hamas are the evil ones. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=99.28s)]
*  And these terrible civilian casualties that are happening is because Hamas is using them [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=102.66s)]
*  as human shields. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=106.74000000000001s)]
*  Well, and I think that a lot of people, as we watch these campus protests and demonstrations [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=107.74000000000001s)]
*  that have spread, would agree that nobody wants civilians to be killed in this process. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=113.94s)]
*  But in many of those cases, clearly they have crossed the line to actually threatening fellow [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=116.82s)]
*  students, those kinds of things. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=120.89999999999999s)]
*  We're hearing now from some international students who are speaking up saying they worry [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=121.9s)]
*  that because they may be suspended or disciplined, it could cost them their student visa to be [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=125.7s)]
*  here in the U.S. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=130.34s)]
*  Do you think that's going too far? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=131.86s)]
*  Do you think that's an appropriate response? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=132.86s)]
*  I think Joe Biden, or he hasn't done it again because he's weak and he's feeble. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=136.74s)]
*  But Joe Biden, very early on, should have said, as I asked him to do back in October, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=141.54s)]
*  if you're in the streets of the United States, you're here as a visitor on a visa. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=145.22s)]
*  OK, you're not American. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=148.3s)]
*  You're here on a visa and you're here to teach or you're here to go to school. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=149.62s)]
*  And you're out there chanting on behalf of Hamas and Hezbollah and these terrorist groups, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=153.22s)]
*  who by the way, also hate America. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=157.1s)]
*  We should revoke your visa. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=158.9s)]
*  If you are here in this country as a visitor on a visa and you are defacing statues in [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=160.28s)]
*  George Washington, ripping down American flags, putting up Palestinian flags, you should have [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=164.64s)]
*  your visa revoked and eliminated. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=169.32s)]
*  And he should have been very clear about whose side we're on from the very beginning. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=172.42000000000002s)]
*  But look, there's a bunch of Democratic donors, major Democratic donors, who are behind the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=175.3s)]
*  groups that are funding all this. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=179.70000000000002s)]
*  I saw the other day, I think it was in UCLA, there's thousands of dollars of plywood that [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=181.3s)]
*  they were using as barricades against the police. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=185.82s)]
*  They're committing acts of violence, not just acts of anti-Semitism, acts of violence, of [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=188.26000000000002s)]
*  vandalism, threatening people. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=192.34s)]
*  I saw another video of a Jewish student who had to get police, had to basically shame [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=194.14000000000001s)]
*  the police into escorting him so that he could go into an area of the university where he [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=199.7s)]
*  had every right to be because of these zombies, these anti-Semitic left-wing nutcases that [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=205.18s)]
*  the president should have been very firm about. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=211.3s)]
*  And that's why everything in America is in chaos, from our border to our campuses, total [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=213.3s)]
*  chaos because we have a weak and we have a feeble president who cannot communicate and [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=217.18s)]
*  refuses to take a strong line on this because he's afraid of people voting against him in [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=221.84s)]
*  November who support these crazy ideas. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=226.38s)]
*  Well, do you give him some credit for the speech this week? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=228.29999999999998s)]
*  He clearly denounced what has crossed the line, saying, listen, we've got to have free [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=230.29999999999998s)]
*  speech protections. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=233.89999999999998s)]
*  We have a First Amendment. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=235.1s)]
*  He did come out and make stronger remarks than that. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=236.89999999999998s)]
*  But at the same time, we haven't seen that we know of action by the DOJ. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=239.54s)]
*  Are you surprised there aren't some civil rights investigations? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=243.29999999999998s)]
*  Maybe they've been launched, but certainly not publicly. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=245.85999999999999s)]
*  Well, he gave a short speech off of note cards seven days into this crisis. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=247.77999999999997s)]
*  We should have heard from him from the very beginning. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=254.33999999999997s)]
*  But these are students from all over the country. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=256.18s)]
*  Think about this, the people who you know, who's not getting any coverage right now, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=258.02s)]
*  the kids who paid eighty thousand dollars a year to go to these universities, who can't [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=261.02s)]
*  take finals, can't use the library, can't go to class, many of whom have dropped out [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=265.3s)]
*  of school. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=270.5s)]
*  Who's fighting for them? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=271.7s)]
*  Joe Biden should have spoken about them very early in this process. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=273.02s)]
*  His failure to address this early on and to make very clear whose side he was on has just [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=276.06s)]
*  fed this, has just increased this. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=280.78s)]
*  He should have been very clear and defined himself early on about this. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=283.46000000000004s)]
*  And they're not doing anything about it as far as I can see. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=286.46000000000004s)]
*  I mean, where are the I want to see if they put as much resource and time into investigating [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=288.90000000000003s)]
*  these people as they've investigated other people in the last couple of years. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=293.7s)]
*  Well, we know the Department of Education has launched some investigations. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=297.14000000000004s)]
*  We'll talk about that a little bit later in the show. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=300.62s)]
*  But I want to get to a couple of other domestic issues with you. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=302.18s)]
*  The issue of abortion has been a very difficult one for Republicans. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=305.26s)]
*  You seem to be of the mindset that you need to embrace it and try to control the conversation [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=308.34000000000003s)]
*  in a better way and actually talk about it, not run from it. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=312.98s)]
*  Democrats, though, feel like it's a it's a great case to make against you. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=316.3s)]
*  Here's the vice president in Florida days ago when the six week ban in Florida went [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=320.26s)]
*  into effect. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=325.06s)]
*  Since Roe was overturned, every time reproductive freedom has been on the ballot, the people [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=327.1s)]
*  of America voted for freedom. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=335.02000000000004s)]
*  Now, the Florida Supreme Court has said an abortion measure can be on the Florida ballot [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=340.26s)]
*  there in November. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=343.78000000000003s)]
*  How worried are you about that motivating the base? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=345.3s)]
*  Well, what I'm more worried about is that no one ever asked the vice president, Kamala [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=347.98s)]
*  Harris or any Democrat what restrictions do they support? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=352.66s)]
*  Which abortion should not be allowed? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=356.5s)]
*  They never tell you should someone be allowed to do an abortion on the day of birth, after [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=358.34000000000003s)]
*  birth, nine months should should pass the point of viability. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=363.02s)]
*  They will never tell you which abortions should not be allowed. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=367.78000000000003s)]
*  OK, they're always demanding to know what exceptions do you support, but they never [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=370.62s)]
*  tell you which restrictions they would support. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=374.26s)]
*  They are extremists. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=376.62s)]
*  They believe abortion should be allowed at any time for any reason, basically, and paid [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=377.86s)]
*  for by taxpayers. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=382.22s)]
*  No one ever asked Kamala Harris that no one ever asked the Democrats that. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=383.54s)]
*  So they should they should be someone should start asking them what their position is on [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=387.1s)]
*  that. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=391.1s)]
*  And then we can sort of define and decide, all right, what are the policy options here? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=392.1s)]
*  I don't I've never viewed abortion as a political issue. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=395.5s)]
*  I know I believe it is a moral issue. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=398.53999999999996s)]
*  It is the conflict between two rights, a woman's right to choose and an unborn human being's [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=400.41999999999996s)]
*  right to live. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=404.65999999999997s)]
*  And I err on the side of life because without life, none of the other rights matter. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=405.65999999999997s)]
*  There's no right to speech. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=409.21999999999997s)]
*  There's no right to vote. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=410.58s)]
*  There's no right to do anything if you're not alive. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=411.82s)]
*  And we have to have laws that define how we protect human life. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=413.85999999999996s)]
*  But these people will never tell you what the law what abortion should not be allowed. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=417.17999999999995s)]
*  They are extremists. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=420.97999999999996s)]
*  They are radical extremists. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=421.86s)]
*  And it is journalistic malpractice for Kamala Harris to repeatedly be allowed to do interviews [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=423.22s)]
*  and never be asked Kamala Harris, what abortions should not be allowed in America? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=429.06s)]
*  Which point is it too far and too bad? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=433.62s)]
*  Never answers that. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=435.74s)]
*  Never. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=436.74s)]
*  She's an extremist. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=437.74s)]
*  They're extremists. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=438.74s)]
*  Well, I will say for the Democrats who are willing to come on the show and have we do [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=439.74s)]
*  have that conversation with them. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=443.06s)]
*  And I agree with you. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=444.18s)]
*  It seems like they also have failed to coalesce around a message for where their limits are [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=445.18s)]
*  in many cases. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=448.62s)]
*  Before you go, though, you're in Florida. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=449.62s)]
*  You're spending time with President Trump. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=451.26000000000005s)]
*  Everyone says you're on his VP shortlist, but that there may be a technical glitch with [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=453.46000000000004s)]
*  having two people from the same state when it comes down to an electoral college vote. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=457.76000000000005s)]
*  Would you leave the state of Florida or change your residency if you were asked to join the ticket? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=461.98s)]
*  Well, first of all, the vice presidential choice for Donald Trump's going to be made [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=467.38000000000005s)]
*  by one person, and that's Donald Trump. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=469.90000000000003s)]
*  And all this other stuff is just speculation. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=471.58000000000004s)]
*  And I get it. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=473.42s)]
*  You know, political reporters have to cover political topics. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=474.42s)]
*  The primaries over the general six months away. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=476.34000000000003s)]
*  So they want to speculate on the VP thing. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=478.86s)]
*  Here's the good news. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=480.9s)]
*  And I saw it this weekend. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=481.9s)]
*  The amount of talent that we have in the Republican Party is extraordinary. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=483.34s)]
*  He doesn't just have a bunch of choices for VP. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=487.12s)]
*  He has a bunch of choices for cabinet. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=489.09999999999997s)]
*  He's going to have an extraordinary group of talented people that can serve this country [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=490.73999999999995s)]
*  in multiple roles. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=494.26s)]
*  And that's a decision he's going to have to make. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=495.62s)]
*  And I would just say, forget leaving me aside for a moment. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=497.65999999999997s)]
*  I think that before anyone decides to move from their state, you better make sure you [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=500.73999999999995s)]
*  move to a state where there's not some D.A. that makes a career after going after Republicans. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=504.14s)]
*  Because what we're seeing all over the country right now is the weaponization of our criminal [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=508.58s)]
*  justice system, not just to go after Donald Trump, which is now well documented, right? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=512.1s)]
*  You have a Biden supporting judge, a Biden prosecutor in the most liberal county in America [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=516.54s)]
*  on ridiculous charges. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=521.62s)]
*  And the rest of the world is watching that saying, you know, this is the stuff that America [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=522.78s)]
*  used to sanction other countries for doing. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=526.22s)]
*  OK. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=527.9399999999999s)]
*  Well, it's happening here in America. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=528.9399999999999s)]
*  But I think that that's something that we need to be focused on, because I do think [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=529.9399999999999s)]
*  that has an impact on people's thinking about getting into politics. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=532.9399999999999s)]
*  OK. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=535.9399999999999s)]
*  If you do move, not to New York, that won't be your choice. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=536.98s)]
*  We got that. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=540.1800000000001s)]
*  But if you decide that's a pretty good, a pretty good guess on that one, if you decide [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=541.1800000000001s)]
*  they have anything to tell us about that or if you want to consider your residency elsewhere, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=545.94s)]
*  let us know. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=550.5s)]
*  Senator, thank you. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=551.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=552.5s)]
*  You can get it all here on YouTube. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTeXnwsMtQ4&t=566.94s)]
