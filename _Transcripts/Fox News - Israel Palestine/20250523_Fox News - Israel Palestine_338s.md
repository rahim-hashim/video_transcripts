# Netanyahu issues scathing rebuke of France, Canada: 'Wrong side of justice'
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY)
*  Turning now to this, two Israeli embassy employees were shot dead Wednesday night with a suspect [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=0.0s)]
*  now charged with murder. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=4.8s)]
*  Middle East analyst and senior fellow at the Philip Merrill Center for Strategic Studies [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=6.92s)]
*  at Johns Hopkins University, Laura Blumenfeld joins me now. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=10.98s)]
*  Laura, thank you so much for joining us in this horrific news event. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=15.32s)]
*  And the investigation into this is, of course, in its early stages, but what we believe to [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=19.76s)]
*  know is this suspect was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois, and then went on to murder [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=23.04s)]
*  two innocent people and shout, Free Palestine. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=29.0s)]
*  So is this an example of something that is deeply wrong with this country? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=32.28s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=36.96s)]
*  He was like the little terrorist that could. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=38.8s)]
*  I think I can. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=41.04s)]
*  I think I can. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=42.04s)]
*  He just repeated slogans to himself often enough to make it true. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=43.2s)]
*  You know, when I heard the terrorist scream on Wednesday night, Free Palestine, the slogan [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=46.68s)]
*  was ringing in my ears because I'd heard it Wednesday morning outside Columbia at my [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=52.64s)]
*  own kid's college graduation, where not only students were booing the president, but when [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=56.96s)]
*  I turned around, there was a mom telling the president of Columbia University, get off [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=61.96s)]
*  the stage because she had arrested protesters the week before. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=66.16s)]
*  Look, I think this proves that free speech might be a right, but it's also a responsibility. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=70.2s)]
*  And the shooting shows the connection between rhetoric and bloodshed is real. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=76.12s)]
*  After the cold-blooded murder on Wednesday, the consequences of this kind of violent rhetoric [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=81.08s)]
*  can't be denied. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  And the victims should have been celebrating the most exciting times in their lives. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  Yaron Lechinsky was a Christian and Sarah Milgram was a U.S. citizen. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=91.64s)]
*  And both of them were working to bring peace to the Middle East, including Gaza. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  And if only the suspect had known that. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=100.64s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=104.52000000000001s)]
*  They weren't, you know, the Yaron was not Jewish. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  He was perceived as Jewish. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=108.4s)]
*  She was a third generation Kansas from the town of Prairie Village, where my mother and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=111.0s)]
*  my grandparents are from. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=116.0s)]
*  These are folks who are raised on corn-fed optimism. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  And in their world, stories can have happy endings. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=122.52s)]
*  And so our only hope is that this brings, drives home a message that terrorism is only [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=126.16s)]
*  about killing. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=130.88s)]
*  It's a terrorism mindset, which in one word is dehumanization. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=131.88s)]
*  How can we make people more human in each other's eyes? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=136.8s)]
*  That's what Yaron and Sarah lived for. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  That was their belief. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=141.72s)]
*  Who is helping the people of Gaza more? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=143.12s)]
*  Those were the inside the museum. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=145.07999999999998s)]
*  They were working on an interfaith joint effort for humanitarian relief across the region [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=146.92s)]
*  or the gunmen outside deranged by violent rhetoric and a wrong approach to society that [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=153.72s)]
*  led to, since with death, he fired 21 bullets. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=159.44s)]
*  Take one moment to think about that, to kill two people. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=163.95999999999998s)]
*  Sarah was alive and trying to crawl away. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=167.2s)]
*  He followed her and shot her. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=169.6s)]
*  She sat up. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=171.48s)]
*  She tried to live and he shot her again. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=172.64s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=174.68s)]
*  So we're going to keep them and their families and our thoughts and prayers as the horrific [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=175.68s)]
*  details of what took place at the scene continue to unfold as we learn more. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=179.44s)]
*  And when it comes to the war itself, Laura, French President Emmanuel Macron, he's pressing [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=184.95999999999998s)]
*  for an immediate recognition of a Palestinian state. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=189.6s)]
*  The UK and Canada have been very critical of Israel's expansion of this war. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=193.4s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said this yesterday. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=198.08s)]
*  I say to President Macron, Prime Minister Carney and Prime Minister Stammer, when mass [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=200.52s)]
*  murderers, rapists, baby killers and kidnappers thank you, you're on the wrong side of justice. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=205.16s)]
*  You're on the wrong side of humanity and you're on the wrong side of history. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=210.88s)]
*  A scathing and pointed criticism from Prime Minister Netanyahu at a time when Israel is [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=215.0s)]
*  being really pressed to withdraw here. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=220.72s)]
*  Well, for Netanyahu, this is a war of survival. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=225.16s)]
*  And his feeling is I'd rather be alive and hated than loved and dead. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=228.07999999999998s)]
*  And that was a lesson that, you know, whether you're saying you draw it from the Holocaust [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=232.4s)]
*  or whether you draw it from the Middle East today, there is little pity for victims in [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=236.51999999999998s)]
*  the Middle East. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=241.04s)]
*  And his feeling is that the strong survive. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=242.35999999999999s)]
*  And when it comes to Iran itself, nuclear talks are set to resume today between the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=245.51999999999998s)]
*  United States and Iran, and it's at a time when the United States has made it clear zero [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=251.52s)]
*  enrichment is the U.S. stance. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=256.0s)]
*  And there are also reports that Israel is preparing for possible strikes on Iranian [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=258.71999999999997s)]
*  nuclear facilities. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=262.2s)]
*  Iran has, of course, responded to that already. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=263.2s)]
*  Where do you see these talks going when they resume in Rome? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=265.84s)]
*  Well, I think that the red line has been drawn. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=269.36s)]
*  And if the United States sticks to that red line, which is no enrichment and there's no [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=272.72s)]
*  daylight between Israel and the United States, there's an opportunity here either to get [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=276.68s)]
*  a deal that everyone can live with and feel good with. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=280.88s)]
*  It won't be a kind of Obama comb over the JCPOA from 2015, but it will be a deal that's [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=283.59999999999997s)]
*  solid and can lay the groundwork for a peaceful Middle East. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=289.44s)]
*  It all begins and ends with Iran. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=292.88s)]
*  And if they don't, if diplomacy doesn't work, then there is that second way. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=295.08s)]
*  Israel feels like it has a historic opportunity now to deliver that showdown blow in a [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=299.12s)]
*  fight that began on October 7th. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=304.23999999999995s)]
*  Israel was behind on that day. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=306.79999999999995s)]
*  And I think that they feel like they need to claw their way back to a place of supremacy [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=308.48s)]
*  because, again, in the Middle East, there's no words that speak louder than the fist. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=312.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. And President Trump has said that he has extended the olive branch, but it won't [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=319.40000000000003s)]
*  last forever. Laura Blumenfeld, thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5zJ3dNXGY&t=323.48s)]
