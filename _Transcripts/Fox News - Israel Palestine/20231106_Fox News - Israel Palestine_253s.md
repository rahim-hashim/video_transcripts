# Ilhan Omar challenger slams the lawmaker for 'sickening' support of 'bloodthirsty killers'
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI)
*  Representatives are supposed to reflect the views of their constituents, but I'd be surprised [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=0.0s)]
*  if the good people of Minnesota are truly represented by someone like Ilhan Omar, who [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=5.44s)]
*  cannot bring herself to condemn Hamas, anti-Semitism, and who traffics in discrimination against [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=10.88s)]
*  Jews. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=17.28s)]
*  She has opposition next fall, so we shall see what the people of Minnesota think. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=18.28s)]
*  Her opponent's name is Dalia Alakidi, and she joins us now. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  Welcome to you. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=27.88s)]
*  Your opponent, just this week, criticized the U.S. for giving money to Israel, like [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=29.959999999999997s)]
*  for the Iron Dome and for self-defense. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=34.68s)]
*  What is your view on that? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=36.72s)]
*  Thank you, Trey, for having me on, and you nailed it. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=38.6s)]
*  I came to Israel from ground zero of anti-Semitism in the United States, led by the most anti-Semitic [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=43.2s)]
*  lowmaker in history. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=52.28s)]
*  I came here to represent the good people of the Fifth District, the good people of Minnesota, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=55.72s)]
*  that we are not a supporter of terrorists like Hamas. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=61.8s)]
*  Trey, I just—last—yesterday, I just viewed the 45-minute horrific video of what Hamas [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=68.32s)]
*  terrorists has done since October 7th. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=76.64s)]
*  I saw them waving ISIS flags. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=80.8s)]
*  So when we say Hamas' ISIS, they have their flags. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=83.64s)]
*  I've seen terrible, terrible scenes that the public hasn't seen yet. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=87.8s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=96.2s)]
*  It's sickening. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=97.48s)]
*  It's sad that we have lowmakers and we have politicians that support these bloodthirsty [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=98.48s)]
*  killers. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=105.28s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=106.28s)]
*  Most people have not seen these videos because they cannot see them. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=109.0s)]
*  They are unwatchable. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=112.56s)]
*  You can't show it on television. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=114.2s)]
*  But Rashida Tlaib, like, makes literally no effort to conceal her anti-Jewish beliefs. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=115.76s)]
*  No effort. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=122.0s)]
*  She accused Joe Biden and the rest of us of committing genocide. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=123.0s)]
*  I wonder if Representative Ilhan Omar believes that also, that the U.S. is supporting a genocide [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=127.28s)]
*  when it backs Israel in defending itself. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=134.04s)]
*  It's enough to watch or to read what she posts on Twitter and Facebook, on social media. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=138.12s)]
*  She's quite clear. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=146.84s)]
*  Actually, she's more poisonous than Rashida Tlaib. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=148.2s)]
*  The thing is, we don't need these people in our country as leaders, as politicians. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=152.92s)]
*  Ilhan Omar, over and over and over, she kept saying since day one that the Jews or Israelis, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=161.52s)]
*  we all remember it's all about the Benjamin. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=170.84s)]
*  So it's quite clear. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=173.64s)]
*  Ilhan Omar, she's never shy of expressing her feelings. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=174.64s)]
*  And that's why we all need to—Americans, we need to unite against these toxic politicians. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=183.4s)]
*  And that's why I wanted to come to Israel, to tell the Israelis that we, Americans, are [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=192.4s)]
*  with you. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=199.24s)]
*  We are not represented by the few who cannot differentiate between good and evil. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=200.56s)]
*  Well, we look forward to watching that race, and we look forward to having you back on. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=208.8s)]
*  I know you want to talk about education and lots of other issues, not simply two Muslim [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=212.44s)]
*  women running from different parties. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=217.28s)]
*  So we will have you on again. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=220.84s)]
*  And thank you so much for joining us on this Sunday night. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=222.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=227.32s)]
*  And I would invite everybody to check Dalia4Congress.org. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=228.32s)]
*  They will know more about where I stand from very important issues for our district. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=233.0s)]
*  Yes, ma'am. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=237.8s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFS_aaHipI&t=239.52s)]
