# Israel reveals lavish lifestyle of Hamas leaders as Gazans suffer
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0)
*  I know Hamas terrorists stealing food from children in Gaza while their leaders are living [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=0.0s)]
*  in luxury with billions of dollars in money. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=5.8s)]
*  That's all according to the Israeli embassy. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=8.6s)]
*  Eric, Sean's watching that story live in New York with us now. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=10.52s)]
*  And Eric, what did you find out? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=13.24s)]
*  Hello. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=14.6s)]
*  Well, it's unbelievable, Bill. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=15.6s)]
*  The people of Gaza, as you know, well, they suffer under the horror of Hamas. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=17.1s)]
*  But for the terror group's leaders, it's the Hamas high life, reports of private jets, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=22.12s)]
*  lavish hotel suites, and fancy mansions. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=26.92s)]
*  Israel says the Hamas leaders are billionaires. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=30.439999999999998s)]
*  Khalid Mashal and Ishmael Haianah worth $4 billion each. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=33.44s)]
*  And the guy on the right, he's political leader, Busu Abu Marzouk. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=38.2s)]
*  I've interviewed him. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=41.879999999999995s)]
*  The guy's worth $3 billion. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  This video from the Israeli embassy to the U.S. says Hamas earns more than $1 billion [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=47.28s)]
*  a year. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=52.64s)]
*  Take a look at Khalid Mashal. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=53.96s)]
*  They say these guys get a cut of all that. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=56.0s)]
*  He's the former Hamas chief. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=57.72s)]
*  Man, can that guy play table tennis. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=59.2s)]
*  And here he is squeezing in a workout at a treadmill in Qatar. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  Well, the U.S. Treasury Department says Hamas' global financial network includes cryptocurrency, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=65.76s)]
*  real estate, legitimate businesses. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=73.08s)]
*  They also tax and extort money from Gaza residents. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=74.68s)]
*  Jonathan Schanzer from the Foundation for Defense of Democracy says Hamas leaders have [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=78.2s)]
*  enriched themselves on terror money. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=82.84s)]
*  I think it's just really the numbers that are shocking, looking at the sheer amount [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=85.72000000000001s)]
*  of money that some of these terror chiefs have been able to sock away. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=89.84s)]
*  And there is no accountability, because, of course, there's no accountability in these [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  countries that support terrorism. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=98.48s)]
*  Reports say Hamas leaders have enjoyed the luxury of the Four Seasons Hotel in Doha, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=101.12s)]
*  Qatar. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=106.88000000000001s)]
*  That's where rooms go for as much as $1,500 a night. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=107.88000000000001s)]
*  But the company tells us, quote, Four Seasons confirms that Ishmael Haiena is not living [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=111.48s)]
*  at or staying at the Four Seasons Hotel Doha. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=115.96s)]
*  But we asked about the other Hamas leaders, and so far the Four Seasons has not gotten [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=119.48s)]
*  back to us about whether they're checked in or have used their hotel in the past. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=124.6s)]
*  Schanzer blames Qatar and Turkey for coddling the Hamas leaders. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=129.6s)]
*  You know, Qatar says it will revisit its relationship with the terror group after the war. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=133.28s)]
*  Turkey, where some of the other Hamas leaders live, it continues to back Hamas. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=138.72s)]
*  Says something when the Four Seasons needs to put out a statement, Eric. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  Thank you for that. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=147.39999999999998s)]
*  Eric Schaun here in New York, thanks. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAILrHpZJu0&t=148.39999999999998s)]
