# Bin Laden's 'Letter to America' goes viral with young people
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5R3wIekZo8)
*  All right, a disturbing document written two decades ago by the mastermind of the 9-11 attacks [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5R3wIekZo8&t=0.0s)]
*  is resurfacing on one of the biggest social media platforms in the country. Osama bin Laden's [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5R3wIekZo8&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  infamous A Letter to America, which condemns the United States for its support of Israel, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5R3wIekZo8&t=10.8s)]
*  is now going viral on TikTok and it appears to be gaining sympathy. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5R3wIekZo8&t=15.52s)]
*  Of all the things you could never imagine, the words of Al-Qaeda's former leader ringing true [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5R3wIekZo8&t=20.56s)]
*  with some TikTok influencers who are encouraging others to read it for themselves. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5R3wIekZo8&t=25.84s)]
*  We'll get reaction from Charlie Heard on how the twisted rhetoric is erupting here in the United [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5R3wIekZo8&t=32.0s)]
*  States. But first let's get to William LaGineste. He's live in Los Angeles for us. William, what led [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5R3wIekZo8&t=36.64s)]
*  to these viral videos? Well, it all started, Sandra, with a 25-year-old LA influencer whose [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5R3wIekZo8&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  TikTok post on the bin Laden letter went viral. So Americans watch about three billion hours of [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5R3wIekZo8&t=49.52s)]
*  TikTok every month, a third get their news there, and that's why this incident in the last 24 hours [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5R3wIekZo8&t=56.64s)]
*  on social media scares a lot of people. The post linked to a letter written by Osama bin Laden 20 [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5R3wIekZo8&t=62.24s)]
*  years ago on a webpage of a British newspaper. The letter says Jews have no right to be in Israel [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5R3wIekZo8&t=67.44s)]
*  and blames America for the violence in the Middle East. She says, quote, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5R3wIekZo8&t=73.04s)]
*  I need everyone to stop what they're doing right now and go read the letter because, quote, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5R3wIekZo8&t=77.52s)]
*  I'm going through like an existential crisis. Well, people did. That video got some 2 million [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5R3wIekZo8&t=82.96s)]
*  views and 200,000 likes, with most saying they too feel angry, manipulated and lied to by the media [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5R3wIekZo8&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  and U.S. schools. For someone on TikTok to somehow suggest that this is America's fault [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5R3wIekZo8&t=96.96s)]
*  or that bin Laden, who killed thousands of innocent Americans, was right, is absolutely [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5R3wIekZo8&t=103.92s)]
*  disgusting and further evidence that we need to ban TikTok. So the conversation then migrated [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5R3wIekZo8&t=109.6s)]
*  from TikTok over to Reddit and Twitter, where hundreds of thousands agreed with her video and [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5R3wIekZo8&t=117.04s)]
*  posted similar views on the anti-American letter with no context on bin Laden 9-11 or beheadings [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5R3wIekZo8&t=122.24000000000001s)]
*  celebrated by al-Qaeda. At that point of media consumption, it becomes hard for young people [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5R3wIekZo8&t=129.6s)]
*  to know that there are disconfirming views out there. And so they tend to believe narratives [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5R3wIekZo8&t=136.96s)]
*  that they are exposed to through social media and through each other. So TikTok has since taken down [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5R3wIekZo8&t=142.72s)]
*  that influencer's video saying, quote, the letter she promoted violates rules on supporting terrorism. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5R3wIekZo8&t=150.48s)]
*  It happens on every platform, not just ours. So it's TikTok getting a lot of heat on this. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5R3wIekZo8&t=156.56s)]
*  That influencer, by the way, Sandra, makes, told the LA Times she makes about $15,000 or $200,000 [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5R3wIekZo8&t=161.52s)]
*  a year doing YouTube videos on makeup, diet and fashion, not history. Back to you. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5R3wIekZo8&t=167.84s)]
*  All right. William Wojniewicz on that for us. William, thank you. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5R3wIekZo8&t=173.52s)]
*  Get it anywhere else. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5R3wIekZo8&t=186.56s)]
