# Hamas responds to Biden's hostage deal claim
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [February 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg)
*  So the ultimate weapon perhaps coming closer to reality in the country of Iran, the UN's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=0.0s)]
*  nuclear watchdog finding that Tehran is further boosting its overall stockpile of uranium [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  and keeping its nuclear program away from the eyes of the agency's most seasoned inspectors. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=11.22s)]
*  Former Secretary of State Fox News contributor Mike Pompeo, sir, good morning to you. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=16.52s)]
*  Here are the three headlines. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=20.52s)]
*  Inspectors are not given access. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=21.52s)]
*  The stockpile of uranium is higher, as I just mentioned there. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=23.88s)]
*  And the rich uranium is at what's considered 60% purity. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=26.68s)]
*  Based on the article that I read, to get to 90%, you do that very simply once you're at [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=31.64s)]
*  60%. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  So they're close. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=38.68s)]
*  Yes, Bill, good morning. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=39.68s)]
*  Now, they're close, and you're right. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=42.68s)]
*  It doesn't take long. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  You spin some centrifuges. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=46.0s)]
*  They have the equipment to do that. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=47.42s)]
*  And all of this has been enabled by the decision that was made early on by the Biden administration [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=49.36s)]
*  to allow them to continue to build these programs up by getting out of the JCPOA and [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=53.4s)]
*  ceasing to enforce the sanctions regime, which denied them the very money that they need [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=58.4s)]
*  to continue to spin their centrifuges and build their nuclear capabilities. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=62.2s)]
*  It's very concerning. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=66.64s)]
*  Imagine sitting in the same context with what happened on October 7th with a nuclear-armed [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=68.0s)]
*  Iran. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=72.4s)]
*  The dynamics would be very different, even more difficult than they are today. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=73.88s)]
*  And this administration has done literally nothing to stop Iran from continuing to build [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=77.36s)]
*  its program. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=81.64s)]
*  The poor IEA is now shut out. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=82.88s)]
*  Yeah, that's an interesting scenario. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=84.48s)]
*  Say Tehran comes out with the alert a month from now or six months from now. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=88.68s)]
*  How does the region change, in your view, immediately? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=92.92s)]
*  I think it changes two very important ways. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=98.92s)]
*  First is, I think the Israelis would understand that they've got to take action that is even [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=102.04s)]
*  more serious, more concerted, more focused than they have taken to date. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=106.08s)]
*  I don't think Israel can allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon or a nuclear weapons program. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=110.55999999999999s)]
*  Second, the Gulf Arab states, Bill, will almost certainly feel compelled to head down the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=114.55999999999999s)]
*  same path. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  And so we will then have multiple nuclear-armed nations in the Middle East. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  This proliferation is at a terrible risk. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=124.75999999999999s)]
*  It's one of the reasons we worked so hard to build the Abraham Accords, was to prevent [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=126.32s)]
*  precisely this kind of activity from taking place. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=130.2s)]
*  Let's move to another topic. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=133.4s)]
*  I don't know if we get a deal with Hamas or not, but here was Joe Biden in New York yesterday [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=134.4s)]
*  when he was asked about it at the ice cream shop right down the street. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=139.12s)]
*  Can you give us a sense of when you think that ceasefire will start, sir? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=142.12s)]
*  Well, I hope by the end of the weekend. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=146.12s)]
*  I mean, the end of the weekend. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=149.12s)]
*  At least my national security advisor tells me that we're close. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=152.12s)]
*  We're close. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=155.12s)]
*  We're not done yet. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=156.12s)]
*  And my hope is by next Monday. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=157.12s)]
*  I don't know what your read is on that. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=159.12s)]
*  This whole thing about referring to Jake Sullivan, fine, but I mean, he's the commander in chief. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=162.12s)]
*  He owns the decision, does he not, as opposed to Jake Sullivan? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=166.64s)]
*  He does. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=169.92s)]
*  He does. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=170.92s)]
*  That's so odd. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=171.92s)]
*  Vibes and ice cream is the method by which you communicate your hostage policy. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=172.92s)]
*  Look, it has been an enormous mistake of the administration to put so much pressure on [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=177.16s)]
*  Israel to stand down, call it a ceasefire, call it a pause. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=181.04s)]
*  The Israeli people can't be sold out by the American administration. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=184.6s)]
*  They've got to complete this task. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  They cannot allow Hamas to continue to have weapons and capabilities on their border in [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=189.51999999999998s)]
*  the south and west of their country. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=194.32s)]
*  And they're going to finish this task. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=195.8s)]
*  I don't know what President Biden is thinking. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=197.32s)]
*  I don't know why he would sell out Israel in this way. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=199.24s)]
*  Israel needs to complete this task. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=202.24s)]
*  It's not only in Israel's best interest. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=203.62s)]
*  It's in the Gulf Arab States' best interest. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=205.44s)]
*  It's in America's best interest as well. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=207.4s)]
*  You know, Bill, these Hamas guys, they are literally an extended arm of the very Iranians [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=209.0s)]
*  we were speaking about earlier. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=213.32s)]
*  That's the task at hand. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=215.07999999999998s)]
*  And the president should not be halting them or hindering them. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=216.36s)]
*  He should be encouraging them to finish this task quickly. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=218.84s)]
*  Netanyahu says, I think we're there. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=222.16s)]
*  Here's what Hamas said to Biden's comments. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=223.96s)]
*  Hamas official telling Reuters the U.S. president's comments on the prospects of an imminent halt [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=226.12s)]
*  in Gaza are premature, do not match the situation on the ground. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=230.32s)]
*  Officials saying there are still big gaps that need to be bridged before a truce. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=234.0s)]
*  I tell you what, you get hostages out of there alive. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=237.6s)]
*  It's going to be an amazing, an extraordinary moment for the world. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=240.88s)]
*  And let's hope and pray that it does happen. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=245.48000000000002s)]
*  Mike Pompeo, thank you for your time. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=247.56s)]
*  Thanks, Bill. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=249.36s)]
*  We'll hold on to hope. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5mSVu7nfg&t=250.36s)]
