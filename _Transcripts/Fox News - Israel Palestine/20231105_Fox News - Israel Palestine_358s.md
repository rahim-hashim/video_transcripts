# Tlaib, Omar should be critical of Hamas if they care about Palestinians: Zeldin
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE)
*  It's been kind of disturbing to us. I've heard Democrats suggest that there needs to be a ceasefire. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=0.0s)]
*  Let us be clear. We've been very clear about this. There was a ceasefire. It was before October 7th. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=4.8s)]
*  And Hamas broke it. Israel doesn't need a ceasefire. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=10.4s)]
*  It needs its allies to cease with the politics and deliver support now. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=14.0s)]
*  And that's what we're doing. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=18.0s)]
*  Well, that's House Speaker Mike Johnson, of course, brushing aside calls for a ceasefire. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=19.3s)]
*  Well, some progressives in the Democratic Party, well, they've been ramping up their pro-Palestinian rhetoric. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=24.1s)]
*  One outspoken squad member, Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, accused the president of supporting genocide [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=29.799999999999997s)]
*  by backing Israel's offensive in the Gaza Strip against the terrorists of Hamas. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=35.8s)]
*  This comes, of course, after nine Democrats and one Republican voted against supporting Israel in the House. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=40.8s)]
*  Former Republican New York Congressman Lee Zeldin joins us now. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=47.4s)]
*  He was co-chair of the House Republican Israel Caucus and co-chair of the Black Jewish Caucus. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=50.8s)]
*  And joins us here in the studio. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=56.3s)]
*  Congressman, good to see you. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=57.8s)]
*  Always good to see you. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  Of course. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=60.199999999999996s)]
*  You were one of the lone Republican Jewish members of the House. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  Does it pain you to hear some of this rhetoric now coming from some members of the Democratic Party? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=65.2s)]
*  100 percent. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=70.2s)]
*  And I hope that the rest of the Democratic Party is successful in being able to root this out from their ranks. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=71.6s)]
*  It's important for leaders of the Democratic Party to be leading their followers as opposed to being led by their followers. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=78.2s)]
*  The rhetoric that we're hearing from members of Congress, some are inside on college campuses, some are on the streets. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  And it's painful for American foreign policy, for this relationship with Israel, for Jews all throughout our country, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=92.4s)]
*  especially Jewish students on these college campuses. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=100.60000000000001s)]
*  And we shouldn't act naive. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=103.2s)]
*  We shouldn't make believe like what Rashida Tlaib is saying has some type of alternate meaning. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=104.5s)]
*  Take her for exactly what it's worth at face value. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=112.2s)]
*  She supports a one state solution. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=115.8s)]
*  She's outspoken on this. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=118.4s)]
*  She believes in one state solution where Israel doesn't exist. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=119.9s)]
*  When she says that it's a peaceful position, a river to the sea, this is a position, this is rhetoric that is being engaged for people who want to wipe Israel off of the map. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=123.8s)]
*  Rashida Tlaib hasn't condemned Hamas. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=137.0s)]
*  She hasn't condemned what happened on October 7th, naming the babies getting beheaded and the innocent civilians who were raped and the executions and the hostages. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=138.6s)]
*  She's not calling for Hamas to release these hostages. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=148.0s)]
*  So instead of us taking a step back and acting confused, like we don't know what she stands for, what she's really calling for, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  how about we act very intelligently, taking it at face value and we deal with it upfront? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=160.9s)]
*  Or Hillary Vandau in Washington asked Congresswoman Tlaib about the, does she support batting of the babies or condemn it? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=165.9s)]
*  She wouldn't even answer that question. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=172.5s)]
*  River to the sea. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=174.5s)]
*  Let me make it very clear to our viewers what that means. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=175.5s)]
*  When they chant from the river to the sea, that means kill all the Jews. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=178.0s)]
*  We want Israel wiped out. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=182.0s)]
*  We don't want Israel to exist. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=183.8s)]
*  From the Jordan River to the sea, meaning the Mediterranean. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=186.3s)]
*  But here's what Congresswoman Tlaib tweeted about that. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=189.70000000000002s)]
*  She says, no, quote, from the river to the sea is an aspirational call for freedom, human rights and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction or hate. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=192.5s)]
*  Your response? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=205.5s)]
*  And peaceful coexistence means that Jews in Israel are able to coexist. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=206.5s)]
*  She does not support a two state solution. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=213.8s)]
*  She supports a one state solution. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=216.20000000000002s)]
*  Peaceful coexistence, especially right now. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=218.7s)]
*  I mean, she's blaming Israel for the bombing of a hospital that terrorists are responsible for. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=222.4s)]
*  And it's one thing for her to say upfront because maybe she thought Israel was responsible for it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=229.9s)]
*  But then as a sitting member of Congress, you have access to intelligence at some of the highest levels. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=235.0s)]
*  You are now informed that this wasn't Israel was in fact caused by terrorists. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=240.2s)]
*  What do you do? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=245.1s)]
*  You're supposed to say, well, I was mistaken. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=245.7s)]
*  Instead, she doubles down and she still blamed Israel for it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=248.2s)]
*  She stood in front of the Capitol blaming Israel for it with people who were then storming the Capitol complex after she was issuing this call. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=251.39999999999998s)]
*  Why do they not understand that? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=260.8s)]
*  For example, Ilhan Omar talked about bombing refugee camps. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=263.59999999999997s)]
*  Yet at the same time, Israel says those refugee camps are Hamas headquarters. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=267.09999999999997s)]
*  This is something where you would expect if you actually if Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar care about innocent Palestinian civilians, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=273.0s)]
*  they should be quite critical of Hamas using these innocent civilians as human shields. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=281.59999999999997s)]
*  They should be critical of Hamas going after innocent civilians when they are trying to leave to safer places of Gaza. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=287.5s)]
*  Instead, Hamas is targeting these civilians. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=296.4s)]
*  Oh, and by the way, Hamas was elected to run Gaza. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=298.8s)]
*  We shouldn't make believe that Hamas just came in, that there wasn't some election and they they just took over and everyone's opposed to them. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=304.7s)]
*  And I'll tell you one other piece of this that's greatly concerning is that this is multigenerational. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=312.1s)]
*  You see with UNRWA funds and textbooks, it's been an issue for years. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=317.5s)]
*  You have a younger generation that is being taught with textbooks where they show a map of the region. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=322.1s)]
*  There is no Israel. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=328.7s)]
*  So this isn't something that just magically goes away. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=330.4s)]
*  You just you use some word. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=333.5s)]
*  Let's have a ceasefire. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=334.8s)]
*  Mike Johnson's right. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=336.2s)]
*  There was a ceasefire. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=337.2s)]
*  On October 7th, the world changed and I fear that the world permanently changed and you can't just expect Israel to just stand down in response to it. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=338.7s)]
*  They have an inherent right of self-defense. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=348.3s)]
*  They have to stick up for its people and the United States would be smart to stand by our great ally. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=350.4s)]
*  And we're doing that now, Congressman Lee Zeldin. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=354.7s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hXVt78YVE&t=357.09999999999997s)]
