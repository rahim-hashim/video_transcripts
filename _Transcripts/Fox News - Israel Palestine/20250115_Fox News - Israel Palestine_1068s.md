# Israel, Hamas reach cease-fire deal that will return hostages
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs)
*  that it has now been confirmed. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=0.0s)]
*  Teward Fox News, a ceasefire deal has been reached [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=1.68s)]
*  between Israel and Hamas after 15 months of war [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  and the taking of those hostages, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=9.28s)]
*  many from different countries, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=11.44s)]
*  but certainly America on that list. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=12.66s)]
*  The hostages are in part part of this agreement. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=15.4s)]
*  Let's go straight away to Trey Yinks, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=19.6s)]
*  who is live for us in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=21.8s)]
*  Trey? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=23.88s)]
*  Yeah, Harris, this is breaking news right now, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=26.52s)]
*  according to a source familiar with the ongoing talks, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=29.0s)]
*  a ceasefire deal has been reached [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=32.48s)]
*  between Israel and Hamas. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=34.96s)]
*  I do wanna just read to you what this source just sent, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=36.8s)]
*  quote, Gaza's ceasefire and hostage release deal [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=39.6s)]
*  reached following the Qataris meeting [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=42.32s)]
*  with Hamas negotiators for a final push [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  following last minute additions by the group. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=47.16s)]
*  There were some reports that indicated Hamas officials [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=49.84s)]
*  were trying to push the Israelis to change their position [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=52.56s)]
*  about a key corridor that sits along the Gaza-Egypt border [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=56.48s)]
*  called the Philadelphia Corridor. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=60.16s)]
*  Now, I am told that the Qatari Prime Minister himself [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=62.04s)]
*  was in the negotiating room and pushed these Hamas officials [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=65.12s)]
*  to accept the agreement on the table. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=68.94s)]
*  What we are looking at here that will be signed tonight, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=71.2s)]
*  a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=73.97999999999999s)]
*  that will implement a pause in fighting [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=76.84s)]
*  between the two sides for 42 days, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  this is a six week agreement that will ultimately see [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=81.68s)]
*  33 hostages released from Hamas captivity in Gaza. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=85.2s)]
*  We are told by a number of sources, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=89.88s)]
*  some of those hostages were killed [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=92.2s)]
*  and their bodies will be returned to Israel, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=94.84s)]
*  but at least 23 of them are believed to be alive. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=97.38s)]
*  This is critical information for the Israelis, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  they have been negotiating over the past several weeks [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=103.84s)]
*  trying to get together the details of such an agreement. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=106.58s)]
*  Now, they will have to give up a number [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=110.16s)]
*  of Palestinian prisoners in exchange [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=112.12s)]
*  for these hostages that are being held inside Gaza. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=114.80000000000001s)]
*  In a briefing earlier this week, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=117.92s)]
*  I was told by a senior Israeli government official [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=119.64s)]
*  that hundreds of Palestinian prisoners [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=122.76s)]
*  will be released as part of this agreement [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=125.28s)]
*  that will ultimately be implemented [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=127.92s)]
*  in three separate phases. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=129.8s)]
*  We're also told that if phase one moves forward as planned, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=131.56s)]
*  that by day 16 of the ceasefire agreement, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=135.82s)]
*  intense discussions about phase two will start, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=139.08s)]
*  at which point they will move forward [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=142.16s)]
*  with implementing phase two later on, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=144.0s)]
*  and then ultimately if everything goes as planned, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=146.16s)]
*  Israeli forces would withdraw from the Gaza Strip, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=149.16s)]
*  all of the hostages and the bodies being held by Hamas [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=152.04s)]
*  would be released and you would have an end [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=154.84s)]
*  to this more than 15 month conflict [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=157.6s)]
*  that erupted here in the Middle East on October 7th. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=159.82s)]
*  Harris. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=162.72s)]
*  All right, I wanna slow us down for a bit. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=163.56s)]
*  This is in two phases, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=165.24s)]
*  talk to me specifically about this phase one, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=166.64s)]
*  cause you can wait 16 days for the other phase, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=169.22s)]
*  who even knows if we'll get there, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=171.4s)]
*  but this is the one that counts [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=173.4s)]
*  because this is all about the hostages. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=174.8s)]
*  So those details again, 23 are believed to be alive. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=176.92000000000002s)]
*  Do we know how many are Americans among them? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=181.6s)]
*  So we don't know how many of the Israeli Americans [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=186.36s)]
*  are included on that first list, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=188.9s)]
*  but just to give you a sense of the sourcing in all of this, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=190.92000000000002s)]
*  we've been talking not only with the Israelis, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=193.56s)]
*  but the Qataris with Hamas leadership, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=195.98000000000002s)]
*  and also with the incoming Trump administration [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=198.32s)]
*  to get a clear picture of what's happening [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=200.70000000000002s)]
*  in these negotiations that just concluded tonight [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=202.96s)]
*  with a resolution to weeks of back and forth conversations. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=206.04000000000002s)]
*  According to many of the officials we've talked with, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=209.72s)]
*  phase one will focus on 33 hostages. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=212.60000000000002s)]
*  A source familiar with the list says that [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=215.84s)]
*  among those people that will be released, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=219.88s)]
*  the young girls who were the observers [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=222.52s)]
*  in the Israeli army along the border, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=224.8s)]
*  five of them who were taken by Hamas on October 7th [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=226.60000000000002s)]
*  into the Gaza strip, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  they are expected to be released. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=231.76s)]
*  Among that list also, any sort of humanitarian hostages. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=233.92s)]
*  Now to give you a definition here [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=237.64s)]
*  of what we're being provided with from Israeli officials, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=239.07999999999998s)]
*  humanitarian hostages mean any women, children, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=241.67999999999998s)]
*  or anyone who was injured. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=245.54s)]
*  Along that list, you'll also see any elderly individuals, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=247.23999999999998s)]
*  people 50 and above. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=250.16s)]
*  So the people not included in phase one [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=252.07999999999998s)]
*  will be young male soldiers that were taken on October 7th, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=254.48s)]
*  and any of the male civilians that were taken [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=258.32s)]
*  into the Gaza strip on that horrendous day. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=260.86s)]
*  If this moves forward as planned, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=263.74s)]
*  we are told by officials here in the region [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=265.62s)]
*  that on the very first day of implementation, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=268.2s)]
*  and this could be as early as this weekend, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=270.46s)]
*  three hostages will be released. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=272.82s)]
*  They will be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=274.58s)]
*  There will then be a six day waiting period [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=277.82s)]
*  to ensure that this moves forward, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=279.9s)]
*  and then additional hostages will be released. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=282.1s)]
*  There is a lot of distrust among both sides [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=284.42s)]
*  of this agreement. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=287.03999999999996s)]
*  It's a very shaky deal, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=288.1s)]
*  but again, it has moved forward to the point [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=289.76s)]
*  where it appears tonight, according to regional officials, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=291.74s)]
*  phase one will start to be implemented in the days ahead, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=295.14s)]
*  and as early as this weekend, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=298.24s)]
*  we will see alive Israeli hostages [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=299.96s)]
*  released from the Gaza strip. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=302.82s)]
*  Harris. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=304.64s)]
*  Well, look, I was watching last night on social media, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=305.48s)]
*  and they were playing music in some of the squares [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=308.03999999999996s)]
*  around the country of Israel, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=311.2s)]
*  and people praying and hoping that this could be true [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=313.36s)]
*  about the hostages. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=317.28s)]
*  So I know that that country now sees some hope [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=318.4s)]
*  with regard to this. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=322.23999999999995s)]
*  What I'm questioning is about who they're letting go. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=324.0s)]
*  Do we know? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=327.08s)]
*  What is the exchange for for these prisoners? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=328.23999999999995s)]
*  And what do they anticipate will be the recidivism [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=330.64s)]
*  of killing among those terrorists, and how soon? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=333.08s)]
*  Yeah, Harris, I can tell you that surprisingly, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=337.96s)]
*  this hostage deal is not popular among all Israelis. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=340.4s)]
*  Even some of the families of those being held inside Gaza [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=344.23999999999995s)]
*  have expressed concern about the agreement on the table, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=347.88s)]
*  but the Israeli people are in a catch-22. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=351.0s)]
*  They want their hostages home [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=353.59999999999997s)]
*  that were taken more than 15 months ago, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=355.4s)]
*  but they also don't want to release convicted terrorists. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=358.2s)]
*  But that's exactly what is going to happen. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=361.23999999999995s)]
*  According to an Israeli government source [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=362.96s)]
*  that I spoke with earlier this week, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=365.32s)]
*  as part of this entire agreement, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=367.35999999999996s)]
*  hundreds of Palestinian prisoners will be released, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=368.88s)]
*  among them people who are convicted of murder. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=372.03999999999996s)]
*  And so you have to look back [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=375.64s)]
*  in a short history here for the region. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=377.28s)]
*  There was a hostage deal where one Israeli soldier [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=379.88s)]
*  was released from Gaza a number of years ago [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=383.03999999999996s)]
*  for 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=385.88s)]
*  Now among those prisoners was Yahya Sinwar, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=388.35999999999996s)]
*  the leader of Hamas and one of the masterminds [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=391.0s)]
*  behind the October 7th massacre. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=393.08s)]
*  And the real concern here is that some of these prisoners [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=394.91999999999996s)]
*  could go back to committing acts of terrorism. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=397.91999999999996s)]
*  Harris, I do want to just read to you here, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=400.71999999999997s)]
*  as we're speaking, we understand [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=402.28s)]
*  that President-elect Trump has taken to true social, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=404.36s)]
*  commenting on this news tonight out of the Middle East. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=407.84s)]
*  He says, quote, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=410.24s)]
*  We have a deal for the hostages in the Middle East. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=411.24s)]
*  They will be released shortly. Thank you. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=414.04s)]
*  This is really an important part of this entire story [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=416.84s)]
*  because remember the President-elect [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=419.84s)]
*  from just in the days after the election [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=421.88s)]
*  was being very, very clear with Hamas [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=424.4s)]
*  that a deal needed to be reached before he was inaugurated [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=426.76s)]
*  to get these hostages home. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=430.08s)]
*  And just days before the inauguration, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=432.0s)]
*  that deal was reached in the Middle East [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=434.2s)]
*  and this process will begin. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=436.15999999999997s)]
*  Harris. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=437.92s)]
*  My co-hosts will come in with their own questions. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=438.76s)]
*  I just want to reset for everyone [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=441.0s)]
*  who may just be tuning in and learning of the agreement [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=442.8s)]
*  between Israel and the savages, the terrorists, Hamas, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=447.2s)]
*  have now reached a deal and we're not certain, you know, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=451.56s)]
*  if freeing hostages will happen imminently, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=455.28s)]
*  immediately what that timetable will look like. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=458.48s)]
*  Trey Yanks is doing a brilliant job as he always does, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=461.40000000000003s)]
*  reporting from the Middle East, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=464.24s)]
*  but things don't happen until they happen. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=465.76s)]
*  So we're not making any more promises [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=467.56s)]
*  than we're looking at dozens of them being released. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=469.8s)]
*  Some will come in the form of remains. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=472.8s)]
*  At least 23 are believed to be alive. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=475.52000000000004s)]
*  And you heard Trey lay out the parameters [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=478.2s)]
*  of who will be freed now, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=480.76s)]
*  according to this reported agreement [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=482.68s)]
*  between Israel and Hamas. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=484.88s)]
*  Young women, the observers who were with the Israeli army [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=486.8s)]
*  and taken hostages, the elderly women over the age of 50. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=491.08s)]
*  Male soldiers, male civilians may be released, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=495.84s)]
*  and this is the deal, in phase two, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=498.96s)]
*  which will be 16 days after this agreement [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=501.52s)]
*  is made public in full and everything begins to take point. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=506.15999999999997s)]
*  So maybe that's today, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=510.12s)]
*  maybe that's tonight or tomorrow, we don't know. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=511.36s)]
*  But 16 days after that, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=513.88s)]
*  we'll look at men being freed as hostages by Hamas. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=516.0s)]
*  Kayleigh. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=519.92s)]
*  You know, Trey, as I think about this, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=521.2s)]
*  I think today's January 15th, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=524.08s)]
*  and I think about three days from now it's January 18th. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=526.36s)]
*  That day was dubbed the saddest birthday in the world [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=530.36s)]
*  because Kefir Bebis turned one in captivity. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=533.12s)]
*  My family, my children know his name. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=536.52s)]
*  Every night we pray for Kefir, his five-year-old brother, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=538.16s)]
*  Ariel, his mom, Shiri, his dad, Yarden. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=541.16s)]
*  His family pleaded for a deal. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=544.12s)]
*  They said, please, please do this before it's too late. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=546.48s)]
*  So on one hand, you think about these hostage families [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=549.88s)]
*  and what it means for them as they wait with bated breath [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=552.36s)]
*  to see if little Kefir can celebrate his second birthday [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=554.6s)]
*  with his family. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=557.82s)]
*  On the other hand, geostrategically, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=559.02s)]
*  as you zoom out here, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=560.78s)]
*  Antony Blinken, Secretary of State, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=562.08s)]
*  made some comments at an Atlantic Council event yesterday [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=563.7s)]
*  that caught my eye, and I wanna read them. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=566.16s)]
*  This is paraphrasing. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=568.4s)]
*  Antony Blinken noted that new Hamas recruits [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=569.6800000000001s)]
*  have nearly replaced the losses incurred [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=572.4200000000001s)]
*  in the war in Gaza. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=575.64s)]
*  What are you hearing? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=577.48s)]
*  I mean, that is a stunning thing [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=578.46s)]
*  if new Hamas recruits have replaced [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=579.96s)]
*  all of the victories Israel has had in the last two years. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=582.84s)]
*  Yeah, Kayleigh, it's a bottom line for the Israelis [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=588.38s)]
*  that they have to accept the reality of the situation [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=591.12s)]
*  on the ground. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=594.12s)]
*  And it's not great when you look at the strategy [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=595.24s)]
*  for the military. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=598.08s)]
*  I was inside Gaza in the area of Jabalia last week [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=598.98s)]
*  with Israeli forces, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=602.3199999999999s)]
*  and they were fighting Hamas militants [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=603.88s)]
*  in the northern part of the strip, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=606.12s)]
*  again, more than 15 months into this war. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=607.76s)]
*  You heard the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=610.1s)]
*  there just yesterday saying they believe [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=612.52s)]
*  that Hamas has now recruited just as many fighters [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=615.2800000000001s)]
*  as they lost. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=617.9200000000001s)]
*  And we're talking anywhere from 17 to 20,000 [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=618.84s)]
*  since the beginning of this conflict. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=621.84s)]
*  And so while the war will take a pause, it's not over. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=624.36s)]
*  And the Israelis have not reached that critical objective [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=627.9000000000001s)]
*  that they laid out at the very beginning of this conflict [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=631.58s)]
*  to completely dismantle and destroy Hamas [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=634.6600000000001s)]
*  inside the Gaza Strip. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=637.1s)]
*  There are massive questions about what the day after [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=638.62s)]
*  looks like inside Gaza. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=641.38s)]
*  And while the focus for the Israeli people right now [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=643.34s)]
*  is just ensuring that these hostages come home, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=646.0400000000001s)]
*  they do look at the death toll among their soldiers. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=649.22s)]
*  And they point to that as oftentimes something [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=651.98s)]
*  that will stick with the Israeli psyche [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=654.82s)]
*  for decades to come. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=656.58s)]
*  More than 400 Israeli soldiers have been killed [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=658.0200000000001s)]
*  fighting Hamas since the ground operation began in late October. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=660.5s)]
*  And they don't even know if this ceasefire deal will hold. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=665.02s)]
*  They don't know if all of these hostages will come home. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=667.98s)]
*  And even talking to top officials here in Tel Aviv [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=670.98s)]
*  and also in Jerusalem, they're not sure [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=673.88s)]
*  among the list of hostages that they've received from Hamas [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=676.48s)]
*  who's still alive. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=679.54s)]
*  And so it is just a horrific situation here in the region. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=681.08s)]
*  And while there will be a pause in the fighting that [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=684.34s)]
*  will allow, according to the initial statements and reports [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=686.54s)]
*  that we're getting from negotiators, some of those hostages [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=690.22s)]
*  to be released, more aid to enter the Gaza Strip, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=693.38s)]
*  and a deal to be in place for a short amount of time, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=696.34s)]
*  it certainly does not mean an end to this conflict. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=699.3000000000001s)]
*  And it doesn't mean an end to the suffering for people here [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=702.34s)]
*  in the region. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=705.1800000000001s)]
*  Kayleigh, Harris? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=706.14s)]
*  Trey, for those in that region, to your point, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=707.7s)]
*  that see this as a longstanding centuries worth of infighting [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=710.5s)]
*  and hatred between each other, including [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=715.4200000000001s)]
*  the date selected of October 7th as significance for Hamas [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=717.42s)]
*  and those terrorist sympathizers. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=722.18s)]
*  The question is, this is seen as a pause in the battle, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=724.5s)]
*  but certainly not the war. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=727.9s)]
*  We know that the stated objectives [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=729.38s)]
*  of these terrorist groups who are acting in concert right [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=731.02s)]
*  now include surges and waves of continued terror attacks, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=733.74s)]
*  and that this Hamas invasion of October 7th [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=738.18s)]
*  was merely a test, a first step to see what, in fact, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=740.2199999999999s)]
*  the response would be of Israel, Europe, and the United States [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=744.2s)]
*  of America. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=747.6800000000001s)]
*  So my question to you is, what's the sentiment there, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=748.36s)]
*  as well as with your contacts, of how long this pause will [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=752.4000000000001s)]
*  be in effect? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=756.2s)]
*  And hopefully, the vigilance that needs to be maintained [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=757.0s)]
*  by the United States and our allies in anticipation [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=762.32s)]
*  of further October 7th? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=765.32s)]
*  Yeah, without getting too deep in the weeds here, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=768.88s)]
*  I want to just give you a sense of what [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=770.8000000000001s)]
*  the situation on the ground looks like now. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=773.32s)]
*  The Israelis are not in control of the Gaza Strip. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=776.08s)]
*  They currently are in the Nitsarim corridor [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=779.2s)]
*  that cuts through the northern part of Gaza [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=781.44s)]
*  and the Philadelphia corridor in the south. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=783.7600000000001s)]
*  As part of this agreement, they will [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=786.08s)]
*  withdraw from those key corridors, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=787.48s)]
*  and they will lose the ability to conduct limited raids [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=789.8000000000001s)]
*  from inside Gaza against cells of remaining Hamas [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=793.08s)]
*  and Islamic Jihad fighters. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=796.1600000000001s)]
*  As we look forward, though, in the region, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=797.94s)]
*  there are real questions about who [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=800.36s)]
*  will be in control of the Gaza Strip, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=802.12s)]
*  because you have a domestic situation for Israeli Prime [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=804.24s)]
*  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that is quite serious. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=807.76s)]
*  There are current members of the far-right coalition [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=810.36s)]
*  here that are holding this government together [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=813.28s)]
*  and keeping the prime minister in power that threatened [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=815.52s)]
*  to leave the coalition if a ceasefire agreement went [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=818.24s)]
*  into effect, if a deal was signed, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=821.5600000000001s)]
*  like we are reporting tonight. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=823.22s)]
*  And according to initial reports in Israeli media, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=825.4s)]
*  there was some horse trading behind the scenes [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=829.12s)]
*  with these ministers basically to say, look, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=830.8s)]
*  we'll get some of the living hostages out of Gaza, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=833.28s)]
*  but the war will not end. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=835.4s)]
*  And so what that means is that some hostages could still [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=837.24s)]
*  be inside Gaza if fighting resumes. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=839.84s)]
*  And also, it's a clear indication [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=842.6s)]
*  that the prime minister will have [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=844.6800000000001s)]
*  to consider some of these ministers [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=846.32s)]
*  if he wants to stay in power and he doesn't want [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=848.76s)]
*  the government to collapse. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=850.52s)]
*  So it's an incredibly difficult domestic situation. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=851.64s)]
*  But then you have this broader issue of Hamas and Islamic [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=854.6s)]
*  jihad cells, not just in the Gaza Strip, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=857.48s)]
*  but also in places like the West Bank, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=859.9200000000001s)]
*  where overnight the Israelis conducted a drone strike [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=861.8000000000001s)]
*  against the Hamas cell from the Al-Qassam Brigades there. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=864.6s)]
*  And so this is an ongoing conflict [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=868.4200000000001s)]
*  that certainly is not over. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=870.4000000000001s)]
*  The war will continue in some capacity, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=872.48s)]
*  even if it is not inside Gaza. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=874.6400000000001s)]
*  I need to step in real quickly. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=876.1600000000001s)]
*  And I thank you for all of that detail [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=877.5600000000001s)]
*  and answer to the question that you were asked. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=880.36s)]
*  Some of that is why they need at least 16 more days [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=882.2s)]
*  for phase two, I would imagine. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=884.72s)]
*  And you're laying it out beautifully. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=886.4000000000001s)]
*  What everybody is looking at on the left side [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=887.6800000000001s)]
*  of their screen right now is a live look at Tel Aviv. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=889.98s)]
*  Remember, I was telling you about these demonstrations [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=892.7600000000001s)]
*  that really began last night. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=895.6800000000001s)]
*  I mean, they're a few hours ahead of us. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=897.0600000000001s)]
*  So many of them may have already gotten [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=899.5600000000001s)]
*  a rather imminent feeling that something was coming. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=902.48s)]
*  Well, they're in full strength. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=906.32s)]
*  Can we hear any of this with what we're bringing in [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=907.6s)]
*  via satellite? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=911.6800000000001s)]
*  Okay, let's listen. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=914.7600000000001s)]
*  One more time. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=916.32s)]
*  And again, this violence is really intense. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=917.5600000000001s)]
*  WeIREFULF! [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=920.58s)]
*  I go to the synagogues, the [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=924.4200000000001s)]
*  müsst siz. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=930.5600000000001s)]
*  All of them! [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=931.94s)]
*  Those in life and those who are not. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=933.72s)]
*  We want everyone to die. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=936.0200000000001s)]
*  everyone. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=937.96s)]
*  Everyone, at one strike! [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=939.0400000000001s)]
*  To turn the tide of power, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=942.5s)]
*  Ok, cue the outline! [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=944.1s)]
*  for the deal that would free hostages. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=945.86s)]
*  And, you know, obviously some of this is in Hebrew, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=949.66s)]
*  so we can't understand all of it. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=952.32s)]
*  I want to bring Trey Yanks back in. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=953.82s)]
*  So Trey, and I also want to welcome our guest, Darren Gob, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=955.86s)]
*  who is a geopolitical strategist, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=959.36s)]
*  or former Black Hawk, helicopter pilot, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=961.2s)]
*  and battalion commander. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=963.64s)]
*  Trey, just real quickly tell me what's playing out. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=965.28s)]
*  And it can't just be in Tel Aviv. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=968.5600000000001s)]
*  What I was watching last night [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=970.08s)]
*  were in several places all across the country, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=971.76s)]
*  welcoming this idea of getting the hostages back. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=974.34s)]
*  This is just part one. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=977.32s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=980.98s)]
*  These demonstrators are on Beggin Street in Tel Aviv, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=981.82s)]
*  Israel's second largest city. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=984.5s)]
*  They are demonstrating outside of the Kiriah, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=986.0200000000001s)]
*  Israel's version of the Pentagon. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=988.6600000000001s)]
*  They've been meeting there for the past 15 months, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=990.38s)]
*  demanding the release of these hostages. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=993.34s)]
*  And we've been there in Hostage Square, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=995.8000000000001s)]
*  very close to here, speaking with them. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=997.6800000000001s)]
*  And they note that the hostages [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=999.62s)]
*  that are going to be released as part of this deal [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=1001.1s)]
*  have been held for almost 500 days. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=1003.36s)]
*  Remember the first agreement back in November of 2023, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=1005.5600000000001s)]
*  into December of 2023, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=1009.32s)]
*  it was around 50 days that those hostages had been held. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=1011.2800000000001s)]
*  So nearly 10 times the amount of time [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=1014.1600000000001s)]
*  inside the Gaza Strip. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=1016.76s)]
*  And I interviewed some of those people [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=1018.1600000000001s)]
*  who were released from Hamas captivity. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=1020.0400000000001s)]
*  And the stories that they told [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=1022.4s)]
*  from the tunnels inside Gaza were horrific. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=1024.04s)]
*  Things of sexual violence, assault, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=1027.16s)]
*  threatening these hostages with executions. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=1030.2s)]
*  And so you just think these people [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=1034.14s)]
*  who have been inside Gaza for nearly 500 days, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=1034.98s)]
*  what they must have gone through [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=1037.3s)]
*  during this horrific experience. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=1038.7s)]
*  Look, we know from some who've come home, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=1040.42s)]
*  I know I personally have spent time with the parents [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=1042.3s)]
*  of Omar who lived out on Long Island. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=1045.78s)]
*  And we recently got the message [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=1048.42s)]
*  that he did not make it, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=1050.18s)]
*  a young man who had just joined the Israeli army [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=1051.22s)]
*  to help out before he continued on to college [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNgW1gOVJs&t=1054.92s)]
