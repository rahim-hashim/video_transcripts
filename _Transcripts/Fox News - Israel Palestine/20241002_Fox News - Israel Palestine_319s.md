# Shocking video shows Hezbollah weapons cache hidden under child's bedroom
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o)
*  The United Nations Security Council just met on Iran's unprecedented attack against Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=0.0s)]
*  And joining us now is Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Deneune, who [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=7.18s)]
*  was at that meeting. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=10.8s)]
*  Ambassador Deneune, while you were speaking, while you were in this meeting, we heard from [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=13.24s)]
*  our commander in chief, President Biden, at Joint Base Andrews on this conflict. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=16.56s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=20.72s)]
*  Can you tell us anything about Iran and Israel's possible... [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=21.72s)]
*  Yes, look. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=26.72s)]
*  I called a meeting of the G7 today. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=28.72s)]
*  We're working on a joint statement all of us agree on, from Japan to France to Germany [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=31.72s)]
*  to et cetera. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=38.72s)]
*  And what we're doing in that regard is we're making it clear that there are things that [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=39.72s)]
*  have to be done. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=46.72s)]
*  And it's obviously Iran has gone way out of, I mean, has way off work. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=47.72s)]
*  We're going to put together a joint statement that hasn't been done yet. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=53.72s)]
*  It will be done before too long, probably by the time we land. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=58.72s)]
*  And there's going to be some sanctions imposed on Iran. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=62.72s)]
*  Ambassador Deneune, President Biden previously said that we must fully, fully support Israel. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=67.72s)]
*  Do you feel that you have the support of the United States this hour? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=71.72s)]
*  What happened last night was unprecedented. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=75.72s)]
*  The attack against Israel, 200 ballistic missiles. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=79.72s)]
*  We will retaliate. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=83.72s)]
*  We will not wait for anyone else. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=84.72s)]
*  It will be painful for Iran. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=86.72s)]
*  I said it very clearly in the Security Council. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=88.72s)]
*  I told the Iranian ambassador, you will pay a price for what you did. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=90.72s)]
*  And I think it's important that the U.S. and other democracies will also impose sanctions, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=94.72s)]
*  crippling sanctions against Iran. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=101.72s)]
*  Because today they have so much money to spend on their proxies. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=103.72s)]
*  And we see the results. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=106.72s)]
*  We are being attacked from all fronts, from Lebanon, from Gaza, from Yemen, from Iran. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=108.72s)]
*  And it's an attack not only against Israel, it's an attack against Western civilizations. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=114.72s)]
*  The United Nations Secretary General made some really eyebrow raising remarks before you spoke. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=120.72s)]
*  I want to play those. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=126.72s)]
*  But since October, exchanges of fire have expanded in scope, depth and intensity. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=127.72s)]
*  I stated that almost daily exchanges of fire by Hezbollah and other non-state armed groups in Lebanon [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=135.72s)]
*  and the Israel Defense Forces are in repeated violation of Security Council Resolution 1701. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=144.72s)]
*  You know, I'm looking at your face there. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=154.72s)]
*  That is the head of the U.N. putting Hezbollah on the same moral plateau as the IDF. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=156.72s)]
*  The day after, and I want to play this for our viewers, your Israeli Defense Forces found a tunnel in Hezbollah [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=163.72s)]
*  beneath a child's bedroom with a cache of weapons underneath and a plan to commit October 7th from the north. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=170.72s)]
*  What do you think when you hear the head of the U.N. equivocate your country to Hezbollah? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=177.72s)]
*  That's shameful. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=183.72s)]
*  And it's not the first time since October 7th, the Secretary General and other officials here at the U.N. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=185.72s)]
*  that make the moral equation between the aggressor and us, we are defending ourselves. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=191.72s)]
*  And even last night after the attack from Iran, the Secretary General couldn't even mention Iran in his statement. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=197.72s)]
*  He called for de-escalation. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=204.72s)]
*  Like you have two equal sides playing a game. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=206.72s)]
*  That's unacceptable. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=210.72s)]
*  You know, imagine that, you know, during World War II, while the Allies fought Nazi Germany, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=212.72s)]
*  the U.N. would have called for both sides to de-escalate. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=217.72s)]
*  The U.N. was not in place back then, but it was formed exactly in order to avoid such scenarios. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=221.72s)]
*  And we see today that when you have a crisis, instead of standing with the side that is defending itself, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=227.72s)]
*  the U.N. is doing exactly the opposite. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=233.72s)]
*  They criticize us, the one who are defending our people, but we are strong. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=235.72s)]
*  You know, Kelly, tonight we're going to celebrate the Jewish New Year, Rosh Hashanah. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=240.72s)]
*  It has been a very tough year for us. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=244.72s)]
*  We are in deep pain, but we are strong. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=246.72s)]
*  We are determined and we will win. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=248.72s)]
*  We will make sure that Iran will pay a price and we have shown our capabilities already in Gaza and in Lebanon. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=250.72s)]
*  Yes. Well, final question to you. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=258.72s)]
*  And it is pretty incredible. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=259.72s)]
*  The largest ballistic missile attack in history and the head of the U.N. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=260.72s)]
*  fails to condemn Iran in his paper statement. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=263.72s)]
*  Last question, that terror attack that happened yesterday that left a beautiful mother dead as she was shielding her nine month old. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=266.72s)]
*  Any indication as to who was behind that? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=273.72s)]
*  Yes, Hamas took responsibility. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=277.72s)]
*  We are still checking if there was coordination between Hamas and Iran because, you know, minutes after this massacre, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=280.72s)]
*  the rockets flew into Israel. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=287.72s)]
*  So I think there was a connection, but we are looking into that. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=289.72s)]
*  But you mentioned that story, but we have other stories. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=292.72s)]
*  Seven Israelis were massacred in the streets of Tel Aviv. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=295.72s)]
*  That's painful. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=300.72s)]
*  And we are fighting in on front. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=302.72s)]
*  Israel is under attack, but we are strong. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=304.72s)]
*  We are resilient and we will win this war. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=306.72s)]
*  We have no choice. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=309.72s)]
*  I will tell you, my family prays for little Kofir and Ariel Bevis every single night. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=310.72s)]
*  We pray for the release of those hostages, the safety of Israel. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=314.72s)]
*  Thank you, Ambassador. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o&t=317.72s)]
