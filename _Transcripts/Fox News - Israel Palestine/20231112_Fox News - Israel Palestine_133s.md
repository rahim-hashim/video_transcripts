# Mark Levin: Why is the New York Times still in business?
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97xhZV-UG0)
*  Welcome back America, the contemptible New York Times and other media in this country. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97xhZV-UG0&t=0.0s)]
*  You would think today of all days, this month of all months, given their own history, that [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97xhZV-UG0&t=9.6s)]
*  they would be extremely careful in how they're reporting what's going on in the Middle East, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97xhZV-UG0&t=17.12s)]
*  but it hasn't changed. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97xhZV-UG0&t=20.64s)]
*  No single explanation seems to suffice for what was surely the century's bitterest journalistic [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97xhZV-UG0&t=22.28s)]
*  failure. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97xhZV-UG0&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  The Times, like most media of that era, fervently embraced the wartime policies of the American [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97xhZV-UG0&t=29.78s)]
*  and British governments, as do the media today, both of which strongly resisted proposals [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97xhZV-UG0&t=34.5s)]
*  to rescue Jews that would offer them haven. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97xhZV-UG0&t=40.06s)]
*  After a decade of economic depression, both governments had political reasons to discourage [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97xhZV-UG0&t=43.3s)]
*  immigration and diplomatic reasons to refuse Jewish settlements in regions like Palestine. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97xhZV-UG0&t=47.46s)]
*  But again, Professor Leff, she writes, you could have read the front page of the New [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97xhZV-UG0&t=54.34s)]
*  York Times in 1939 and 49 without knowing that millions of Jews were being sent in Poland, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97xhZV-UG0&t=58.98s)]
*  imprisoned in ghettos and dying of disease and starvation by the thousands. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97xhZV-UG0&t=65.97999999999999s)]
*  You could have read the front page in 1942 and not have known until the last month that [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97xhZV-UG0&t=70.28s)]
*  the Germans were carrying out a plan to annihilate European Jews. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97xhZV-UG0&t=74.06s)]
*  In 1943, you could have been told once that Jews from France, Belgium and the Netherlands [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97xhZV-UG0&t=77.94s)]
*  were being sent to slaughterhouses in Poland, and that more than half of the Jews in Europe [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97xhZV-UG0&t=82.17999999999999s)]
*  were now dead, but only in the context of a single story on a rally by Jewish groups [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97xhZV-UG0&t=86.68s)]
*  that devoted more space to who had spoken than to who had died. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97xhZV-UG0&t=91.28s)]
*  In 1944, you would have learned from the front page of the existence of horrible places such [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97xhZV-UG0&t=95.2s)]
*  as Medinik and Auschwitz, but only inside the paper could you find that the victims [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97xhZV-UG0&t=100.48s)]
*  were Jews. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97xhZV-UG0&t=105.28s)]
*  In 1945, liberated dachau in Buchenwald were on the front page, but the Jews were buried [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97xhZV-UG0&t=106.56s)]
*  inside. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97xhZV-UG0&t=112.44000000000001s)]
*  And of course, they were already slaughtered. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97xhZV-UG0&t=113.44000000000001s)]
*  The New York Times Corporation, why is it still in business? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97xhZV-UG0&t=116.56s)]
*  Eats me. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97xhZV-UG0&t=119.84s)]
