# Former Trump official rips Blinken's 'unfortunate statement' on Israel
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw)
*  Bring in Robert O'Brien, former National Security Advisor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=0.0s)]
*  to President Trump. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=2.54s)]
*  Want to ask you about a couple of things. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=3.24s)]
*  First of all, would you agree that one of the reasons Hamas [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=5.0s)]
*  came to the table to start releasing hostages [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=8.42s)]
*  is because of the military pressure [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=10.74s)]
*  that Israel put on Hamas in the Gaza Strip, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=13.08s)]
*  especially in the north, as they closed in on that hospital? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=16.82s)]
*  Dana, you're absolutely right. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=21.22s)]
*  I had some experience dealing with Hamas [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=22.3s)]
*  when I was the hostage envoy before becoming [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=23.98s)]
*  National Security Advisor. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=26.1s)]
*  We were trying to get an Israeli hostage, the remains [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=27.64s)]
*  of an Israeli hostage, Hayden Golder, an IDF soldier who'd [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=30.92s)]
*  been taken by Hamas, dragged through the tunnels [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  and taken into Gaza. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=37.1s)]
*  And they held his remains for years [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=39.04s)]
*  to keep his parents from being able to bury him in Israel. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=40.68s)]
*  And without military pressure, there's [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=43.64s)]
*  going to be no action on Hamas' side. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=46.040000000000006s)]
*  With the military pressure, you saw that almost 100 hostages [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=49.2s)]
*  were released. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=52.44s)]
*  So I think Hamas realized that they [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  were losing their leverage as the more hostages came [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=55.44s)]
*  out, the leverage they had to stop the war on Hamas [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=57.6s)]
*  and the extermination of the terrorists was waning. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=63.58s)]
*  And so they put a pause to it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=66.82000000000001s)]
*  So the ceasefire has expired. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=69.06s)]
*  I want to ask you about this. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=71.18s)]
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=72.3s)]
*  was in Tel Aviv yesterday. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=73.9s)]
*  He met with the Israeli defense minister [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=76.86s)]
*  and reportedly told the defense minister [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=78.98s)]
*  about the stated goal to dismantle Hamas, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=81.82s)]
*  even if it takes months, told him this. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=84.3s)]
*  I don't think you have the credit for that. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=86.88s)]
*  Noah Rothman at National Review wrote this. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=89.68s)]
*  Israel, you're on your own. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=91.6s)]
*  Credit. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=94.0s)]
*  Dwell on that word. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=94.76s)]
*  If the Israeli government apparently [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=96.88s)]
*  acquired metaphorical capital following [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=98.54s)]
*  the slaughter of more than 1,300 innocents in the most gruesome [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=100.44s)]
*  fashion imaginable, but that account [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=104.28s)]
*  is approaching overdrawn status, how ghoulish. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=106.56s)]
*  If Israel fights this war with the speed the White House wants, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=110.12s)]
*  it would be a quick campaign, but not a clean one. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=113.3s)]
*  What do you think about the idea of Israel [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=117.17999999999999s)]
*  not having credit in order to get Hamas eliminated? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=119.17999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, this is another one where it's just [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=124.24s)]
*  an unfortunate statement by Tony Blinken. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=126.17999999999999s)]
*  I'm sure he wishes he could do it over and take it back. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=128.01999999999998s)]
*  But the idea is that America's only going to back Israel [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=130.9s)]
*  for a certain amount of time. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=133.82s)]
*  And that's been the case with Democrat administrations [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=134.94s)]
*  in the past, with the Obama administration [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=137.62s)]
*  and the past Gaza incursion, that we give Israel [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=140.18s)]
*  a little bit of time to get a few terrorists, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=142.66s)]
*  but not let them take care of the job and finish it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=144.88s)]
*  Israel's going to finish the job here. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=147.88s)]
*  Hamas has to be destroyed. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=149.44s)]
*  And that's not just for Israel. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=150.84s)]
*  That's for America. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  That's for, I mean, Hamas is holding American hostages. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=152.88s)]
*  And we're talking about Israel not having credit. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=156.48s)]
*  You know, if this was Ronald Reagan, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=158.92s)]
*  Bill Hemmers out at the Reagan Library Museum, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  and I'm going to be with him tomorrow night, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=162.6s)]
*  getting interviewed by Bill and Liam Panetta and Stephen [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=164.51999999999998s)]
*  Hadley and looking forward to it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=166.76s)]
*  But Ronald Reagan talking about terrorists, you can run, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=168.56s)]
*  but you can't hide. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=170.6s)]
*  Where's that kind of attitude with Hamas? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=172.02s)]
*  They killed Americans and took Americans hostage. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=174.38s)]
*  Instead, we're putting the handcuffs on Israel. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=176.62s)]
*  That's a very bad idea. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=178.42s)]
*  It sends a wrong message to the terrorists, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=179.94s)]
*  and it sends a wrong message to our allies. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=181.54s)]
*  I mean, how do the Taiwanese and the Ukrainians [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=183.62s)]
*  feel when they hear that Israel's only got a few days [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=186.1s)]
*  to, quote, credit to defend themselves [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=189.3s)]
*  when they're defending themselves [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=193.38s)]
*  against Russia and China? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=194.3s)]
*  So bad message to our allies, bad message to our adversaries, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=195.38s)]
*  and I'm sure Secretary Blinken wishes [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=199.02s)]
*  he had a do-over on that one. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=201.28s)]
*  A quick comment, if you would, based on your experience, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=202.48s)]
*  your assessment of what you think is going on [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=205.16s)]
*  with the rest of the hostages. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=207.52s)]
*  Well, our thoughts and prayers go out to them [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=211.02s)]
*  and their families because they're being held [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=213.52s)]
*  under terrible conditions. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=215.24s)]
*  That's starting to come out with the interviews [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=216.4s)]
*  of the hostages who've been released. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=218.16s)]
*  They're in cages, they're in tunnels, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=219.94s)]
*  they're being harassed by Hamas, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=221.4s)]
*  and Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=224.44s)]
*  is coming and talking to the hostages in Hebrew, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=227.32s)]
*  which he learned in an Israeli jail. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=229.22s)]
*  When he was held on a life prison term, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=231.61999999999998s)]
*  it was exchanged for an Israeli hostage. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=233.94s)]
*  So it's a tough situation for them. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=236.57999999999998s)]
*  I think the more pressure the Israelis put on them, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=238.7s)]
*  the more pressure there's gonna be on Hamas [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=240.42s)]
*  to release these hostages, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=242.66s)]
*  and hopefully our friends in Qatar and other places [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=244.38s)]
*  will intervene to help get these guys out, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=247.01999999999998s)]
*  but it's a really rough situation for them. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=249.26s)]
*  Robert O'Brien, thank you for being with us this morning. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=251.78s)]
*  Thank you, Dana. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQRig-l_gjw&t=254.94s)]
