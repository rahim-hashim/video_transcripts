# Mark Levin: The American media is covering this up
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0)
*  some background that I'm sure you haven't heard anywhere else. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=0.0s)]
*  I do a lot of research for this show as you well know. I don't want you to waste [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=4.08s)]
*  your time. I don't want you to waste your hour. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  There's other things you can do. I'm well aware of that. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=9.6s)]
*  And so when you come here I want to make sure that I provide you with some [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=12.32s)]
*  information that you can take away. I've read two books that I want to [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=15.76s)]
*  bring to your attention that hits this subject. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=20.64s)]
*  Professor Stephen Norwood wrote a book, The Third Reich in the Ivory Tower, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=22.72s)]
*  for complicity and conflict on American campuses. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=26.48s)]
*  Bradley Hart wrote a book, Hitler's American Friends, the Third Reich [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  supporters in the United States. I want you to listen to some of this. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=34.16s)]
*  It's very important. Obviously I can't read [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=37.84s)]
*  all the books and many of you are not going to get the books. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=39.84s)]
*  But let me give you a taste of what's in here in this chapter called The Students [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=44.24s)]
*  in Hitler's American Friends. It says in part, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=48.32s)]
*  American universities did little to curtail the influence of pro-German [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=51.28s)]
*  speakers on campus. Throughout the decade German exchange [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=55.36s)]
*  students, some of whom were Nazi party members and were likely operating as [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=59.28s)]
*  propaganda agents and other speakers were given mostly [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=63.04s)]
*  unchallenged platforms on university campuses. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=66.4s)]
*  American universities therefore offered the German government a remarkable level [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=70.24s)]
*  of establishment legitimacy in the United States. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=74.64s)]
*  Even after the violently anti-Semitic nature of the regime had become clear, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=78.0s)]
*  just as Hitler's corporate friends had shown little reluctance doing business [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=84.08s)]
*  with the Reich, his friends in academia maintained their own [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=88.16s)]
*  relationships with the Reich. Both the Nazis and US [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=91.2s)]
*  government were aware of the propaganda potential provided by [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=94.56s)]
*  American universities. Testifying before the DICE committee, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=98.08s)]
*  John C. Metcalf argued that the German government had a particular interest in [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=102.4s)]
*  American students. The purpose of the exchange students to [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  universities has long been to foster goodwill and peace among the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=109.92s)]
*  nations. The result is greater understanding, he [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=113.68s)]
*  testified, but this worthwhile aim has been neglected in the exchange of [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=116.72000000000001s)]
*  German students for American. Now American students are being indoctrinated [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=121.28s)]
*  with the aims of fascism in Germany both abroad and at home [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=125.92s)]
*  to the detriment of democratic institutions in America. This is the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=130.08s)]
*  1930s and 40s on American campuses like Harvard, like the University of [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=133.28s)]
*  Virginia, like Columbia, like so many of them. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=139.12s)]
*  He goes on, around the country students and faculty alike [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=144.4s)]
*  increasingly became embroiled in unfolding international tensions [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  as the 1930s progressed. Most often it was the vocally anti-Nazi professors, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  some of whom were themselves Jewish refugees from Nazi oppression, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=158.8s)]
*  who faced the brunt of administrative repression. At one point it was even [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=162.8s)]
*  rumored that the German council general in New Orleans was offering cash [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=166.72s)]
*  to universities that dismissed anti-Nazi professors. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=170.72s)]
*  Look at all the foreign cash flowing into our universities from Islamist [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=174.72s)]
*  organizations and front groups in this country, the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=178.16s)]
*  Confucius Institutes, just keep what's going on in America today [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=181.76s)]
*  in mind when I tell you what was going on during the Third Reich. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=186.96s)]
*  The same was much less often the case for openly pro-Nazi professors, unless [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=191.6s)]
*  student or public pressure demanded action. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=196.24s)]
*  There were apparently no sanctions leveled. For instance, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=199.04000000000002s)]
*  with University of Idaho mechanical engineering department head [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=202.32000000000002s)]
*  Henry Gause traveled to a controversial Guttgenheim [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=206.16s)]
*  university celebration in 1937, declared himself to be the representative of [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=209.84s)]
*  American universities west of the Mississippi, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=214.72s)]
*  despite having no official remit to do so, and then gave quote the Hitler salute [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=217.44s)]
*  to the rector. He remained department head until 1952, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=222.88s)]
*  and a building on campus bears his name today. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=227.68s)]
*  Faculty members and administrators could have made a major impact by denouncing [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=230.72s)]
*  the open prejudice of Nazism and protecting descending voices. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=235.04s)]
*  Too often they let their students down by failing to do so. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=239.2s)]
*  It goes on in part, the campus conflicts were directly fed [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=243.2s)]
*  by the surprising degree to which American universities and faculty [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=248.4s)]
*  members remain willing to send their students [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=251.92s)]
*  to study in the Third Reich, even after the anti-Semitic and violent nature of [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=254.23999999999998s)]
*  Nazism were clear. Read all about it. Hitler's [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=259.36s)]
*  American friends. You've not heard about it anywhere else in this country. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=262.8s)]
*  But history does repeat itself, and it's repeating itself today in American [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=266.88s)]
*  universities and in the American media. One more, the Third Reich in the ivory [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=270.32s)]
*  tower by Professor Stephen Norwood, complicity and conflict on the [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=275.2s)]
*  American campus. Here is the table of contents in part. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=279.36s)]
*  Legitimizing Nazism, Harvard University and the Hitler regime, 1933 to 37. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=284.56s)]
*  Complicity and conflict, Columbia University's response to fashions of [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=290.72s)]
*  1933 to 37. The Seven Sisters colleges in the Third [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=294.56s)]
*  Reich promoting fellowship through student exchange. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=299.28000000000003s)]
*  A respectful hearing for Nazi Germany's apologists, the University of Virginia [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=302.88s)]
*  Institute of Public Affairs round tables, 1933 to 41. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=307.28s)]
*  Nazi nests, German departments in American universities, 1933 [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=312.79999999999995s)]
*  to 1941. Let's get into this a little bit more. It's relevant, it's crucially [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=317.84s)]
*  important, it provides context. He writes in part, the Harvard [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=322.4s)]
*  University administration during the 1930s, led by President James Brian [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=327.11999999999995s)]
*  Connaught, ignored numerous opportunities to take a [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=331.44s)]
*  principled stand against the Hitler regime and its anti-Semitic outrages and [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=334.64s)]
*  contributed to Nazi Germany's efforts to improve its image in the West. Sound [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=339.84s)]
*  familiar? Its lack of concern about Nazi anti-Semitism was shared by many [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=343.52s)]
*  influential Harvard alumni and student leaders in warmly welcoming [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=349.2s)]
*  Nazi leaders to the Harvard campus, inviting them to prestigious high-profile [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=354.08s)]
*  social events and striving to build friendly relations [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=358.56s)]
*  with thoroughly Nazified universities in Germany [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=362.24s)]
*  while denouncing those who protested against these actions. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=365.68s)]
*  Harvard's administration and many of its student leaders [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=369.44s)]
*  offered important encouragement to the Hitler regime [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=372.8s)]
*  as it intensified its persecution of Jews and expanded its military strength. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=375.92s)]
*  You can see why I dug into the research and pulled this out for you. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=381.36s)]
*  It's crucially important. The few scholars who previously addressed this [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=385.68s)]
*  subject devoted insufficient attention to [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=389.68s)]
*  anti-Semitism in the Harvard administration [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=392.32s)]
*  and student body and underestimated the university's complicity [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=394.96s)]
*  in the Nazis' persecution of the Jews. Listen to this stuff. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=399.36s)]
*  From 1933 when Connaught assumed the presidency of America's oldest and most [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=402.96000000000004s)]
*  prestigious university, Harvard, through 1937, Connaught failed to speak [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=408.08s)]
*  out against Nazism on many occasions when it really mattered. He was [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=413.12s)]
*  publicly silent during the visit of the Nazi warship Karlsruhe to Boston in May [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=416.88s)]
*  1934, some of whose crew Harvard entertained. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=421.36s)]
*  He welcomed the high Nazi official Ernst Potsy Hengitzkow [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=425.6s)]
*  to the June 1934 Harvard commencement. In March 1935, the Harvard administration [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=429.76s)]
*  permitted Nazi Germany's council general in Boston [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=436.56s)]
*  to place a wreath bearing the swastika emblem in the university chapel, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=439.52s)]
*  Connaught sent a delegate from Harvard to the University of Heidelberg's 550th [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=444.0s)]
*  anniversary pageant in June 1936, and he extended warm [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=448.48s)]
*  greetings to George August University in Göttingen [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=452.96000000000004s)]
*  on its 200th anniversary in June 1937. In providing a friendly welcome to Nazi [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=457.28000000000003s)]
*  leader Haschdingerl, President Connaught and others [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=463.52000000000004s)]
*  prominently affiliated with Harvard communicated to the Hitler government [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=467.68s)]
*  that boycotts intended to destroy Jewish businesses, the dismissal of Jews from the [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=472.08s)]
*  professions and savage beating of Jews were not their concern. And you know what, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=476.96s)]
*  ladies and gentlemen? These administrators who testified [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=481.84s)]
*  before the Republican majority House Education Committee sound the same damn [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=486.71999999999997s)]
*  way. These universities are doing the same thing [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=493.52s)]
*  with the Islamists, with the Hamas front groups, CARE, and their network in the United States, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=497.52000000000004s)]
*  through their faculty and tenure, through their admissions processes, our country, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=504.64000000000004s)]
*  through the student visa process, which is completely out of control and unmonitored, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=510.96000000000004s)]
*  unvetted people coming into the country, coming into our classrooms, coming into our schools, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=516.88s)]
*  coming into our society, in the ivory towers of Harvard, University of Pennsylvania, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=521.68s)]
*  MIT, and elsewhere, and of course, as I've discussed before on the show, all supported [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=530.7199999999999s)]
*  by the media, by the New York Times, by the Washington Post in the 1930s and 40s and today, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=538.8s)]
*  the abandonment of the Jews, it's all right here, by the American media, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=546.96s)]
*  buried by the Times, it's all right here, by the American media, beyond belief, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=554.72s)]
*  all right here about the American media, college campuses, the American media, the propaganda, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=561.6s)]
*  the defense of anti-Semitism, the covering up of anti-Semitism, the covering up of Jew hatred, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=568.56s)]
*  attacks on Jews, and extermination. Where do you see this in one form or another, or one degree [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=576.88s)]
*  or another? You see it on MSNBC and CNN, you see it in today's Washington Times and Washington Post. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=584.72s)]
*  Where do you see this on the campuses? In over 200 American campuses, you see it in the streets, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=590.64s)]
*  you see it with the professors who are outspoken, you see it with the student groups, you see it with [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=597.76s)]
*  the students, you see it with their posters and their flags, you see it all. There's a whiff of [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=601.6s)]
*  the 1930s and 40s in the air. It is a stench. It is covering our country in a dark cloud. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=609.2800000000001s)]
*  The Democrat Party is part of it, just as the Democrat Party was part of it in the 1930s and [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=618.0s)]
*  40s under Franklin Roosevelt, refused to bomb the rail lines into Auschwitz, refused to allow Jews [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=622.96s)]
*  trying to escape sure extermination in Europe from coming to the United States. And the list goes on [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=630.72s)]
*  and on and on. Bernie Sanders trashing Israel, Rashida Tlaib trashing Israel, resolutions to [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=637.2800000000001s)]
*  condemn anti-Semitism. Half the Democrats in the House vote against it. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=648.32s)]
*  You have individuals in our media who are effectively spokesmen for Hamas and Intifada [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=653.6800000000001s)]
*  and anti-Semitism, and then they cloak themselves in free speech and academic freedom. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=660.88s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, it was once said by a great Supreme Court justice that the Constitution is [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=667.12s)]
*  not a suicide pact. We hear over and over again when it comes to Donald Trump that free speech [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=674.64s)]
*  has its limits. But apparently, if you're a Jew-hating anti-Semite at a poison ivy lake college, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=681.04s)]
*  or you're a host or a guest in one of these corrupt news media platforms, apparently you're [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=689.68s)]
*  free to say whatever the hell you want to say. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDt8vv9UTZ0&t=697.36s)]
