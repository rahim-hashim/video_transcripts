# Hamas did not keep up its end on hostages: Senior Adviser to Israel’s PM
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY)
*  Now we get a view from Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=0.0s)]
*  Mark is back with us. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=1.8s)]
*  He's an advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=3.14s)]
*  Mark, it's always good having you. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=5.9s)]
*  I always feel bad under these circumstances. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=7.48s)]
*  But I did want to pick your brain a little bit about this [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=9.96s)]
*  behind the scenes, maybe tension between Anthony Blinken, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=12.36s)]
*  our Secretary of State, some of your leaders over the US [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=15.84s)]
*  recommending go slow on this response in Gaza. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=20.52s)]
*  What can you tell us? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=24.0s)]
*  Well, let's be frank. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  I think Israel and the United States see eye to eye [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=28.84s)]
*  on a host of important issues. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=30.96s)]
*  Once again, we both believe that Hamas can no longer stay [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=33.84s)]
*  in power in the Gaza Strip, that they have to be removed [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=37.72s)]
*  from their control. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=40.4s)]
*  Two, that the reason that the humanitarian pause ended [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=42.2s)]
*  was because Hamas didn't act according to its own commitments [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  to release hostages. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=49.04s)]
*  Three, that there has to be created a new situation [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=50.8s)]
*  in the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=53.96s)]
*  And four, that in pursuing these goals, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=54.96s)]
*  we have to make a maximum effort to avoid seeing civilians [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=57.48s)]
*  caught up in the crossfire between the Israeli Defense [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=61.32s)]
*  Forces and the Hamas terrorists. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  And on all that, we agree. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=66.16s)]
*  Maybe so. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=68.96s)]
*  And I'm maybe reading too much to what were talks [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=69.56s)]
*  of heated discussions. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=72.2s)]
*  And that some of your colleagues were getting annoyed [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=73.68s)]
*  that the administration was kind of lecturing you on this. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  And that some of you felt the need to go your own way, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=81.68s)]
*  even if the United States is saying you're going too far. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=86.72000000000001s)]
*  What happened there? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=89.80000000000001s)]
*  And is there a sense that Israel, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=91.48s)]
*  even if the United States were to say, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=93.28s)]
*  go slow or watch this response or push another truce, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=96.16000000000001s)]
*  it would be the first time we've seen Israel [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=100.64000000000001s)]
*  do something like that in our long multi-decade relationship. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=102.84s)]
*  So I was in those meetings with the Secretary of State. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=107.72s)]
*  And I can tell you, no one was lecturing anyone. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=111.32000000000001s)]
*  We were sharing views on how we think the best way to proceed [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=114.12s)]
*  is we can have here and there, we see things not identically. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=118.64s)]
*  That's only natural between friends. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=123.84s)]
*  Obviously, anything the United States says, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=125.4s)]
*  we take very, very seriously. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=127.12s)]
*  And I think they take very seriously [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=128.88s)]
*  whatever we say to them. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=130.4s)]
*  But we will pursue this campaign against Hamas. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=132.56s)]
*  Hamas will be destroyed. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=135.0s)]
*  But in parallel now to the military operation, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=137.04s)]
*  we will be working with the Americans and others [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=140.51999999999998s)]
*  to take steps first of all, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=144.04s)]
*  to make sure that humanitarian aid comes in [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  for the civilian population. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  That's our commitment. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=149.56s)]
*  That's part of our ethos. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=150.76s)]
*  That's who we are. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=151.88s)]
*  We don't wanna see unnecessary civilian hardship. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=152.72s)]
*  And of course, we will continue to differentiate. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=156.23999999999998s)]
*  We're a democratic country. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=159.16s)]
*  We work according to the rules of war. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=160.39999999999998s)]
*  We will continue to differentiate between civilians [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=162.6s)]
*  who are not the target of our operation [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=166.83999999999997s)]
*  and the brutal Hamas terrorists who are our vicious enemy [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=169.2s)]
*  and we will destroy them. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  So when we got word this morning, Mark, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=174.28s)]
*  that Israel pulled out of these talks [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=177.88s)]
*  to get another truce possibly going and cut her. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  What happened? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=183.88s)]
*  So the talks were at an impasse [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=186.67999999999998s)]
*  because Hamas had not fulfilled its own commitments. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=189.64s)]
*  There was an agreed list [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=194.64s)]
*  that Hamas had once again signed off on [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=196.44s)]
*  and suddenly they couldn't deliver or they wouldn't deliver. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=198.72s)]
*  And we don't wanna just talk for the sake of talking. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=201.88s)]
*  Our goal was to get our people out. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=204.4s)]
*  The truth is had Hamas continued to release hostages, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=207.6s)]
*  we would still be in a pause now. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=212.76000000000002s)]
*  We've only returned to combat [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=214.6s)]
*  because Hamas refused to follow through [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=216.04000000000002s)]
*  on a list that it itself agreed to. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=219.44s)]
*  So we're back in combat and we actually think [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=222.08s)]
*  by beefing up the military pressure on Hamas, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=224.4s)]
*  by making them pay, by destroying their military machine, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=227.88s)]
*  by eliminating their senior commanders, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=230.88s)]
*  we're actually acting to facilitate [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=233.72s)]
*  the expeditious release of our hostages [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=236.44s)]
*  because as President Biden himself said, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=238.84s)]
*  Hamas only understands pressure. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  And believe me, they understand the military pressure [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=243.72s)]
*  that the Israeli defense forces are applying at this moment. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=245.8s)]
*  You know, Israel knows a thing or two about pressure as well. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=248.84s)]
*  You're getting it from all over the world. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=251.8s)]
*  A lot of people lecturing you on overdoing it [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=253.28s)]
*  and your response to the horrific October 7th attacks [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=255.88s)]
*  you've accurately and correctly pointed out [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=259.24s)]
*  that the United States did and would do the same again [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=262.12s)]
*  in similar circumstances. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=266.2s)]
*  9-11 is a good example, but you seem to be losing, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=267.76s)]
*  and we mentioned this a lot, this PR war, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=270.72s)]
*  that Hamas seems to have gotten the world behind the notion [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=272.96s)]
*  that we wanna continue to see a truce and release hostages [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=275.76s)]
*  and Israel won't let us. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=279.56s)]
*  So how do you respond to that? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=280.84000000000003s)]
*  You put your finger, Neil, right on the problem [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=283.32s)]
*  because Hamas says we want a truce, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=285.59999999999997s)]
*  we wanna stop the fighting. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=287.68s)]
*  And to a lot of people around the world, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=289.8s)]
*  including in the United States, oh, that sounds logical. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=291.64s)]
*  Of course, let's end the bloodshed. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=293.71999999999997s)]
*  What's the problem, Neil? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=295.71999999999997s)]
*  That if Hamas remains in power, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=297.24s)]
*  you'll have me interviewed here on your program [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=299.32s)]
*  in six months or in a year and we'll have another Gaza war. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=301.56s)]
*  Why? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=304.0s)]
*  Because Hamas says openly, given the opportunity, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=305.15999999999997s)]
*  they would commit another October 7th massacre. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=308.32s)]
*  They say they would do it again and again and again. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=312.24s)]
*  Hamas is not a normal player. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=316.72s)]
*  They're like Al-Qaeda, they're like ISIS. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=318.32s)]
*  They are committed to their violent terrorism, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=322.36s)]
*  their extremism, their jihad. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=325.68s)]
*  For them, there is no Israel. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=327.84s)]
*  It should be destroyed. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=329.48s)]
*  For them, there are no Israelis. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=330.76s)]
*  They should all be killed. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=332.08s)]
*  They should all be murdered. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=333.08s)]
*  That's part of their charter. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=334.4s)]
*  And so I think it's people need to understand. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=337.2s)]
*  This ceasefire that people are calling for [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=340.32s)]
*  might have good intentions, but it's misguided [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=344.4s)]
*  because it's actually a band-aid solution. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=347.76s)]
*  It just gives you a temporary timeout [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=350.52s)]
*  for Hamas to regroup and rearm, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=355.52s)]
*  and then they will attack us again [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=357.55999999999995s)]
*  and we'll be back to square one. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=359.2s)]
*  We don't agree to that, and we shouldn't agree to that. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=360.79999999999995s)]
*  And the Israeli people, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=363.23999999999995s)]
*  especially those citizens who live in the south of Israel [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=364.59999999999997s)]
*  who've seen Hamas cross the border [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=368.24s)]
*  and butcher their communities. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=370.88s)]
*  We will not stand for that any longer, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=374.40000000000003s)]
*  and we refuse to live next to this terror enclave [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=376.0s)]
*  on our southern border. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=379.52000000000004s)]
*  And I think anyone in our situation would understand [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=380.8s)]
*  that there is no one should have to live [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=383.64s)]
*  in such a situation with terrorists [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=387.2s)]
*  just across the frontier, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=388.72s)]
*  threatening to come across the border and kill them. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=390.92s)]
*  No, no one should stand for that, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=393.0s)]
*  and we won't stand for that. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=394.72s)]
*  So when there are separately reports [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=395.92s)]
*  that you won't stand for it even after the war, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=398.16s)]
*  and that Israel will be targeting Hamas leaders [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=400.84000000000003s)]
*  all over the world, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=403.56s)]
*  well, a good many of those leaders are in Qatar, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=404.40000000000003s)]
*  supposedly negotiating for and working on behalf [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=406.88s)]
*  of both sides to hammer out yet another truce. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=411.48s)]
*  So would those attacks to target Hamas leaders include Qatar? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=414.88s)]
*  You know, the United States spend a lot of time [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=422.92s)]
*  and effort to take out Osama Bin Laden, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=424.96000000000004s)]
*  and you got him in the end, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=427.92s)]
*  and it's good that you got him. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=429.16s)]
*  And so we look at the same way [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=431.2s)]
*  as the Hamas has seen your leadership, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=432.52000000000004s)]
*  both their leadership in Gaza and their leadership abroad. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=434.04s)]
*  Anyone who is responsible for the butcher of our people, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=437.40000000000003s)]
*  and remember that terrible day in October [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=441.72s)]
*  when they murdered over 1,200 Israelis, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=444.36s)]
*  in proportionate terms, it was like 29, 11s, yes? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=448.28000000000003s)]
*  If you look at the percentage of our population [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=452.96000000000004s)]
*  that was murdered, they took 240 of our citizens [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=454.84000000000003s)]
*  and others hostage and took them to Gaza [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=458.92s)]
*  after abducting them. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=461.96000000000004s)]
*  We don't have to stand for this. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=464.48s)]
*  And we will, anyone involved in commanding that operation [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=466.36s)]
*  will pay a price and we will reach them. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=471.32s)]
*  And it doesn't matter where they are, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=473.92s)]
*  we will reach them. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=475.28000000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=476.36s)]
*  No, that's what I brutally interrupted. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=477.68s)]
*  You finished it. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=479.68s)]
*  No matter where they are, right? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=480.8s)]
*  We will reach them and justice will be done. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=483.44s)]
*  All right, Mark, thank you very much, sir, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=491.15999999999997s)]
*  for that interruption at the end there. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=492.76s)]
*  Mark Rager, the Senior Advisor [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=493.8s)]
*  to the Israeli Prime Minister. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfwR3zc8XSY&t=494.92s)]
