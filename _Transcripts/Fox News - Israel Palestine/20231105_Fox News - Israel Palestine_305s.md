# Former US ambassador reveals ‘real evidence’ that Israel did not target civilians
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54)
*  My colleague Griff Jenkins and I spoke with some of the protesters at the pro-Palestinian march yesterday in Washington, DC [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=0.0s)]
*  Here's what some of them had to say [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=6.26s)]
*  Do you condemn Hamas or do you support their efforts do you condemn 75 years of occupation? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=9.5s)]
*  That's the answer. Do you clearly support the Palestinian people? Do you support Hamas? I [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=18.48s)]
*  Don't just support the Palestinian people. I am a supporter and I do support Hamas in their struggle [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=24.96s)]
*  Hamas did not start anything new should Israel exists [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=29.979999999999997s)]
*  There's no you're from Ohio. Why are you here today? Let's are [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=35.14s)]
*  Everybody hear our voices about [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=39.62s)]
*  Hopefully the country stopped aiding [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=42.5s)]
*  You know Israel did this pretty much bombing everything then this is not a war war is a military against military [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=45.92s)]
*  But this is this is against humanity [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=53.379999999999995s)]
*  period Israel is a fascist state [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=55.58s)]
*  Yeah, and I'm anti-fascist [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=57.78s)]
*  This is not a problem of October 7. This is a problem of 75 years of suffering [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=59.78s)]
*  75 years of massacre after massacre [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=66.94s)]
*  We are the only probably occupied. It's like enslaved people [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=70.17999999999999s)]
*  All we need is our freedom the US points to Hamas in [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=74.7s)]
*  Gaza and save their terrorists. Do you agree? That's unacceptable [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=79.9s)]
*  Those were thoughts from some of the protesters who marched from Frida Plaza here in DC to the White House yesterday [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=83.42s)]
*  For more on the anti-israel protests and the Israel war I'm joined by former US ambassador to Israel David Friedman [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=90.94s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, welcome [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=97.14s)]
*  Thanks Mike. Thanks for having me. So we are seeing the far left turn up its accusations of the Israelis [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=99.14s)]
*  Purposefully targeting civilians. Are you seeing any evidence of that sir? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=105.82000000000001s)]
*  I'm seeing evidence of just the opposite Mike. I'll give you an example last night. There was a big open-air event [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=110.34s)]
*  Outside the Al-Shifa Hospital, which is the largest [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=116.74s)]
*  Hospital in Gaza City. It was sponsored by Hamas about a thousand Gazans were there Hamas [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=119.74s)]
*  sponsored a screening on a big LED screen of kind of their best of the best of their attacks against [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=126.86s)]
*  Israelis much to the delight of the of the Israeli [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=134.34s)]
*  Israelis much to the delight of the of the audience and [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=137.89999999999998s)]
*  And this tells us a few things a number one [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=141.94s)]
*  It tells us that there's plenty of electricity in Gaza [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=144.72s)]
*  At least Hamas has plenty of electricity because this was you know, a big screening lots of lights big screen [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=147.1s)]
*  It tells us that not all the civilians in [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=152.94s)]
*  In Gaza are innocent. Here's a thousand people that are [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=156.85999999999999s)]
*  That are you know, really enjoying their evening watching the Israelis attack [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=160.17999999999998s)]
*  More importantly it shows that Israel is not targeting civilians because you couldn't find a less sympathetic group of civilians [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=164.38s)]
*  Anywhere on the Gaza Strip than these thousand people who are cheering the attacks on Israel [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=170.78s)]
*  Israel could have killed the woman in one bomb but they didn't and and maybe the most important thing might is that nobody there [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=175.5s)]
*  Thinks that Israel's targeting civilians because what they did they wouldn't have shown up [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=182.5s)]
*  So you have you have just in that one event? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=185.98000000000002s)]
*  Real proof real evidence that Israel is not targeting civilians [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=189.26000000000002s)]
*  And of course all these people who are who are demonstrating they they I would doubt that any of them have ever been for this territory [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=192.5s)]
*  and and you know [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=198.98000000000002s)]
*  the fundamental premise that Israel's occupying the Gaza Strip is completely false because you know since [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=201.54000000000002s)]
*  2005 when Israel left the Gaza Strip there hasn't been an Israeli soldier or an Israeli citizen there was handed over to [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=207.5s)]
*  The people of Gaza and they said, you know build a beautiful place here [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=213.98000000000002s)]
*  It's a beautiful territory and instead they chose terrorism the Israeli ambassador to the UN seems quite alarmed by the rise in anti-semitism [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=217.42s)]
*  Let's play it. I [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=224.98s)]
*  Think that the situation right now is is shocking. We are on the brink of a catastrophe even here in the United States [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=229.82s)]
*  we see now thousands of [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=237.74s)]
*  People chanting death to Israel death to the Jews [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=240.82s)]
*  What's your feeling sir? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=246.02s)]
*  Look, you know, I I had been saying for years that we need to watch anti-semitism on the left [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=248.62s)]
*  It's not just the neo-nazis. Of course, it's it includes the neo-nazis [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=253.82000000000002s)]
*  But it's not just them and there's rising anti-semitism on the left in the universities [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=258.22s)]
*  You know the Biden administration came out a few months ago with an anti-semitism report to much fanfare [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=262.42s)]
*  But one issue they never addressed was [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=267.54s)]
*  Anti-semitism, you know masquerading as anti-zionism on college campuses because that's a large part of their voting base [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=271.18s)]
*  But that's the risk right now. That's where the energy is behind anti-semitism and it's worse than anytime [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=277.78000000000003s)]
*  My lifetime mr. Ambassador. We have to go for breaking news, but thank you very much for your time, sir [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLodNJXq54&t=284.58s)]
