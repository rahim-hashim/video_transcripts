# Ted Cruz: 'This is the Wuhan lab of the woke virus'
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4)
*  There's incredible support by Americans for Israel, for the Jewish people, and horror [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=0.0s)]
*  at the rising tide of anti-Semitism we're seeing. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  But I think there's been a lot of fear and intimidation and fear by Jews and by friends [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=8.68s)]
*  of Jews to speak up on their campuses. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=14.18s)]
*  Most important thing is to overcome that fear, to realize we have so many allies, so many [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=16.4s)]
*  people of goodwill. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=22.38s)]
*  Daniel Krauthammer with us earlier about that rally in Washington yesterday with hundreds [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=24.48s)]
*  of thousands voicing their support for Israel and fighting back against the wave of anti-Semitism [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=28.3s)]
*  plaguing the nation. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=32.980000000000004s)]
*  But that message apparently not getting through at Harvard. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=34.14s)]
*  More than a hundred faculty members there signing an open letter blasting the university [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=37.260000000000005s)]
*  president for condemning hatred of Jews. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=41.42s)]
*  Joining us now is Republican Senator Ted Cruz. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=44.86s)]
*  He's a Harvard graduate, also the author of the new book, Unwoke, How to Defeat Cultural [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=46.980000000000004s)]
*  Marxism in America. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=50.900000000000006s)]
*  So timing of the book is pretty good. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=52.2s)]
*  I have to hear, here's the letter to Harvard, sir. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=54.74s)]
*  The letter says that, it's important to acknowledge the patronizing tone and format of much of [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=57.62s)]
*  the criticism you have received as well as the outright racism contained in some of it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=61.54s)]
*  We were nevertheless profaned by your November 9th message entitled, Combating Anti-Semitism. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=67.02s)]
*  What's happening at your alma mater? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=73.54s)]
*  Look, there is a profound sickness at our universities and sadly Harvard is the locus [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=75.86s)]
*  for it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=82.06s)]
*  And you're right, this is the central topic in my brand new book, Unwoke, How to Defeat [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=83.38s)]
*  Cultural Marxism in America. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=89.3s)]
*  And in this book, I address how our elite institutions and how our major institutions [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=91.64s)]
*  in America have been captured by the radical left. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=98.22s)]
*  And the very first chapter starts front and center with the universities. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=101.41999999999999s)]
*  I call the universities the Wuhan lab of the woke virus. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=105.46s)]
*  It's where it started. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=110.14s)]
*  It's where it mutated. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=111.14s)]
*  It's where it spread. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=112.9s)]
*  You look at how messed up Harvard is. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=113.9s)]
*  That when the October 7th horrific attacks in Israel happened, when over 1,200 Israelis [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=116.5s)]
*  were murdered, when Hamas terrorists were raping women, were raping little girls, were [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=122.98s)]
*  murdering infants, were literally putting babies in an oven. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=127.74s)]
*  How did Harvard react? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=132.06s)]
*  35 student groups put out a disgraceful statement saying all of the violence by Hamas terrorists [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=133.58s)]
*  is 100% the fault of Israel. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=141.22s)]
*  By the way, just down the river at MIT, we've seen this week, it has been horrific at MIT, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=144.1s)]
*  Jewish students were physically and violently prevented from going to class by anti-Israel, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=149.94s)]
*  anti-Semitic protesters. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=156.38s)]
*  And the administration at MIT shamefully won't expel the students who are violently preventing [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=158.5s)]
*  Jewish students from going to class. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=165.42000000000002s)]
*  The Jewish students are saying they don't feel safe. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=166.98000000000002s)]
*  They don't think MIT is safe for Jews. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=169.45999999999998s)]
*  And the university's reason for not expelling the violent protesters, they say, well, they're [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=171.78s)]
*  here on student visas, so they'd lose their visa. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=176.44s)]
*  Well, they should lose their visa. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=179.1s)]
*  If they're a guest in our country, they don't have a right to engage in racist acts of violence. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=181.33999999999997s)]
*  We've also seen this week at University of Maryland anti-Israel protests where there [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=186.77999999999997s)]
*  are reports that they were chanting Holocaust 2.0. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=191.26s)]
*  This is sick. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=195.67999999999998s)]
*  It is twisted. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=196.67999999999998s)]
*  And it is a manifestation. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=198.22s)]
*  My book explains why this happened, which is the cultural Marxist views the world in [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=199.5s)]
*  Karl Marx's prism between oppressors and victims. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=205.66s)]
*  And for the radical left, they've decided the Jews are the oppressors and the Palestinians [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=209.02s)]
*  are the victims. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=214.56s)]
*  And accordingly, they support a violent revolution of the victims. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=215.56s)]
*  And that's why they're cheering on the acts of violence and the murder of children in [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=220.46s)]
*  Israel because they are rooting for the Hamas terrorists. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=225.3s)]
*  It's disgraceful. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=228.14000000000001s)]
*  Senator, while we have you just in the last minute we have, could you tell us your thoughts [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=229.14000000000001s)]
*  about the President Biden, President Xi meeting today? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=233.26000000000002s)]
*  Do you have any hope for what could come out of it? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=236.54000000000002s)]
*  Any suggestions for what should be accomplished? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=239.02s)]
*  Well, I have a lot of suggestions. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=241.54000000000002s)]
*  And actually, the last chapter in my book is on China. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=244.26s)]
*  And it explains how China is connected to this woke virus every institution. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=247.06s)]
*  One of the things I talk about in my book is Mark Swidan, who is an American. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=252.58s)]
*  He's been wrongfully held in China for 10 years. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=256.14s)]
*  And if Biden were standing up and fighting for Americans, he would be telling Xi, release [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=259.21999999999997s)]
*  Mark Swidan now. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=264.02s)]
*  I have no confidence that he did that because the Democrat Party, sadly, is structurally [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=265.21999999999997s)]
*  pro-China. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=271.44s)]
*  They're major stakeholders. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=272.44s)]
*  Big business, big tech, big Hollywood and big universities, they are all in bed with [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=274.28s)]
*  China. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=280.38s)]
*  The central point of my book that I think is so important, Unwoke, is we've got to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=282.38s)]
*  retake these institutions. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=287.5s)]
*  We've got to bring them back. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=289.7s)]
*  And this book gives a common sense strategy for doing so. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=290.7s)]
*  The book is available in every bookstore. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=295.42s)]
*  It's available on Amazon. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=297.06s)]
*  I'm sure it is. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=298.06s)]
*  And I'll tell you, it makes also a great Christmas gift. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=299.06s)]
*  I would encourage you stand up and fight to take these institutions back because if we [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=301.42s)]
*  don't, we'll lose our country. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=306.78s)]
*  Senator Ted Cruz, thank you for being on the show today. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Qo8K4NMP4&t=308.94s)]
