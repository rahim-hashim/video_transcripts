# ‘Bittersweet’: Hostage return a ‘ray of light’ in very dark times, says Itay Milner
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs)
*  Let's go ahead and bring in E. Ty Milner. He's spokesperson for the Israeli consulate in New York. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=0.0s)]
*  Sir, thanks for taking time with us this afternoon. A moment ago, Ambassador Ragev [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=5.36s)]
*  characterized today and everything that we've seen and heard as bittersweet. He said, obviously, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=9.28s)]
*  it's a wonderful day for the families of the hostages and the hostages who were freed. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=14.56s)]
*  It also highlights the plight that's still ahead for the remaining people, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=18.96s)]
*  Israelis and foreigners, in Hamas captivity. How are you feeling? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  I think I described it pretty well. It is bittersweet. For me personally, I find some [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=30.0s)]
*  comfort to see some of the hostages that I already know very well from posters around New York City [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=37.84s)]
*  and from information that I read about to finally see them again and frankly to see that some of [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=46.0s)]
*  them look like they're okay, all right. We know that some of them are not all right and they were [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=53.44s)]
*  taken to a hospital for treatment, but it's certainly a ray of light in these very, very [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=59.52s)]
*  dark times. But yeah, we are also very concerned and worried for the more than 200 hostages that [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=66.72s)]
*  are still in Gaza. We hope that the next few days we will see the release of more of them, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=75.12s)]
*  but we can't know for sure until they're actually crossing to the border to Israel, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=82.4s)]
*  because Hamas has proven one after another that they're not following the awards. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=88.48s)]
*  I'm curious what you think of President Biden. I don't know if you got a chance to hear President [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=101.68s)]
*  Biden's remarks a few moments ago. I'll play one sound bite from him here where he talks about [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  why October 7th unfolded the way that it did, why he believes, not based on intelligence, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=115.52s)]
*  he says that it happened when it did. I'd like to get your response on the other side. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=121.52s)]
*  I cannot prove what I'm about to say, but I believe one of the reasons why Hamas struck when [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=126.24s)]
*  they did was they knew that I was working very closely with the Saudis and others in the region [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=131.84s)]
*  to bring peace to the region by having recognition of Israel and Israel's right to exist. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=138.32s)]
*  Does that assessment square with what you know about that day? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=145.68s)]
*  100 percent. We know about the linkage between Hamas and Iran, and we know that for Iran, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=150.96s)]
*  the worst scenario is to have normalization between their two biggest foes in the Middle East, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=160.88000000000002s)]
*  Saudi Arabia and Israel. So you don't have to be, you don't have to have hard proof, you know, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=168.24s)]
*  you only have to have this proof about, although we do have hard proof, about Iranian involvement [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=174.16s)]
*  and why, what their motives. I think that they did it intentionally because they wanted to create [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=183.04s)]
*  a public opinion problem for Israel in the Arab world, and unfortunately they're succeeding with [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=194.32s)]
*  it. We're seeing demonstrations of people in most of the Arab countries, including in Saudi [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=201.6s)]
*  Arabia, but I think that in the long run, they will achieve the opposite from what they wanted [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=207.84s)]
*  because Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Arab world now see very well, they see it in front [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=215.28s)]
*  of their eyes, that we have the same enemies. Even the Houthis, who are Saudi Arabia's biggest [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=221.76s)]
*  enemies, they're attacking Israel right now. So what is more clear than the fact that there is one [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=228.96s)]
*  destabilizer in the Middle East? It's Iran, and we all have to unify it and be against them. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=236.8s)]
*  So we learned a moment ago, a moment before you joined us, that the Israelis had received [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=245.60000000000002s)]
*  the list of hostages that Hamas claims to be planning to release tomorrow. Would you characterize [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=250.08s)]
*  that? How would you characterize it? Is that a positive development? Are you skeptical of it? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=257.52s)]
*  It's a positive development in the sense that we see that they have an intention of releasing [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=264.4s)]
*  more hostages tomorrow. Like I said before, we can't really trust anything that comes from Hamas. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=270.4s)]
*  One of the women that was released today, she was already declared by Hamas as deceased. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=281.12s)]
*  So we can't really take their word. We also heard from them that there will be Americans in this [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=290.88000000000005s)]
*  batch, and there wasn't. There weren't. So we can't really trust it. We're just going to have to wait [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=296.72s)]
*  and see until they cross the border. The government of Israel also is not issuing any statement, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=304.32s)]
*  any information to the public regarding the hostages that Hamas is stating that will be released [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=310.4s)]
*  because we don't want anyone to be disappointed and we don't want to spread false information. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=318.71999999999997s)]
*  Okay. Itai Milner, thanks for taking time with us on this very important day. We appreciate it, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=325.52s)]
*  as always. Thank you. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ4skNfyWBs&t=330.4s)]
