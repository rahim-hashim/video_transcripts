*  The President, we've known each other for 40 years, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xV00fGKgRCo&t=0.0s)]
*  and you've known every Israeli Prime Minister for 50 years, from Golda Meir. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xV00fGKgRCo&t=28.76s)]
*  So from a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xV00fGKgRCo&t=32.760000000000005s)]
*  I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the State of Israel. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xV00fGKgRCo&t=39.760000000000005s)]

*  I got to know her that first meeting with Prime Minister Golda Meir, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xV00fGKgRCo&t=53.76s)]

*  That's how far back it goes. I was only 12 then. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xV00fGKgRCo&t=59.76s)]
*  Anyway, thank you all for being here. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xV00fGKgRCo&t=63.76s)]
