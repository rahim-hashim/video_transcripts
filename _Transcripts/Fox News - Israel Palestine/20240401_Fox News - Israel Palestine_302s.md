# Massive protests erupt in Israel as pressure mounts to secure release of hostages
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg)
*  This from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=0.0s)]
*  So you had massive protests erupting across Israel. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=2.0s)]
*  The families of many of the hostages joining those calling for a ceasefire in one of the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=12.08s)]
*  most forceful demonstrations since the war began, putting new pressure on the Prime Minister [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=16.6s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu after nearly six months of war against Hamas. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=21.12s)]
*  Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, now Fox News contributor. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=24.84s)]
*  Sir, nice to have you back on our program and thanks for being here today. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=27.72s)]
*  Bibi Netanyahu is in the hospital set for release tomorrow and Tuesday being treated [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=31.72s)]
*  now for hernia. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=36.5s)]
*  This is what he said on Sunday on not giving an inch to Hamas. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=37.5s)]
*  I'm doing everything and will do everything to bring our loved ones home. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  If we don't stand together to rebuff attacks, then nobody else will do it for us. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=50.0s)]
*  If we give in to another demand every two days, will this bring about a deal? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=55.62s)]
*  This is the opposite of the truth. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=60.86s)]
*  It would paralyze negotiations for freeing our hostages. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=62.9s)]
*  You got two stories here. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=65.78s)]
*  You got the folks in the streets and you know what their position is. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=67.62s)]
*  And you've got a prime minister so far who has shown that he's not turning his back on [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=71.56s)]
*  this fight in Gaza. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=75.94s)]
*  To you then, what gives, if anything here? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=78.1s)]
*  Well, Bill, I think what we've seen even in the last few days with them taking some 500 [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=82.74s)]
*  plus terrorists out of this hospital, think about this Bill, a hospital we take for granted [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=88.06s)]
*  now when we hear about this, 500 terrorists out of a hospital in Gaza, we realize that [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=91.61999999999999s)]
*  the fight is not over, Hamas is not yet defeated and that is the central task. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=95.89999999999999s)]
*  If you're going to get hostages back, the only way to do it is to put pressure on Hamas [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=100.53999999999999s)]
*  and pressure on Iran. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=105.47999999999999s)]
*  Those are the two pinch points. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=106.74s)]
*  They're the decision makers for releasing these hostages and anything else will just [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=107.94s)]
*  show weakness. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=111.94s)]
*  There'll be more hostages taken. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=112.94s)]
*  We shouldn't forget. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=114.89999999999999s)]
*  We watch these protests and we sometimes here at home forget there's Americans that continue [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=115.89999999999999s)]
*  to be held there. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=119.22s)]
*  So while we're all focused on, rightfully on the Americans held in Russia and Americans [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=120.46s)]
*  held elsewhere, we need to remember there are still Americans held by the Iranians in [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=124.25999999999999s)]
*  Gaza and putting pressure on Hamas, not letting UN resolutions pass the call for ceasefires. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=128.06s)]
*  It's a U.S. mistake, not allowing Hamas to confiscate food that's being delivered there [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=134.66s)]
*  and use it for their own purposes. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=141.54s)]
*  Those are the things that encourage Hamas to continue their war. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=143.38s)]
*  They need to be defeated Bill. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=146.42s)]
*  That's the only answer to getting these people home. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=147.57999999999998s)]
*  Okay, you mentioned the hospital, Al-Shifa Hospital, northern part of Gaza, Gaza City. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=149.46s)]
*  That's been the center of a lot of action over the last couple of weeks. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=153.54s)]
*  Former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett sent this tweet out a few hours ago. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=157.26s)]
*  He talked about 6,000 civilians evacuated. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=161.02s)]
*  He talked about 200 Hamas terrorists killed, 500 Hamas terrorists captured and zero civilian [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=165.46s)]
*  deaths. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=173.5s)]
*  That's what the Israeli position is. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=175.3s)]
*  We have not heard what the Hamas position is. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=177.10000000000002s)]
*  But what he went on to say is that this is unprecedented in urban warfare. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=181.82000000000002s)]
*  Now, you're an army man. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=185.58s)]
*  You understand it better than most. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=187.5s)]
*  How do you interpret the operation that is still, well, wrapped up as of now because [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=189.34s)]
*  the Israeli forces pulled back in the last 24 hours? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=195.3s)]
*  Bill, you know this. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=199.38s)]
*  We've seen this when our young men and women were fighting in Iraq and elsewhere. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=201.22s)]
*  Urban warfare is incredibly difficult. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=204.54s)]
*  If they pulled any of this off remotely, as described by former Prime Minister Bennett, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=206.54s)]
*  that is an amazing accomplishment. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=210.94s)]
*  Even if there were a handful of civilians that were killed to get 500 terrorists captured [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=212.7s)]
*  a couple hundred more and to have that much minimal collateral damage is a remarkable [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=217.14s)]
*  feat. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=221.78s)]
*  It only goes to say what I think most of us have known all along, Bill. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=222.78s)]
*  Israelis are fighting this in a way that the world should recommend to others. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=226.1s)]
*  They're doing this in a way that's fundamentally decent, doing their level best to defeat Hamas [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=230.57999999999998s)]
*  while Hamas is trying to put civilians in the way of the line of fire. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=235.1s)]
*  I guess one other thought as I watch what happened in that hospital. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=239.26s)]
*  Imagine that just two weeks ago, let alone two months ago, Bill, that there had been [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=242.66s)]
*  a ceasefire, that we had all weakened to the pro-Hamas part of the Democrat party and said, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=246.54s)]
*  you know what, let's just hang it up. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=251.7s)]
*  Let's put down our weapons and let's call it good. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=253.22s)]
*  Those 500, 700, 900 terrorists would perform October 7th all over again, and that would [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=256.1s)]
*  put even more Americans at risk. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=261.86s)]
*  There's only one way through the fire here, and that is to continue to attack and to continue [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=264.21999999999997s)]
*  to take out that infrastructure and then for the United States to support the Israelis [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=268.1s)]
*  in this important undertaking. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=272.52s)]
*  Do you think there's a role for U.S. forces in Gaza, or is that a pipe dream? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=273.79999999999995s)]
*  No, I don't see a role for U.S. forces, and frankly, no one, neither the Israelis nor [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=278.79999999999995s)]
*  the Gulf Arab states have asked for that yet. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=285.0s)]
*  I don't think that will in the end make sense. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=287.59999999999997s)]
*  There'll be a solution to this, but that solution can only be contemplated once Hamas and Iran [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=289.96s)]
*  have been defeated. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=295.2s)]
*  Yeah, fair point. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=296.2s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=297.2s)]
*  We'll talk later in the week. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=298.2s)]
*  Mike, bye. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=299.2s)]
*  Bill, thank you. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=300.2s)]
*  Bless you. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=301.2s)]
*  Have a good day. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUgS36LACYg&t=302.2s)]
