# ‘FEELING HOPELESS’: Family of Hamas hostages detail rising anxiety
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [May 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0)
*  Meanwhile, on the eve of Israel's Memorial Day, the hostages families forum is dedicating [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=0.0s)]
*  today's rally to the families of the 38 murdered individuals whose bodies are being held captive [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  by Hamas in Gaza. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=10.6s)]
*  Demonstrations like this one are taking place weekly in the country, asking the government [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=12.6s)]
*  to prioritize the release of hostages over operations in Gaza. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=17.12s)]
*  Joining me now, two members, family members of those Israeli hostages, Jonathan Dekelchen [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=23.52s)]
*  and his son, Sigrid Dekelchen, is a Hamas hostage, and Daniel Lifshitz, his grandfather, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=29.48s)]
*  opeds 84th birthday today in captivity. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=34.44s)]
*  He's been in captivity since October 7th. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=38.72s)]
*  Thank you both for being here so much. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=42.08s)]
*  I just want to begin with the fact that you have a great grandfather celebrating his 84th [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=44.76s)]
*  birthday in captivity being held by Hamas. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=51.08s)]
*  That is really just a stunning thing. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=55.18s)]
*  That is completely devastating. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=58.08s)]
*  And I never thought we would come to this day that a great grandfather, the only great [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=63.28s)]
*  grandfather held hostage in the world, my grandfather, who fought all his life for peace [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=70.0s)]
*  and for justice, will be for almost 220 days held hostage in Gaza with no conditions. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=75.32s)]
*  I tell you, in that age, so long is really almost feeling hopeless. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=86.32s)]
*  But then you just spoke about all the murdered ones, and 10 of them are from Kibbutz-Niroz. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=93.32s)]
*  For us, 36 from Kibbutz-Niroz are still held hostage in Gaza, which is a huge number. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=99.32s)]
*  One of them is Saghi, which is one of my best friends from the Kibbutz, from the same group, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  the guy who taught us baseball on the grass of the Kibbutz. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=110.36s)]
*  I tell you, it's a very hard day for me. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=116.8s)]
*  I didn't think it would be so difficult, but it's very difficult for me to function today. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=119.0s)]
*  I think that my grandfather is celebrating. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=125.76s)]
*  There is no celebration on that, of his birthday in Gaza today, in May 11th. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=129.64s)]
*  When you hear the Biden administration cautioning Israel against a large-scale ground operation, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=136.23999999999998s)]
*  obviously there's been a lot of concern raised about the plight of Palestinians in Gaza [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=144.16s)]
*  and the famine that they're facing. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=150.56s)]
*  But at the same time, you have four Hamas battalions there continuing to hold hostages [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=153.04s)]
*  and use human shields. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=160.35999999999999s)]
*  So when you hear the administration publicly telling Israel to dial back, and you're not [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=163.92s)]
*  hearing that quite as much as public calls for Hamas to release the hostages, how is [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=169.79999999999998s)]
*  that digested among your families? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=176.44s)]
*  How do you respond to that? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=180.39999999999998s)]
*  How do you feel about that when you're watching this public messaging that seems to be dedicated [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=181.88s)]
*  more toward Israel than to Hamas? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=185.56s)]
*  We know that the end of the war is downriver to the release of the hostages. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=189.64000000000001s)]
*  If tomorrow there will be the agreement for release of all the hostages, there will be [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=194.16s)]
*  no more war. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=198.20000000000002s)]
*  And of course I would prefer everyone to sit on the negotiation table without fighting. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=200.72s)]
*  But you know, sometimes in the Middle East the negotiations are under fire. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=205.64000000000001s)]
*  We saw Hamas shooting the rockets on Kerem Shalom, a devastating moment when a few soldiers [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=209.54000000000002s)]
*  died. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=216.42000000000002s)]
*  And then a few days after they came to say yes on the agreement. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=217.42000000000002s)]
*  I hope from the other side now it's kind of a pressure that will very soon and hopefully [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=220.70000000000002s)]
*  just after independence date will bring an agreement. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=228.58s)]
*  I think what is important is that all the parties will negotiate under the table, on [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=232.1s)]
*  the table, and will not go off of it until they get an agreement. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=238.5s)]
*  Those people are dying every day. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=243.3s)]
*  We just heard another one today. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=245.22s)]
*  So really there is nothing else to do except getting into the negotiation table and make [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=247.34s)]
*  a fair deal for everyone. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=253.22s)]
*  The U.S. has to press for a fair deal for everyone and come to an agreement as fast [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=255.1s)]
*  as possible because for me in the humanitarian part we are losing everyone and everyone are [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=260.3s)]
*  humanitarian now. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=265.82s)]
*  Jonathan, I want to ask you, you know, when you hear the Biden administration saying that [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=267.82s)]
*  they would approve of a small scale operation that does very specific things like target [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=273.14s)]
*  Hamas leaders and try to prevent weapons from being smuggled in to Gaza via its border with [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=278.78000000000003s)]
*  Egypt and these sort of pie in the sky ideas about how this might be effective in eradicating [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=285.78000000000003s)]
*  the terrorist threat that's posed by Hamas. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=293.98s)]
*  You know this area well. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=298.48s)]
*  Is that going to be effective in achieving the outcome of bringing these hostages home? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=300.66s)]
*  I mean it's been months now. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=306.38000000000005s)]
*  Yes, it has. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=309.38000000000005s)]
*  Thank you for having us on. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=314.18s)]
*  You're right. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=316.22s)]
*  I've lived on the border with Gaza my entire adult life. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=317.22s)]
*  I cannot say for sure whether this act or that act is going to move things forward or [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=321.26000000000005s)]
*  not. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=330.54s)]
*  I think we have to accept certain facts. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=331.54s)]
*  Fact number one is that friends can disagree and in this case there seems to be a disagreement [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=333.78000000000003s)]
*  around how to go into ruffa between the Biden administration and Israel. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=338.66s)]
*  That being said, and I'm a U.S. citizen and have been really in steady contact with the [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=345.38s)]
*  Biden administration and with Congress, what President Biden says is true. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=350.02000000000004s)]
*  The administration's support for Israel to its own political detriment has been ironclad [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=357.42s)]
*  and the Biden administration has been clear with Israel now for weeks if not months that [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=363.18s)]
*  full scale invasion into Raffa full of civilians is unacceptable. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=368.3s)]
*  Whether our own government, Israel, wants to listen to that is another question. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=375.92s)]
*  As far as the hostages are concerned, I think any level-headed person understands, as well [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=381.16s)]
*  as military people, I was in the army most of my life in Israel, the only way the hostages [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=390.04s)]
*  are coming out alive, those who might still be alive, including my son Sigi and Daniel's [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=396.52000000000004s)]
*  grandfather, the only way they're coming out alive is through some sort of negotiated agreement. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=402.6s)]
*  Every action on its own will only get them killed because of the nature of Hamas that [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=409.56s)]
*  looks to martyr, it doesn't look to save lives, it looks to martyr lives, Israeli lives and [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=415.88s)]
*  particularly Palestinian lives. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=421.88s)]
*  So all parties involved of good faith, including the Israeli government, have to be totally [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=424.32s)]
*  committed to this idea of negotiations in order to get people home, those who are alive [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=430.92s)]
*  and bring back those people. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=436.88s)]
*  And again, there are 10 of them that are, Daniel grew up around them, I raised some of them [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=438.4s)]
*  that were murdered and their bodies are being held and we want them to come home for proper burial. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=443.92s)]
*  So as far as the Biden administration is concerned and the hostages, I would say that [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=448.8s)]
*  it's much more subtle than is currently certainly being presented by the Israeli government, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=455.28s)]
*  you know, their resistance. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=460.48s)]
*  They have not told Israel not to go into Raffa. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=461.6s)]
*  They've told Israel that there should by no means be a repeat of large scale civilian casualties [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=464.88s)]
*  and the vast majority of the Israeli population agrees with that. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=471.76s)]
*  It is a heart wrenching situation. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=477.12s)]
*  My heart goes out to you, Jonathan, and your son and Daniel, you and your grandfather and [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=480.56s)]
*  all the families affected by this horrible thing that is happening. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=485.76s)]
*  Thank you for sharing your stories with us. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=490.48s)]
*  Hope to have you back again soon. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQuOoArYKt0&t=492.40000000000003s)]
