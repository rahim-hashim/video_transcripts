# 'Absolute abomination': Hosts stunned at Nasrallah reporting
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [September 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc)
*  Tensions keep rising in the Middle East as Israel prepares for a potential [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=0.0s)]
*  imminent ground invasion of Lebanon. Hundreds of tanks and troops are [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=5.16s)]
*  building up on the border as fears grow over a wider war. It comes after the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=9.32s)]
*  IDF killed the leader of the Lebanese based terror group Hezbollah over the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=14.74s)]
*  weekend. Nate Foy is in Tel Aviv with the latest Nate. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=19.0s)]
*  Kayleigh, good afternoon. We have massive breaking news. A senior U. S. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=24.84s)]
*  official says that an Israeli ground incursion, a limited one, is imminent [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=28.68s)]
*  right now in southern Lebanon. It is expected to be smaller in scale and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=33.24s)]
*  quicker than the 2006 second Lebanon war that lasted 34 days and ended in a U. N. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=37.88s)]
*  resolution that mandated that Hezbollah operate north of the Latani River, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=44.8s)]
*  which is something that never actually happened. And that's a big reason why we [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=49.84s)]
*  have this conflict since October 8th when Hezbollah began firing at Israel. I [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=53.4s)]
*  was able to report from Israel's northern border a few months back and [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=58.24s)]
*  we watched and we were toured by the IDF. They explained to us that a lot of [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=62.52s)]
*  those those kibbutz is right up against the border are targeted because the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=67.48s)]
*  terrorists come right up to the southern Lebanon villages and they fire [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=71.84s)]
*  anti tank missiles and RPGs. And that's why 60,000 Israelis have had to [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=75.8s)]
*  evacuate from the north. And today, Defense Minister Yoav Galan says that [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  the goal of this ground incursion that is happening imminently will be to [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=85.88s)]
*  return those residents to their homes. And it's also expected to happen quickly, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  which is something that Israel has done. Really, you think it was just 12 days [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=95.52s)]
*  ago that the pager attack happened the walkie talkie attack right after that. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=99.24s)]
*  And then since then, Israel has really been setting the table for this ground [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=103.72s)]
*  incursion by just systematically taking out Hezbollah's entire leadership [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=108.6s)]
*  structure. And they've done that as they've continued taking fire from [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=114.2s)]
*  several Iranian proxies to missiles in the past four days from the Houthi [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=118.0s)]
*  rebels in Yemen. And then Israel responded, hitting Hadda, the Yemeni [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=122.76s)]
*  port city that the Houthis actually receive weapons from Iran through that [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  port. So massive breaking news right now in the Middle East. Israeli Prime [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=133.6s)]
*  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will receive a security briefing at seven and then [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=138.24s)]
*  the war cabinet will meet at 7 30. We'll send it back to you, Nate. Thank [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=142.12s)]
*  you. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=146.68s)]
*  Meanwhile, the killing of Hezbollah's leader over the weekend was a major win [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=148.32s)]
*  for Israel and its war on the terror group. Hassan Nasrallah had been the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=153.08s)]
*  leader of Hezbollah for over 30 years, and in that time he was responsible for [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=157.36s)]
*  killing hundreds of Americans. But despite his brutal past, the media took [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=162.96s)]
*  a lighter tone in describing him. The Associated Press initially characterizing [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=167.86s)]
*  him as quote charismatic and shrewd in a quote fiery order viewed as an [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=172.42000000000002s)]
*  extremist in the U. S. Who's also quote considered a pragmatist compared to the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=178.58s)]
*  firebrand militants. Imagine that a pragmatist terrorist. First time I've [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=184.10000000000002s)]
*  heard that one. The Washington Post, meanwhile, writing that Nasrallah's [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=188.14000000000001s)]
*  speaking style was quote always in the folksy get articulate manner that he was [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=191.3s)]
*  revered by his followers as a savior and among his followers seen as a father [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=196.78s)]
*  figure, a moral compass. This guy killed hundreds of Americans and yet the New [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=202.48s)]
*  York Times made sure to mention he had quote a propensity to crack jokes. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=207.82s)]
*  Emily, the full New York Times quoted and I think we've got to read it [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=213.68s)]
*  because I just can't imagine an editor reading this and saying, Let's go [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=216.86s)]
*  forward with publishing. Here it is. He came across as a less dour than most [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=221.06s)]
*  Shiite clerics, partly because of his role. E. Poli figure, a slight lisp and a [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=225.85999999999999s)]
*  propensity to crack jokes. He never pushed hard line Islamic rule like [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=230.9s)]
*  veils for women in the neighborhoods that has below controls. Nope. New York [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=235.34s)]
*  Times, but he killed hundreds of Americans. That's right. The veneer [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=239.5s)]
*  around this filth of an individual only underscores the filth that has been the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=243.78s)]
*  Washington Post, the New York Times. If anyone needs any other piece of evidence [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=248.56s)]
*  for why they should cancel subscriptions and not pay attention to those media [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=253.78s)]
*  that are unfortunately disseminated and revered by the left across the globe, it [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=256.7s)]
*  is this. This is an absolute abysmal abomination and I hope that there is [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=261.82s)]
*  some rectification for this, although I'm not holding my breath for it. I [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=265.74s)]
*  have to point out Jared Kushner had added really an incredible analysis of [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=269.3s)]
*  course, given his mind, but he put it on X over the weekend and he talked about [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=272.78s)]
*  the fact that in his countless hours spent studying Hezbollah, no one, no [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=276.88s)]
*  expert ever would predict that Israel could make the strides that it has with [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=281.18s)]
*  this killing of Nasrallah and so much. And he talked about that anyone calling [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=286.14s)]
*  for peace right now has no idea what they're talking about. This is exactly [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=291.82s)]
*  the time for Israel to to finish the job that Iran has for 40 years now been [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=295.38s)]
*  building up their nuclear arsenal as a loaded gun pointed against Israel. The [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=301.54s)]
*  time is now and what they need to have is unanimous United States support. That [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=305.9s)]
*  is not conditional per the Biden administration and it is certainly not [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=310.42s)]
*  the celebration of the assassinated terrorist by the left wing media [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=313.76s)]
*  emanating out of our country. The time is now for unconditional support of [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=318.14s)]
*  Israel. Yeah, instead we heard a call for a ceasefire during your hour Harris. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=321.54s)]
*  You know, this media though, and the way they describe it and you were audibly [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=325.62s)]
*  shocked by some of those statements. It's not a one off because in 2019 the [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=329.18s)]
*  Washington Post, we got to remember this Abu Bakar al Baghdadi. They wrote this. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=333.1s)]
*  He was an austere religious scholar at the helm of the Islamic State. They [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=337.58s)]
*  ultimately changed the headline calling him an extremist leader. But this is not [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=341.94s)]
*  a one off. I remember the day that President Trump announced the killing of [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=345.29999999999995s)]
*  him and who can forget these times when like Salamani when when he was taken [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=350.29999999999995s)]
*  out. I mean, Israel right now is doing us a militaristic favor. Our troops [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=357.7s)]
*  have been hit by the proxy in Yemen north of 200 times in the Middle East. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=364.3s)]
*  Our men and women serving have been hit in that region since October 7th 180 [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=369.38s)]
*  plus times. We have done nothing to deter them. What little this little that we [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=374.14s)]
*  have done is not been equal to what we needed to do to make it stop. Israel hit [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=379.34000000000003s)]
*  Yemen proxies yesterday. They hit the hooties so hard. Now the question is, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=384.34000000000003s)]
*  can they get back up? They hit Hezbollah so hard they killed in two strikes on [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=389.66s)]
*  our U.S. Embassy in Beirut and our Marine barracks more than 300 people. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=394.54s)]
*  Hezbollah did. We didn't hit them in kind, but Israel just did. Yeah, we need [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=401.62s)]
*  to send them a thank you and a fruit basket and shore them up and make sure [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=407.58000000000004s)]
*  we have their back. Israel without a doubt, without a doubt, without a doubt. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=411.70000000000005s)]
*  And you mentioned all of the leaders that have been killed. Rebecca, we'll [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=415.70000000000005s)]
*  pull that up. Israel has done such an incredible job and yet to have Biden [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=418.54s)]
*  say it's time for a ceasefire when you have Hezbollah who's not listening to [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=422.94s)]
*  that U.N. resolution and is forced 70,000 Israelis to leave northern Israel. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=426.54s)]
*  No, there will be no ceasefire. Now the momentum is with Israel and Israel is [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=430.3s)]
*  doing the job that the United States of America should be leading on, which is [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=433.58s)]
*  keeping that those sea lanes open in the Red Sea. It's been essentially shut [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=436.74s)]
*  down because of these hooties, these Iranian terrorists throughout there. So [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=439.86s)]
*  Israel is doing what we should do. They're really executing justice on [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=443.14s)]
*  behalf of Americans from these 1983 Beirut bombings. Justice delayed, but it's [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=446.66s)]
*  still there. But the other thing is too, you know, Iran is going to be in a [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=450.62s)]
*  dilemma because they need to show these proxies that they are the patron that [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=454.02s)]
*  can protect them. But if they respond to Israel, I really think their Iranian [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=457.62s)]
*  their nuclear program is over. I think Israel will respond very forcefully and [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=461.3s)]
*  and completely eliminate that because they are the Iranians have really [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=466.94s)]
*  gotten right on the edge of finally attaining a nuclear weapon. These are [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=471.18s)]
*  terrorist organizations identified by the United States State Department as [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=475.70000000000005s)]
*  terrorist organizations. It's not any more complicated than that. But yet you [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=480.1s)]
*  have Kamala Harris, who wants to be the leader of the free world, going out and [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=484.86s)]
*  telling our American troops that we have no troops in harm's way, that there [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=488.90000000000003s)]
*  are no war zone. Are you kidding me? Those people as you mentioned in the [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=493.86s)]
*  Red Sea in Syria that are wearing the American flag on their sleeves and on [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=497.06s)]
*  their chest, they are in harm's way. And our leaders over there saying, Well, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=502.66s)]
*  there's nothing wrong. We just need a ceasefire. That's not leadership. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=507.42s)]
*  That's not a game plan. That's not going to solve it. Thank goodness. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=510.62s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu knows how to lead an offense that is actually going to get [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=513.6600000000001s)]
*  the job done. Yep. And our media calls them austere scholars and pragmatists. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apaMaqMyUbc&t=518.22s)]
