# Hamas hostages could be taken out of Gaza to Iran, IDF official warns
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [September 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I)
*  The rules of the post is reporting that you're 90% there in negotiations with Hamas towards [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=0.0s)]
*  a ceasefire deal. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=6.36s)]
*  Would you say that's accurate? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=7.48s)]
*  No, it's exactly inaccurate. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=10.48s)]
*  There's not a deal in the making. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=14.48s)]
*  Now that's a little more of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu telling Brian [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  Kilmeade that Hamas has said no to multiple ceasefire deals. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  For more on this, let's bring in Reserve Brigadier General with the IDF. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=26.0s)]
*  And founder of the Israel Defense and Security Forum, Amir Avivi. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=29.92s)]
*  General Avivi, it's a very interesting dichotomy between U.S. officials continuing to say that [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=35.84s)]
*  they're close to a deal with Netanyahu saying that's absolutely inaccurate. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=43.84s)]
*  You heard our reporter there, Jeff Paul, reporting about CIA Director Bill Burns along with the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=49.64s)]
*  saying they're close. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=57.88s)]
*  We actually have a little bit of that sound. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=59.36s)]
*  We can play you some of what he said. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  Listen here, General. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=62.8s)]
*  I hope profoundly that both of those leaders are going to make that decision because as [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=63.8s)]
*  I said, there's an enormous amount at stake here. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=69.4s)]
*  Do you think that decision has not been made by the two parties? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=71.76s)]
*  Well, I think we will make this more detailed proposal I hope in the next several days and [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=75.88s)]
*  then we'll see. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=81.72s)]
*  General, where do you see things? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=83.2s)]
*  Are we close to a deal or far away? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=84.96s)]
*  There wasn't even one instant where Hamas wanted a deal. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  Hamas is not interested in a deal. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=93.63999999999999s)]
*  Hamas wants a regional war. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=95.72s)]
*  It's hoping that Iran will do what they said they will do. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=98.72s)]
*  If there will be no deal, Iran said they will shoot Israel and this is exactly what Hamas [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=102.6s)]
*  wants. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=107.11999999999999s)]
*  On the 7th of October, when Hamas attacked alone, they hoped that the whole region will [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=108.11999999999999s)]
*  join and they will continue the attack and nobody joined. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=113.56s)]
*  Now they see an opportunity for a multi-front war on Israel. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=118.16s)]
*  They know that a war like that will ease the pressure of Israel in Gaza. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=123.4s)]
*  They have this aspiration for the complete destruction of Israel and this is where they're [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=128.32s)]
*  going to. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=134.88s)]
*  This is why they're not agreeing to any deal. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=135.96s)]
*  They want to survive. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=138.4s)]
*  They want to continue to rule Gaza. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=139.4s)]
*  This is something Israel cannot agree to. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=142.04s)]
*  Israel is not agreeing to an end of the war and therefore they're also not agreeing to [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=144.0s)]
*  any hostage deal. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=149.64s)]
*  General Avivi, I want to take our viewers back, if we can, to that live shot in Tel [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=152.0s)]
*  Aviv's hostage square. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=157.88s)]
*  You can see on a nightly basis now the population there rallying frustrated that there is no [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=159.44s)]
*  ceasefire deal yet. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=166.88s)]
*  Understandably so, the passion we're seeing playing out. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=169.04s)]
*  But you heard in Jeff Paul's report there that one of the sticking points may be this [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=172.96s)]
*  Philadelphia quarter. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=178.0s)]
*  Now Netanyahu has said that's the gateway for Iran into Gaza and it can't be negotiated. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=180.08s)]
*  But do you believe that is the case, that this one strip of land is maybe the sticking [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=187.24s)]
*  point here and how do we get through this? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=192.8s)]
*  I don't think it's the only thing that Hamas is not agreeing to. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=196.95999999999998s)]
*  But I know Philadelphia very well. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=200.55999999999997s)]
*  I was the combat engineer officer of the Gaza Strip and also the deputy division commander [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=203.0s)]
*  of the Gaza Strip. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=207.88s)]
*  And I can say that Philadelphia is crucial. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=209.56s)]
*  There are tens of thousands of rockets and thousands of militants in the Sinai Peninsula [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=212.23999999999998s)]
*  waiting to go into Gaza and reinforce Hamas. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=217.27999999999997s)]
*  And also there is a real danger that those hostages who are not going to be released [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=221.51999999999998s)]
*  are going to be taken out of Gaza to the Sinai Peninsula and from there to Iran. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=227.67999999999998s)]
*  We cannot allow a reality where hostages are taken out of Gaza and we completely lose the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  chance of liberating them. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=239.79999999999998s)]
*  So looking at both the military side and they need to eradicate Hamas as a governmental [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=242.56s)]
*  But also looking at the well-being of the hostages who are not going to be released [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  at this stage, if there will be a deal, we cannot leave Philadelphia corridor. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=254.36s)]
*  In general, 101 hostages you mentioned there and it's a great perspective to understand [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=260.36s)]
*  that the IDF is worried some of them could be taken through that Philadelphia corridor [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=267.04s)]
*  out of Gaza. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=271.12s)]
*  But many of the families holding up signs there in Tel Aviv in these live protests happening [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=272.72s)]
*  now are the faces of some of those hostages that remain. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=278.52s)]
*  Last question for you, just can you give us a sense for just how much political pressure [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=282.36s)]
*  now is this creating inside Israel? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=287.96s)]
*  Well, I think that what is happening is exactly Hamas strategy. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=293.48s)]
*  Hamas believes that if Israel will go into civil unrest, if there will be elections, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=297.0s)]
*  the war will stop. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=304.35999999999996s)]
*  So they are really trying to pressure Israel, the Israeli society. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=305.35999999999996s)]
*  The Israeli society and Jews overall care about every single person. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=310.52s)]
*  It hurts all of us a lot that there are hostages there. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=315.44s)]
*  They know that. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=319.79999999999995s)]
*  But also I think that the government needs to have an overall responsibility for the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=321.28s)]
*  whole society. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=326.23999999999995s)]
*  So we need to bridge between the wind to eradicate Hamas and bring the hostages. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=328.2s)]
*  And at the moment, the only path, the only real path we have is enhance the military [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=334.59999999999997s)]
*  pressure, find the sinew, capturing or killing and destroy the infrastructure of the Hamas [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=339.92s)]
*  as a military organization. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=348.28s)]
*  This is the only chance we really have to release hostages. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=350.36s)]
*  We continue to pray and hope those hostages will be released. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=355.40000000000003s)]
*  Brigadier General Amir Avivi, thank you for your time. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkJurh6c2I&t=358.20000000000005s)]
