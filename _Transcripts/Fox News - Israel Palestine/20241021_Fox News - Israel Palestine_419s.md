# 'ACT OF TREASON': US senators vow to punish top secret document leakers
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4)
*  Top secret American intelligence documents about Israel's possible response to Iran's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=0.0s)]
*  missile attack this month reportedly ending up on the internet. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=7.92s)]
*  And John Kirby has authenticated, he said the documents are real. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=12.4s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal reported that they include Israel's preparations for a strike, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=15.24s)]
*  but not potential targets. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=19.72s)]
*  The document is posted on a site that calls itself independent, but is considered pro-Iran. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=21.76s)]
*  It says that it got a tip about the files and has no connection to the original source. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=26.44s)]
*  We have three Republican senators with us. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=31.76s)]
*  Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, vice chair of the Intelligence Committee, Tom Cotton of [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=34.28s)]
*  Arkansas who serves on intelligence and armed services, and Senator Rick Scott of Florida [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=38.64s)]
*  on armed services and homeland security. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=43.16s)]
*  Today they're all together in Boca Raton, Florida at a get out the vote rally. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=45.52s)]
*  Gentlemen and senators, very good to see you. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=49.68000000000001s)]
*  Thank you very much for being with us today. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=51.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  So Senator Rubio, if I... [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=55.04s)]
*  It's great to be with you. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=56.04s)]
*  It's great to have you all. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=57.04s)]
*  It's great to be with my colleagues. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=58.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=59.04s)]
*  So Senator Rubio, let me start with you and get your reaction to this leak of U.S. intelligence [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=60.04s)]
*  and what it understands about the impending Israeli retaliation against Iran. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=66.28s)]
*  Well, it's both a federal crime to leak that information, it's also an act of treason. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=72.92s)]
*  It's an aiding an enemy of the United States, a government in Iran that basically says death [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=78.48s)]
*  to America, death to Israel. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=82.72s)]
*  Every week, it's their slogan. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=84.52s)]
*  So one of the important reasons why we need to have a majority is that we are in the majority, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=86.2s)]
*  I guarantee you, we will be investigating not just that, but other strategic leaks that [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=89.6s)]
*  have been designed to undermine American foreign policy and in many cases to help avowed enemies [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=93.32s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=97.96s)]
*  That needs to stop, that needs to end. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=98.96s)]
*  We need to know who did this and they need to be punished. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=100.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean... [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  And an enthusiastic response from the crowd there. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=103.47999999999999s)]
*  Senator Tom Cotton, you know, there's a lot of speculation about where this might be coming [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=107.47999999999999s)]
*  from and in the past there have been some strategic leaks of information to Iran and [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  both parties sort of have their ways of dealing with Iran quite differently. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=118.88s)]
*  What is your take on what happened here and how dangerous is it really? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=124.4s)]
*  Well, Martha, without confirming or denying the information that was in this leak, we [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=128.84s)]
*  shouldn't be surprised that we've seen from this administration more than a year's worth [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=135.16s)]
*  of leaks hostile to Israel. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=139.64s)]
*  From the very top to the very bottom, they're packed with people who are hostile to Israel [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=141.56s)]
*  and sympathetic to Iran and its terror networks, from Kamala Harris who puts more pressure [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  on Israel than she does on Iran or her own national security adviser who associates with [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=150.48s)]
*  known Iranian influence agents in the administration, at the State Department, at the Pentagon. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=155.6s)]
*  So we've seen this pattern for a year. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=162.6s)]
*  After this election though, it's going to stop. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=165.44s)]
*  It starts right here in Florida with re-electing Rick Scott but also electing a Republican [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=167.36s)]
*  majority and electing President Trump because we will back Israel to the hilt and we'll [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=170.96s)]
*  make sure that Israel wins. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=176.36s)]
*  Our own Rich Edson just asked Corrine Jean-Pierre about this and she basically, Senator Scott, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=177.96s)]
*  she pushed off to the DOJ and the DOD, the Department of Defense, she said we really [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=185.60000000000002s)]
*  can't answer any questions from the podium about how this information on what Israel [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=192.72s)]
*  may be preparing against Iran, how it got out. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, first off, I think we all have to respect and admire what Netanyahu has done. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=203.07999999999998s)]
*  He hasn't listened to Biden, he hasn't listened to Harris and he's defended his country. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=208.24s)]
*  So we have to respect what he's done and we've got to do everything we can to help him. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=212.51999999999998s)]
*  And I agree with my colleagues, whoever did this has to be held accountable and when we [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=216.2s)]
*  win the majority in the Senate, when Donald Trump is the President, Israel will be supported [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=220.2s)]
*  and we will not ever allow this to happen again. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=224.51999999999998s)]
*  Senator Rubio, I know you're there to support Senator Scott. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=230.56s)]
*  He is in a race that has tightened a little bit. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  Some of the polls show him up by about five, another poll shows him up by only two. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=238.92s)]
*  What's your take on what's happening in Florida? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=244.35999999999999s)]
*  Senator Scott is sitting right there next to you in that race. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=247.4s)]
*  Well, first of all, this is the hardest working person I know in the Senate. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=251.36s)]
*  I can tell you that. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=255.28s)]
*  If our voters work as hard for him as he works for them, he's going to win. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=256.28000000000003s)]
*  He's going to win big. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=259.08s)]
*  But we don't just have to win the presidential race, we have to win these Senate races. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=260.16s)]
*  It starts here in Florida. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=263.52s)]
*  We definitely have to win here. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=264.52s)]
*  This is home territory for us. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=265.56s)]
*  We've got a great Senator. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=267.18s)]
*  We need to keep him there. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=268.18s)]
*  But we need to win these other seats around the country. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=269.18s)]
*  Donald Trump's going to become President if he doesn't have a Senate majority starting [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=271.08000000000004s)]
*  here in Florida, including Texas and other places, keeping what we have. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=274.28s)]
*  But he doesn't have a Senate majority. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=277.2s)]
*  He can't get his people confirmed. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=278.88s)]
*  Chuck Schumer's not going to confirm any of the people that he needs on his team to get [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=280.64s)]
*  his agenda for America done. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=284.44s)]
*  But it begins here. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=286.32s)]
*  And if you're watching from Florida, I encourage you, early voting has started. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=287.32s)]
*  You can go vote in person now today. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=290.71999999999997s)]
*  And if you're one of these people that don't live in Florida but you vote here because [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=293.0s)]
*  you're here part of the year, and you have a ballot sitting in your home, put that thing [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=295.52s)]
*  back because your opinion on this only really matters if you cast that vote for Rick Scott, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=301.04s)]
*  for Donald Trump, and for our whole ticket. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=306.52000000000004s)]
*  Senator Cotton, I know that Senator Rubio just mentioned that tightening race between [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=308.64000000000004s)]
*  Ted Cruz and Colin Allred in the state of Texas. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=314.40000000000003s)]
*  What is your take on what's happening? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=318.72s)]
*  Because I know that you all would love to win West Virginia and hopefully Montana, but [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=320.14000000000004s)]
*  you don't want to lose Texas. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=324.24s)]
*  That's going to put you in a tough position. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=325.9s)]
*  Well, obviously, we want to re-elect all of our great incumbents. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=327.34s)]
*  That starts with Rick Scott right here in Florida, but it's also in states like Texas [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=333.14s)]
*  with Ted Cruz or Nebraska with Deb Fisher. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=336.58s)]
*  I know everyone's focused a lot on the pickup opportunities we have, and we've got a lot [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=339.21999999999997s)]
*  of them, but we've got to make sure that we return our great Republican senators like [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=342.41999999999996s)]
*  Rick Scott, like Ted Cruz, like Deb Fisher. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=346.09999999999997s)]
*  But then we've got to go out and expose all those Democrats who vote 100% of the time [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=348.73999999999995s)]
*  with Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Washington. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=352.78s)]
*  But then they go back to places like Montana for John Tester, Ohio for Sherrod Brown, and [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=355.18s)]
*  act like they're right there with Donald Trump. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=359.18s)]
*  They're his wingman. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=361.1s)]
*  They're fighting alongside of him. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=362.22s)]
*  Don't believe it for a second. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=363.62s)]
*  Get out and vote Republican. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=364.62s)]
*  Final thoughts from Senator Scott? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=365.62s)]
*  Let's say it again. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=367.62s)]
*  Final thoughts from you, Senator Scott. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=368.62s)]
*  You got a lot of support there in that room today, which is clear. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=374.58s)]
*  Well, we're going to have a big win because people are coming out to vote because they [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=377.14s)]
*  know this is the most important election of our lifetime and Donald Trump will be our [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=381.94s)]
*  next president. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=385.46000000000004s)]
*  We'll have a big majority in the Senate and in the House. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=386.46000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=388.66s)]
*  Thank you, guys. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=389.66s)]
*  We're watching those Senate races closely, and the Cook Report just put Pennsylvania [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=390.66s)]
*  into toss-up territory, and Nevada as the lean Republican. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy07GIShgh4&t=394.86s)]
