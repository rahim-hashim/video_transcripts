# 'STUNNING': New video from inside the Hamas terror tunnels
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tni3pncUwFQ)
*  We're back with the Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tni3pncUwFQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Brand new video from inside the Hamas tear tunnels hidden under Gaza's largest hospital. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tni3pncUwFQ&t=2.0s)]
*  Jeff Paul is live in southern Israel with more of the video from the IDF. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tni3pncUwFQ&t=7.4s)]
*  Jeff, this is stunning stuff. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tni3pncUwFQ&t=11.72s)]
*  Yeah, and Griff, I can tell you without question, this has been one of the most active nights [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tni3pncUwFQ&t=14.4s)]
*  since we've been out here in southern Israel. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tni3pncUwFQ&t=20.52s)]
*  And from our vantage point, this war is showing no signs of slowing down. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tni3pncUwFQ&t=22.76s)]
*  You can still hear those booms of the outgoing artillery that Israeli forces continue to [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tni3pncUwFQ&t=25.86s)]
*  fire into northern Gaza. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tni3pncUwFQ&t=31.18s)]
*  And that is where the IDF tonight says they have obtained some new CCTV footage from [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tni3pncUwFQ&t=33.26s)]
*  inside the Sheva Hospital. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tni3pncUwFQ&t=38.1s)]
*  Now Israeli military officials say the video shows two different foreign nationals being [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tni3pncUwFQ&t=39.94s)]
*  forcibly taken to the hospital by Hamas on October 7th. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tni3pncUwFQ&t=45.2s)]
*  The IDF says this is proof that Hamas was using the Sheva Hospital on the day of the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tni3pncUwFQ&t=49.22s)]
*  terror attack. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tni3pncUwFQ&t=54.260000000000005s)]
*  They also released new images of a tunnel Israeli forces say runs underneath the Sheva [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tni3pncUwFQ&t=55.26s)]
*  Hospital complex. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tni3pncUwFQ&t=60.82s)]
*  There appears to be a deep staircase that leads to the entrance of the tunnel shaft, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tni3pncUwFQ&t=62.099999999999994s)]
*  including a blast-proof door and a firing hole. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tni3pncUwFQ&t=66.42s)]
*  But the ongoing fighting in and around Al-Sheva has all but forced the hospital to stop functioning [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tni3pncUwFQ&t=70.22s)]
*  as a medical center. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tni3pncUwFQ&t=75.58s)]
*  At least 31 premature babies were evacuated today and will be sent to Egypt, according [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tni3pncUwFQ&t=76.97999999999999s)]
*  to Palestinian health officials. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tni3pncUwFQ&t=82.53999999999999s)]
*  With resources running low, it's only putting more pressure on a potential hostage deal. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tni3pncUwFQ&t=85.06s)]
*  While Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called reports of a nearing deal incorrect, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tni3pncUwFQ&t=90.22s)]
*  Qatari's prime minister, who's involved in the negotiation, says only minor challenges [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tni3pncUwFQ&t=96.34s)]
*  remain. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tni3pncUwFQ&t=101.54s)]
*  I'm now more confident that we are close enough to reach a deal that can bring the people [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tni3pncUwFQ&t=102.54s)]
*  back to their homes, whether they are the hostages on Hamas side or whatever the exchange [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tni3pncUwFQ&t=112.3s)]
*  that will happen will take place from the Israeli side. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tni3pncUwFQ&t=119.78s)]
*  Now farther to the south and the southern Red Sea, there are reports tonight of a cargo [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tni3pncUwFQ&t=124.82s)]
*  ship that was hijacked by Yemen's Houthi rebels. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tni3pncUwFQ&t=129.62s)]
*  It's important to point out that they don't believe there were any Israelis on board, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tni3pncUwFQ&t=132.54s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a statement basically blaming Iran for what [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tni3pncUwFQ&t=136.98s)]
*  he called an attack. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tni3pncUwFQ&t=141.34s)]
*  Griff? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tni3pncUwFQ&t=142.9s)]
*  All right, Jeff Paul, Live Force in southern Israel. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tni3pncUwFQ&t=143.9s)]
*  Jeff, great coverage. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tni3pncUwFQ&t=145.94s)]
*  Stay safe. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tni3pncUwFQ&t=147.14s)]
