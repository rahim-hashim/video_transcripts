# IDF strikes Lebanon, retaliating after deadly weekend attack by Hezbollah
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [July 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U)
*  In Beirut, Lebanon, explosions as the Israeli Defense Forces retaliate against that deadly [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=0.0s)]
*  strike of the other day in the Golan Heights. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=6.4s)]
*  Our Trey Yankst is live for us in Jerusalem. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=9.0s)]
*  He's got the latest. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=11.36s)]
*  Who was targeted here, Trey? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=12.64s)]
*  Yeah, John, good afternoon. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=15.08s)]
*  Right now we're gathering information following a massive explosion in southern Beirut. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=17.68s)]
*  We understand, according to the Israeli military, this was an airstrike targeting a Hezbollah [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=23.04s)]
*  commander that the Israelis say is responsible for the deaths of those 12 children and teens [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=28.439999999999998s)]
*  in Mashd al-Shamz in the northern part of the Golan Heights on Saturday. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=35.199999999999996s)]
*  Remember, this is how all of it began over the weekend, that Iran made rockets slamming [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=39.28s)]
*  into a soccer field and killing 12 young souls, the Israelis promising that they would respond. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=44.56s)]
*  And it appears this is the response. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=50.44s)]
*  Currently, there are no fresh instructions for Israeli civilians amid a possible retaliation [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=52.96s)]
*  by Hezbollah following this strike in the suburbs of Beirut. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=58.760000000000005s)]
*  But we should note we are getting initial statements from senior Israeli military leadership, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  including Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Galant, who just moments ago tweeted out, quote, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=68.48s)]
*  Hezbollah crossed the red line. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=73.56s)]
*  Now, I've been speaking with Israeli officials throughout the past two days trying to get [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=75.36s)]
*  an understanding of the thought process about how the Israelis would plan to respond to [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=79.4s)]
*  that rocket attack on Saturday that killed those 12 people. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=84.36s)]
*  The top officials we were talking with explained that both the prime minister and the defense [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=88.44000000000001s)]
*  minister traveled to the northern part of the Golan Heights in this Druze village of [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=93.4s)]
*  a population of about 11,000 people. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=98.12s)]
*  And when those two top leaders were there, it was a very emotional moment for them. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=100.84s)]
*  They mourned with the community of Druze individuals. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  This is an area that is controlled by Israel but is not formally part of Israeli territory [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=108.56s)]
*  under international law. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=113.36s)]
*  But it was a moment of what, again, the defense minister is describing a red line that was [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=115.16s)]
*  crossed. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=121.2s)]
*  Earlier today, Hezbollah was continuing rocket and drone attacks into northern Israel. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=122.2s)]
*  They actually killed one civilian. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=126.36s)]
*  And it really illustrates the picture of how violent this group is and how often they've [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  Israel since October 8th, firing thousands of rockets into the northern part of this [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=134.0s)]
*  country. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=139.08s)]
*  But again, what we can report at this hour, there has been an Israeli airstrike in the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=140.08s)]
*  suburbs of Beirut, Lebanon, targeting a senior Hezbollah commander that the Israelis say [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=144.32s)]
*  is responsible for that rocket attack that killed 12 young souls in the Druze village [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=150.28s)]
*  of Majd al-Shamz on Saturday. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=155.8s)]
*  John? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=157.8s)]
*  Trey, it's Sandra here. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=159.60000000000002s)]
*  Obviously, this is breaking news. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=160.60000000000002s)]
*  We're reporting this as it's happening. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=161.60000000000002s)]
*  You are, Trey. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=163.72s)]
*  Thank you for that. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=164.72s)]
*  Crossing the wires right now, Trey, is that the U.S. is to pursue diplomacy to avoid escalation [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=166.12s)]
*  between Israel and Hezbollah. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=171.32000000000002s)]
*  The State Department was just giving a briefing moments ago, said the U.S. will continue pursuing [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=173.68s)]
*  diplomacy to avert escalation in this conflict. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=178.36s)]
*  Here's the direct quote from the State Department spokesperson. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=182.04000000000002s)]
*  We're continuing to work toward a diplomatic resolution that would allow Israeli and Lebanese [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=184.72s)]
*  civilians to return to their homes and live in peace and security. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=189.44s)]
*  We certainly want to avoid any kind of escalation. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=192.92s)]
*  I just want to put that out there, Trey, as you continue reporting from there. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=196.2s)]
*  It's a little late for that statement, and over the past nearly 10 months, Hezbollah [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=203.48s)]
*  has been directly involved in this fight, launching attacks toward Israeli population [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=208.23999999999998s)]
*  centers, and they've even expanded those attacks all along the border between Israel and Lebanon. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  The Israelis have warned time and time again, if these attacks lead to the deaths of civilians, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=219.12s)]
*  they will respond accordingly. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=225.0s)]
*  We're currently in uncharted territory because Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Iran-backed [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=227.07999999999998s)]
*  group Hezbollah in the past, has threatened to target Tel Aviv, the city that we're currently [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=232.44s)]
*  in, if the Israelis target Beirut. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=237.6s)]
*  Again, the defense minister in Israel tonight saying that Hezbollah crossed a red line by [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=240.35999999999999s)]
*  targeting those civilians in Masjid al-Sham over the weekend, and now the question is [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=245.28s)]
*  whether or not Hezbollah will respond and make good on those threats. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=249.76s)]
*  We should put all of this into context, though, in the larger efforts by the Americans to [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=253.84s)]
*  try and de-escalate the situation along the northern border. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=258.0s)]
*  As we speak, there are tens of thousands of Israelis who are internally displaced. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=261.4s)]
*  They are living in hotels in cities like Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=266.38s)]
*  They are displaced from their homes as a result of anti-tank guided missile attacks along [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=270.65999999999997s)]
*  the border and that continuous rocket fire being launched by Hezbollah from southern [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=275.1s)]
*  Lebanon. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=280.21999999999997s)]
*  In addition to that, you have the American efforts underway. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=281.21999999999997s)]
*  Amos Hoechstein, a top adviser to President Biden, has been shuttling messages back and [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=283.86s)]
*  forth between Washington and Beirut, trying to de-escalate the situation, understanding [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=289.02s)]
*  that there are no direct conversations taking place between Hezbollah and the Israelis. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=294.32s)]
*  We should note here, according to all of the reporting that we've done on the ground, Israeli [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=299.09999999999997s)]
*  officials have expressed concern and a lack of confidence in that American-led process [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=303.4s)]
*  to de-escalate the situation along the border. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=310.04s)]
*  They understand that not only are people displaced from their homes, but now the death toll is [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=312.6s)]
*  rising not just among civilians, but also among soldiers that are operating along the [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=317.14s)]
*  border. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=322.36s)]
*  I've been speaking with military officials over the past several weeks, even before that [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=323.40000000000003s)]
*  rocket attack that targeted Mashd al-Shamz, to try and understand if and when there would [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=327.02000000000004s)]
*  be an Israeli operation into Lebanon. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=331.7s)]
*  But I take you back to 2006, the Second Lebanon War. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=334.14s)]
*  The devastation to Lebanon as a country and to Beirut as a capital was so significant [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=337.8s)]
*  that Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, said if he knew that, he would have never [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=343.7s)]
*  attacked Israel. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=348.12s)]
*  And so the question tonight is whether or not Hezbollah will respond to this strike [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=349.58s)]
*  in Beirut, Lebanon, that according to the Israelis, has taken out a senior Hezbollah [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=354.08s)]
*  commander responsible for the deaths of those 12 young Druze civilians over the weekend. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=359.09999999999997s)]
*  John Sandra? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=365.3s)]
*  Okay, Trey Yanks reporting live from northern Israel on that for us. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=366.29999999999995s)]
*  Trey, thank you very much. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=369.65999999999997s)]
*  We're going to check back in with you shortly. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=370.97999999999996s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=372.58s)]
*  Thank you, Trey. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=373.58s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=374.58s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilme. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=375.58s)]
*  And I'm Ainsley Earhart. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gDMHVed95U&t=376.58s)]
