# Trump appears at Oct. 7 remembrance event in Miami, Fla.
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM)
*  in October 7, an event that brings us together here, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=0.0s)]
*  a fraternity of two faiths, Christian and Jewish, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=5.72s)]
*  to mark a dark anniversary, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=10.0s)]
*  a year since October 7, 2023, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  the darkest day of my life, of countless lives. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=18.12s)]
*  It was a day whose horrors unfolded [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=24.8s)]
*  on the other side of the world while America slipped. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=28.88s)]
*  But a year on after Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=35.879999999999995s)]
*  has become a regional struggle [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=40.84s)]
*  against the genocidal and fanatical [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=43.6s)]
*  Islamic Republic of Iran, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=47.04s)]
*  we are all wide awake to its impact on the entire world. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=49.84s)]
*  And the world is looking again for US leadership. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=55.84s)]
*  Many of you will know Admiral Daniel Hagari, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  chief IDF spokesman. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=66.92s)]
*  He has appeared on TV regularly to brief the Israelis [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=69.60000000000001s)]
*  and the American about what's going in Israel [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=74.60000000000001s)]
*  of this terrible and existential war. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=79.60000000000001s)]
*  He said something remarkable the other day on TV [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=84.08000000000001s)]
*  that he is stuck in October 7, 2023. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=89.08000000000001s)]
*  That the hundreds of sunrises and sunsets [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=96.4s)]
*  he has seen since all felt like they were part of the same [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=100.76s)]
*  horrible unending day. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=107.72s)]
*  I understand that we are still learning new details [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=111.5s)]
*  about how 1200 of our brothers and sisters [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=117.34s)]
*  and were kidnapped and tortured and butchered by Hamas [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=123.5s)]
*  and by supposedly innocent Palestinian civilians [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=129.52s)]
*  that you see in the pictures invaded also Israel, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=134.96s)]
*  though they were not part of their army [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=140.24s)]
*  and raped and killed Israeli. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=143.02s)]
*  So these are the innocent people. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=145.84s)]
*  But despite the profound pain, the heartbreak, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  the worry for the 101 blameless children, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=153.84s)]
*  women and men still held hostage in Gaza, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=158.88s)]
*  I am not stuck in this day. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=164.18s)]
*  I am focused on what October 7 means for Jewish history [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=168.1s)]
*  and the Jewish future and the lessons are grim. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=175.26000000000002s)]
*  I am a Chabrit, a native born Israeli. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=181.70000000000002s)]
*  I was raised to believe that the rebirth [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=186.02s)]
*  of this Jewish state marked the beginning of the end [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=189.42000000000002s)]
*  of the global antisemitism that had robbed my parents [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=194.22s)]
*  of their families back in Poland during the World War II. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=199.42s)]
*  As a child, I felt that something bad [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=205.9s)]
*  had happened in Europe, rumors, gossiping. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=212.34s)]
*  But I first learned the facts of the Holocaust [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=217.38s)]
*  when I was just 16 and Israel put the Nazi war criminal [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=221.4s)]
*  Adolf Eichmann on trial because before that, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=227.4s)]
*  our parents wouldn't talk. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=232.28s)]
*  They didn't want to hurt us, they couldn't talk. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=234.48000000000002s)]
*  Still, the survivors who testified during Eichmann trial [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=238.54000000000002s)]
*  sounded like they had come from an entirely aligned reality. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=244.72s)]
*  One of them even referred to the concentration camp, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=250.56s)]
*  planet Auschwitz, like he was in another planet. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=257.32s)]
*  With my late husband Sheldon Zichrono-Livracha, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=262.62s)]
*  I was proud to sit on the board [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=266.64s)]
*  of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=268.52s)]
*  and to sponsor Yad Vashem in Jerusalem. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=274.4s)]
*  We did so mainly in commemoration [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=278.66s)]
*  of our six million martyrs [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=282.26000000000005s)]
*  because we believed in the motto, never again. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=285.54s)]
*  But I lost that belief a year ago, gone forever [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=291.86s)]
*  because what was never meant to happen again happened again. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=298.86s)]
*  Again, Jews suffered a pogrom. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=304.26s)]
*  They were helpless and defenseless. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=309.16s)]
*  They lost their lives and their liberty [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=313.12s)]
*  and their dignity to the bloodthirsty mob [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=316.74s)]
*  whose yields were in Arabic rather than Russian [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=321.40000000000003s)]
*  or Polish or Ukrainian or German. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=327.6s)]
*  And when Israel finally fought back, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=332.02s)]
*  it discovered all too many people in the West [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=335.14s)]
*  who prefer to condemn it rather than Hamas, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=339.9s)]
*  who accused Israel of genocide, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=344.97999999999996s)]
*  who called for Israel to be denied weapons of self-defense, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=348.35999999999996s)]
*  who made Jews feel unwelcome on US college campuses, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=353.82s)]
*  who treated Israelis as if they were war criminals. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=359.78s)]
*  These are the kind of people [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=365.7s)]
*  who allowed the Holocaust to happen [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=368.65999999999997s)]
*  and they are the kind of people [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=371.5s)]
*  who would allow another October 7 to happen, God forbid. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=374.02s)]
*  If there is another October 7, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=381.28s)]
*  it will come with a mushroom cloud. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=384.34s)]
*  The same Iran that armed and funded Hamas in Gaza, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=389.02s)]
*  Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the Houthis in Yemen [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=393.82s)]
*  is working hard to get nuclear bombs [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=398.06s)]
*  with which to finish the job of destroying the Jewish state. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=401.76s)]
*  That must not happen. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=410.14s)]
*  Israel must not let it happen. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=411.74s)]
*  And Israel's friend, most important among them, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=414.86s)]
*  this great United States must not let it happen. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=420.21999999999997s)]
*  I always like to quote a sentence from the Bible. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=425.74s)]
*  And this time, I will say it in Hebrew and translate it. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=439.9s)]
*  Bechol et ohev harayah, v'ach le tzara yevaled. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=444.82s)]
*  A friend loves at all times [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=453.7s)]
*  and a brother is born for adversity. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=456.78s)]
*  Which brings me to our keynote speaker. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=461.3s)]
*  Had he been in the White House a year ago, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=466.86s)]
*  I'm totally convinced that October 7 [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=471.06s)]
*  would have never happened. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=477.06s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=501.06s)]
*  You didn't let me finish the sentence. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=505.9s)]
*  That October 7 wouldn't have happened. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=510.9s)]
*  Hamas would not have dared. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=514.9s)]
*  Hezbollah would not have dared. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=518.74s)]
*  The Houthis would not have dared. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=522.5s)]
*  And yes, the Hayatullah of Iran [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=526.34s)]
*  would never have dared. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=528.94s)]
*  Because evildoers understand [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=531.94s)]
*  when they are faced with a real courage. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=535.94s)]
*  They can spot a strong leader [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=541.1400000000001s)]
*  who will make their lives hell [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=543.7800000000001s)]
*  if they get out of line. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=546.34s)]
*  They, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=548.58s)]
*  they are not afraid of death. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=551.4200000000001s)]
*  They are afraid of death. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=554.4200000000001s)]
*  They, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=556.42s)]
*  they laughed at UN, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=559.0999999999999s)]
*  at UN resolution and at statement condemning [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=562.18s)]
*  both sides of the conflict. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=566.3s)]
*  As long as they are not called out [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=569.5799999999999s)]
*  for what they are, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=572.3s)]
*  every evil, they know they will never suffer consequences. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=574.0999999999999s)]
*  And this man has no problem with calling them out. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=580.14s)]
*  He knows that the enemies of Israel [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=585.1s)]
*  are the enemies of the United States [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=588.62s)]
*  and the free world [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=592.0600000000001s)]
*  because they are the enemies of civilization. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=593.62s)]
*  He knows how to talk tough. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=598.98s)]
*  But more importantly, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=602.46s)]
*  he knows when the time for talk is over [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=604.3000000000001s)]
*  and it is time to fight for what is right. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=608.1s)]
*  He is, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=612.94s)]
*  I'm finishing. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=616.1s)]
*  He is, he is Donald J. Trump, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=617.74s)]
*  the best president America ever had. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=620.86s)]
*  And, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=623.46s)]
*  and the best president America will have again, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=629.0600000000001s)]
*  God willing, come January. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=633.86s)]
*  Please join me welcoming our friend [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=637.94s)]

*  Wow. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=645.38s)]
*  Wow, that was something, huh? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=662.54s)]
*  Thank you very much, Mary. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=664.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=667.02s)]
*  Very special woman, I have to say that, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=675.3s)]
*  friend of mine for a long time. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=677.42s)]
*  And she is very, very special. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=678.78s)]
*  And her husband is, I mean, this was one tough cookie. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=681.54s)]
*  He loved Israel. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=685.14s)]
*  And you talk about special. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=686.8199999999999s)]
*  That was a special man, wasn't he? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=688.22s)]
*  It was great. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=690.02s)]
*  So I want to thank you very much, Mary, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=691.02s)]
*  and for all of the exceptional commitment [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=692.7s)]
*  that you've given to the safety and security [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=695.7s)]
*  and the prosperity of the United States and Israel. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=698.7s)]
*  Before we begin, I would like to tell you [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=703.02s)]
*  that there's a very violent hurricane [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=706.22s)]
*  that's coming down the line. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=708.62s)]
*  And it's a category five, which is something [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=710.74s)]
*  that I've never heard a category five actually coming [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=713.14s)]
*  on to land, but it looks like it's going to. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=715.54s)]
*  And right smack in the middle of Florida. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=718.14s)]
*  Nobody's seen a line like that. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=720.38s)]
*  And it's heading there quickly. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=722.46s)]
*  I have to tell you that I called Miriam. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=723.9s)]
*  I said, I was in New York and I said, Miriam, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=725.7s)]
*  maybe I shouldn't be flying. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=727.9s)]
*  I think I'm the only person that flew down [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=729.38s)]
*  to Florida tonight. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=731.5s)]
*  Because I didn't have a chance with her. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=733.38s)]
*  So, you know, I said, Miriam, maybe I should stay back. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=735.1s)]
*  And, you know, heading into a hurricane, Miriam. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=738.58s)]
*  It made no difference. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=742.38s)]
*  No, no, you have to be here. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=743.38s)]
*  Our friends are there. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=744.74s)]
*  And I said, OK, when you say that, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=745.62s)]
*  I'm going to be there 100 percent. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=747.1800000000001s)]
*  I'm going to be there. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=749.5s)]
*  I was watching the airplane highways [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=754.7s)]
*  and they were all heading this way as I was going that way. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=757.58s)]
*  They said, what's he doing? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=759.7s)]
*  But I wouldn't have missed this. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=762.3s)]
*  Regardless, I wouldn't have missed this for anything. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=763.5s)]
*  This is a very special time and it's a very special day. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=765.54s)]
*  This is the day we have to do it. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=768.42s)]
*  This was the day we had to do it. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=770.18s)]
*  We don't have to postpone it for a week. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=771.4599999999999s)]
*  This is the day because I'm looking forward [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=773.18s)]
*  to coming back and maybe seeing all of these seats filled up [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=775.9799999999999s)]
*  the next time. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=779.9799999999999s)]
*  That's what I want. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=780.74s)]
*  That's what we want. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=784.3399999999999s)]
*  So we're praying for Florida and we hope everyone is safe. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=787.3399999999999s)]
*  And we're playing praying for North Carolina [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=790.86s)]
*  and all of the different places. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=794.0600000000001s)]
*  You look at Georgia and Alabama and Tennessee [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=796.5s)]
*  and South Carolina and Florida. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=799.9000000000001s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=802.58s)]
*  This has been an amazing period of time. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=803.82s)]
*  But the response has been very weak, unbelievably weak. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=805.7s)]
*  Nobody's ever seen such a weak response. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=808.86s)]
*  So we have to get a strong response. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=810.74s)]
*  And now we have another one coming and it looks like it's [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=812.74s)]
*  going to be a whopper. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=814.82s)]
*  I also want to thank Rabbi Kaplun [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=816.62s)]
*  for doing such a great job. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=819.06s)]

*  of one of the darkest hours in all of human history. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=955.5s)]
*  One year ago today, every civilized person [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=959.5799999999999s)]
*  was filled with shock and horror and grief [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=961.82s)]
*  at the news of an evil and so absolute that — [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=964.94s)]
*  and nobody's seen anything like it. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=969.1400000000001s)]
*  Nobody's seen anything that it really can barely be described. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=971.9000000000001s)]
*  You can't describe it. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=975.62s)]
*  October 7th was not just the deadliest day [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=976.74s)]
*  for the Jewish people since the Holocaust. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=979.74s)]
*  It was not just the worst terror attack since 9-11. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=982.0600000000001s)]
*  It was an attack on humanity itself. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=986.86s)]
*  It was a hideous, incredible cruelty. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=989.3399999999999s)]
*  It was chilling savagery. It was demonic delight. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=993.42s)]
*  And the destruction of innocent life on October 7th, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=997.3s)]
*  it seemed as if the gates of hell had sprung open [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1000.54s)]
*  and unleashed their horrors onto the world, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1004.02s)]
*  and that's exactly what happened. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1006.62s)]
*  What a moment in time. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1008.78s)]
*  What a moment in horrible history. Horrible history. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1010.02s)]
*  Today, we mourn more than 1,200 innocent victims [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1012.9s)]
*  of the October 7th attacks, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1017.58s)]
*  whose memory we honor with 1,200 beautiful individual candles, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1020.62s)]
*  and we honor them with grace and with gratitude for their lives [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1026.78s)]
*  and for their families, what their families have gone through. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1031.42s)]
*  And maybe we'll have a moment of silence, please. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1034.02s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1048.58s)]
*  To every family that lost a loved one — [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1051.1s)]
*  I know so many of them — on that terrible day, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1054.1799999999998s)]
*  including several here tonight, we grieve with you, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1057.1399999999999s)]
*  we stand with you, and we make you this sacred vow — [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1059.62s)]
*  very simple vow, a vow you've heard many times, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1065.9399999999998s)]
*  and sometimes it's honored and sometimes it's not. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1068.86s)]
*  But this will be honored never again. Never again. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1071.3s)]
*  The monsters who perpetrated those murders [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1077.62s)]
*  also took over 250 hostages — [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1082.86s)]
*  men, women, and children, including 12 Americans. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1086.3s)]
*  In so doing, they inflicted the most unthinkable torture [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1089.78s)]
*  not only on their captives, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1092.74s)]
*  but also on the families who were forced to live [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1094.26s)]
*  day after day in excruciating agony and pain, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1097.3799999999999s)]
*  not knowing whether their loved ones were dead or alive. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1101.22s)]
*  Can you think of anything worse? [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1105.98s)]
*  Tonight, we send our love to every innocent soul [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1107.66s)]
*  who remains in Hamas' captivity. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1111.14s)]
*  We just are not going to stand for it. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1115.06s)]
*  We're not going to take it. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1117.38s)]
*  We're not going to take it any longer. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1118.54s)]
*  We pray that through the darkness, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1120.66s)]
*  they know that we have not forgotten them, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1123.02s)]
*  that we have not forsaken them. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1125.66s)]
*  We will never forsake them, and we will never abandon them. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1129.66s)]
*  With God's help, they will come safely home, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1133.8600000000001s)]
*  and it will be soon. We hope it will be very soon. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1136.46s)]
*  Very, very soon. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1140.3000000000002s)]
*  And we hope they're safe. Nobody knows. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1141.9s)]
*  I was talking to somebody today, and the family has no idea. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1148.66s)]
*  They think their boy is safe. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1152.0200000000002s)]
*  Beautiful boy. Beautiful young guy. American. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1154.38s)]
*  He went over there to enjoy and to pray, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1157.46s)]
*  and they've never seen him again. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1161.0200000000002s)]
*  But they think he's alive. And can you imagine that? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1163.34s)]
*  Can you even imagine? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1168.1s)]
*  Let me also say to all of the people of Israel [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1169.54s)]
*  who have endured a long year's search of anger and slander [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1171.98s)]
*  and war, our hearts are united with yours. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1176.34s)]
*  We are very united with yours. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1179.1s)]
*  The bond between the United States and Israel [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1181.3799999999999s)]
*  is strong and enduring. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1183.6599999999999s)]
*  And if and when they say — when I'm President, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1184.8999999999999s)]
*  I don't say that. I never say that. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1189.9399999999998s)]
*  If and when I'm President of the United States, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1191.82s)]
*  it will once again be stronger and closer [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1196.8999999999999s)]
*  than it ever was before. We have to win this election. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1199.18s)]
*  If we don't win this election, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1201.78s)]
*  it's tremendous consequence for everything. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1203.74s)]
*  You know, I say that November 5th [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1210.3799999999999s)]
*  will be the most important day in the history of our country. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1212.46s)]
*  I think it will also be the most important day [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1216.42s)]
*  in the history of Israel, if you want to know the truth. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1218.5s)]
*  I believe that. I think you believe that, too. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1221.7s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1223.9s)]
*  Over the past year, there has been an effort by some [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1228.5s)]
*  to deny the horrors of October 7th, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1231.66s)]
*  just as some unbelievably deny the Holocaust itself. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1234.6200000000001s)]
*  And you have that, and you have people that actually say, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1239.22s)]
*  Oh, October 7th, it never happened. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1242.7s)]
*  Where do these people come from? Where do they come from? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1245.42s)]
*  And they don't believe it. They don't believe it. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1248.38s)]
*  They want others to believe it. They don't believe it. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1250.58s)]
*  That's why it's so important to remember [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1252.46s)]
*  and to state clearly for history [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1254.86s)]
*  what happened on that terrible day. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1256.6999999999998s)]
*  The only way we can keep our vow is never again. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1259.8999999999999s)]
*  And it really is to also say never, ever forget. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1263.74s)]
*  We can never forget the nightmare of that day still hands, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1268.46s)]
*  the horrible, the horrible legacy of what's taken place, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1273.5s)]
*  the survivors, the families of the dead, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1278.86s)]
*  and Jews all over the world. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1280.82s)]
*  Hamas raped, tortured, maimed, and murdered innocent civilians [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1283.3s)]
*  in the most barbaric ways imaginable. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1287.1s)]
*  Nobody can believe what they saw. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1289.22s)]
*  And it's there for those to see if you want to see it. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1291.1399999999999s)]
*  It's a terrible thing. I've seen it. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1295.7s)]
*  They parrot-lighted into a music festival [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1299.06s)]
*  full of life and beauty. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1301.86s)]
*  From the skies, they came and massacred young people [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1304.1399999999999s)]
*  who came for joy and happiness and peace. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1307.1s)]
*  They were loving young people, wonderful young people, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1309.9399999999998s)]
*  beautiful people. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1312.8999999999999s)]
*  One young woman whose friend had been killed [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1314.54s)]
*  was seen begging on her knees for her life. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1317.62s)]
*  She was begging, please, please. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1319.6599999999999s)]
*  Her last words were, don't kill me, please don't kill me, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1321.6599999999999s)]
*  before the terrorist shot her dead in the face. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1325.34s)]
*  Elsewhere, a child and an adult were bound together [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1329.2199999999998s)]
*  with metal wire, burned alive. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1332.1s)]
*  A baby was shot through the heart while still in the mother's womb, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1335.46s)]
*  ready to be born and shot. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1339.94s)]
*  Today, we reaffirm the entire world to hear [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1342.74s)]
*  there can be no acceptance, no excuse, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1346.46s)]
*  and no understanding of this kind of evil. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1348.9s)]
*  It's the evil like nobody has ever seen before. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1351.5800000000002s)]
*  Nothing can justify it. Nothing can rationalize it. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1356.18s)]
*  And any person who sympathizes with it, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1359.9s)]
*  with these terrible atrocities as a sickness in their soul [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1363.3s)]
*  and a darkness in their heart, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1366.7s)]
*  and these are people that can never be our allies or our friends, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1368.86s)]
*  almost as shocking as October 7th itself [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1372.82s)]
*  is the outbreak of anti-Semitism [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1375.66s)]
*  that we have all seen in its wake. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1378.82s)]
*  I never thought I was going to see this. Never, ever. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1382.26s)]
*  This is so incredible to be witnessing. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1385.3s)]
*  Whoever thought, we thought this was very, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1387.46s)]
*  very rarified, putrid air. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1391.18s)]
*  We never thought we'd see it, and we certainly never thought [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1395.3000000000002s)]
*  we'd see it in this country. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1397.7s)]
*  And a lot of that has to do with the leadership of this country. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1399.9s)]
*  This attack... [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1404.5s)]
*  Yeah. Well, that's true. We need leadership. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1407.7800000000002s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1413.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1415.5800000000002s)]
*  It's very sad to see. I never thought I'd see it. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1419.22s)]
*  This attack should have rallied the entire world [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1421.46s)]
*  in support of the Jewish people and the Jewish homeland. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1424.3s)]
*  Instead, an ancient scourge of anti-Jewish hatred. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1427.94s)]
*  And this was something we thought was left to hundreds [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1431.8600000000001s)]
*  and thousands of years ago. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1435.54s)]
*  I mean, this was something we never thought could happen. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1436.98s)]
*  The anti-Jewish hatred has returned even here in America, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1439.22s)]
*  in our streets, our media, and our college campuses, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1443.5800000000002s)]
*  and within the ranks of the Democrat Party in particular. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1447.34s)]
*  Not in the Republican Party, I will tell you that. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1451.4199999999998s)]
*  It's not in the Republican Party. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1453.98s)]
*  And I say that the Republican Party has not been infected [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1461.02s)]
*  by this horrible disease. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1464.6999999999998s)]
*  And hopefully it won't be. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1467.22s)]
*  It won't be as long as I'm in charge, I can tell you that. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1468.9399999999998s)]
*  These endless candles, photos, and empty chairs [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1472.3s)]
*  remind us why it's so important that the toxic poison [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1477.3s)]
*  of anti-Semitism be condemned, confronted, and stopped. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1480.8999999999999s)]
*  Anti-Semitic bigotry has no place in a civilized society. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1485.1s)]
*  It has no place in our universities, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1489.02s)]
*  and it has no place in the United States of America. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1491.1399999999999s)]

*  No place. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1496.86s)]
*  Over 2,500 survivors of the Holocaust living in Israel [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1503.6999999999998s)]
*  were directly impacted by the horrors of October 7th. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1508.1s)]
*  Many were forced to flee their homes. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1512.3s)]
*  They cannot believe it happened. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1514.5s)]
*  Some even lost their lives. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1517.02s)]
*  Actually, many lost their lives. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1518.62s)]
*  One of them was Moshe Riddler. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1520.34s)]
*  Moshe was escaped from a concentration camp [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1524.1s)]
*  at the age of 11, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1527.3s)]
*  only to die at the hands of the same vile hate eight decades later. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1528.54s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1534.78s)]
*  Can you imagine his thought process when he saw this happening? [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1536.26s)]
*  Can you even imagine it? [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1539.26s)]
*  Hamas terrorists murdered Moshe at 91 years old [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1541.1799999999998s)]
*  for the same reason the Nazis put him in a camp, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1544.26s)]
*  simply because he was a Jew. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1547.06s)]
*  The world cannot continue down this dangerous path. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1549.46s)]
*  We must stop this perilous slide into conflict, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1552.58s)]
*  hatred and destruction. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1555.42s)]
*  And we must really honestly stop it now. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1557.34s)]
*  It cannot go on because it's going to only get worse if it does. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1559.78s)]
*  The October 7th attack would never have happened if I was president. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1568.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1574.38s)]
*  The past few years have proven that weakness only begets violence and war. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1580.3400000000001s)]
*  And you see that it's weakness, but it's also... [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1584.8200000000002s)]
*  There's a lot of hatred going around also, not just weakness. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1587.5400000000002s)]
*  It's hatred. There's a lot of hatred on a certain side. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1590.9s)]
*  What is needed more than ever is a return of unwavering American leadership [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1594.3000000000002s)]
*  and unquestioned American strength. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1598.7800000000002s)]
*  We were strong. We were powerful. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1601.74s)]
*  We were respected like this country has not been respected in many, many decades, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1603.7s)]
*  just four years ago. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1608.66s)]
*  That's what I intend to deliver as the 47th president of the United States. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1610.98s)]
*  We're going to deliver everything that we want. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1616.18s)]
*  As you know, Hamas has now been severely degraded, [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1623.9s)]
*  and Hezbollah has recently been dealt very, very powerful crippling blows [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1627.18s)]
*  with strength and the right leadership. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1633.18s)]
*  The dawn of a new, more harmonious Middle East is finally within our reach. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1635.3400000000001s)]
*  It's finally within our reach. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1639.98s)]
*  But you have no idea the role that the United States has to play [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1642.9s)]
*  in order to get that ball over the goal line. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1646.8600000000001s)]
*  We have to get it into the end zone. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1650.0600000000002s)]
*  And if it's not the United States, it's not going to happen. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1651.7800000000002s)]
*  It's not going to happen. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1655.38s)]
*  We have to be able to get it done and get it done properly [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1656.74s)]
*  and get back to a wonderful, beautiful way of life. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1660.5s)]
*  You have to be able to do it. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1664.26s)]
*  You have to finish what you began and you have to finish it quickly. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1665.94s)]
*  So here is my commitment to you on the solemn date. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1670.42s)]
*  I will not allow the Jewish state to be threatened with destruction. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1673.5s)]
*  I will not allow another Holocaust of the Jewish people. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1677.62s)]
*  I will not allow a jihad to be waged on America or our allies. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1681.5s)]
*  And I will support Israel's right to win its war on terror [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1686.26s)]
*  and it has to win it fast. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1690.06s)]
*  No matter what happens, it has to go fast. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1692.54s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1695.1399999999999s)]
*  And I want to, while we're at this point, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1712.1399999999999s)]
*  I want to thank Mr. Steve Witkoff, a great entrepreneur [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1714.62s)]
*  in New York and Florida and elsewhere, I think everywhere, frankly. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1718.38s)]
*  But he's made a major contribution. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1721.7s)]
*  So I just want you to know that I think it's appropriate to bring that up. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1723.6200000000001s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1726.5400000000002s)]
*  And Steve is the only one that doesn't really care if I do. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1728.22s)]
*  But he's been very generous. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1730.8600000000001s)]
*  Thank you very much, Steve. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1732.46s)]
*  I appreciate it with his wonderful, beautiful boy here at home. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1733.38s)]
*  I will defend our American Jewish population. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1737.38s)]
*  I will protect your communities, your schools, your places of worship [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1740.42s)]
*  and your values. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1744.8600000000001s)]
*  We will remove the jihadist sympathizers and Jew haters. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1746.34s)]
*  We're going to remove the Jew haters who do nothing to help our country. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1750.94s)]
*  They only want to destroy our country. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1755.74s)]
*  And we will never let the horrors of October 7th be repeated here on Americans. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1758.54s)]
*  We will not let that happen. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1764.34s)]
*  And we will solve the problem that we have. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1765.74s)]
*  If you look at what happened just two days ago in New York City, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1768.1s)]
*  I couldn't believe it. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1772.6599999999999s)]
*  I said, it's starting all over again. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1773.7s)]
*  The level of violence was as bad as it was last summer. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1776.3400000000001s)]
*  If we can achieve all of that, if we can really make sure that those [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1780.38s)]
*  who perished on October 7th will not have died in vain, [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1785.3400000000001s)]
*  they can not have died in vain. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1789.74s)]
*  You cannot let that happen. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1794.1000000000001s)]
*  With God's help, their sacrifice will have given way [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1797.3000000000002s)]
*  to a safer Jewish homeland, a stronger state of Israel, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1800.22s)]
*  a more secure America. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1804.0600000000002s)]
*  And at long last, we will have achieved the dream of some generations. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1805.46s)]
*  We are going to make this. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1810.46s)]
*  We are going to turn this. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1812.3s)]
*  And you can never say a total positive because all of those people that have died. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1813.7s)]
*  But we're going to turn this into something where they can be proud of what's happened. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1819.38s)]
*  They can say, we sacrificed our lives for something very special. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1824.7s)]
*  There has to be unity. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1830.2199999999998s)]
*  There has to be peace. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1831.4599999999998s)]
*  There has to be strength. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1832.5s)]
*  We need so many qualities. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1833.5s)]
*  We need every single quality. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1835.02s)]
*  We're going to bring it all together and we will have peace in the Middle East. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1837.1399999999999s)]
*  We will have strength and resilience and we will have a very powerful and strong Israel. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1841.3s)]
*  And I will be with you all the way. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1848.06s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spc4dm9cJNM&t=1849.8999999999999s)]
