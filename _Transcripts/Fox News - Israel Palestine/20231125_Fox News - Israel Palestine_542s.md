# Israel-Hamas hostage release a lesson for the media, Netanyahu adviser says
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs)
*  Let's go live now to Tel Aviv and Ambassador Mark Roggev. He is senior advisor to Israeli [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=0.0s)]
*  prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli ambassador to the U.K. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=6.0200000000000005s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, let's pick up where we left off with Trey's reporting a moment ago. We [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=11.82s)]
*  hear that your side has now received the list of hostages to be released tomorrow. Can you [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=14.98s)]
*  offer us any comment on the list? I don't know if you've had a chance to see it before [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=21.740000000000002s)]
*  you came on the air. Do you have any reaction? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=25.88s)]
*  I haven't seen it yet, but I have to tell you, when we received the list yesterday, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=28.9s)]
*  we kept it private. We didn't tell anyone except for the families involved, and we asked [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=33.86s)]
*  them to keep it a secret. And we'll probably do the same now. These lists are coming from [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=38.8s)]
*  the Hamas side. We don't put them together. The agreement, though, that the Americans [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=45.28s)]
*  helped us negotiate and we thank the administration for its help, the agreement specifies that [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=50.1s)]
*  over the next over a four day period, we're going to receive 50 hostages. And the focus [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=56.32s)]
*  is on children and women. And that's all I can say. We have to look at the list we received [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=62.739999999999995s)]
*  today and make sure that Hamas is, in fact, keeping its part of the arrangement. And the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  list does include women and children. Mr. Ambassador, did anything about the process [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=74.94s)]
*  that unfolded today take you by surprise or disappoint your side here? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=80.92s)]
*  Well, because we have very low expectations of Hamas, the mere fact that it worked today [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=87.92s)]
*  and we did get 13 Israelis out, that is a pleasant surprise. But there's something very [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=95.2s)]
*  important that has to be said here. Hamas released today six women over the age of 70, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=100.92s)]
*  elderly women, and also at the same time, it released children, a two year old, a four [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=106.8s)]
*  year old, a five year old and a nine year old. Now, Hamas in all its public statements said [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=113.75999999999999s)]
*  their horrendous, horrific attacks of October 7th were against military targets. Their [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=120.12s)]
*  words, not mine. And yet they're releasing today elderly women and children under the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=126.6s)]
*  age of 10, one as young as two years old. What does that say about Hamas's lie that their [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=132.4s)]
*  attack on October 7th was against military targets? And I think there's a lesson here for the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=138.84s)]
*  media and for everybody. You can't take at face value anything Hamas says. They still, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=143.12s)]
*  despite the releases today, deny that they attacked and murdered and kidnapped innocent [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=150.76s)]
*  civilians on October 7th. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=157.07999999999998s)]
*  Why is it, sir, in your estimation that Hamas decided to prioritize the release of elderly [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  women and young children, certainly not for humanitarian reasons, as they have claimed? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  What's your assessment there of the strategic reasons behind the decision? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=171.48s)]
*  Well, first of all, you're 100% correct. Hamas has not become a moral organization, has not [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=175.72s)]
*  become a humanitarian organization. They're not new boy scouts. Yes, they are a vicious, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=180.51999999999998s)]
*  brutal, fanatical terrorist organization. And we saw the sort of violence that they [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=186.04000000000002s)]
*  perpetrated on October 7th when they invaded my country and they burned babies alive. And they [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=191.16000000000003s)]
*  massacred entire families and they lined up the young people at the open air music concert and [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=197.52s)]
*  they just machine gunned them. Terrible things, beheadings, rapes, terrible, terrible crimes [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=202.76000000000002s)]
*  against humanity. So they haven't changed who they are. They are despicable and they are really [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  enemies of all humanity. But if they have decided to cooperate in the release of hostages, it's [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=218.35999999999999s)]
*  because of the pressure they're under. And who is applying that pressure? The brave young men and [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=224.68s)]
*  women of the Israeli Defense Forces are soldiers who have been delivering blow after blow. They are [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=230.2s)]
*  taking apart Hamas's military machine. They're eliminating Hamas's command structure. And Hamas [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=236.48s)]
*  is desperate for a timeout. They want to see an end to the blows that the Israeli military is [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=242.39999999999998s)]
*  inflicting on them. And they know, because we've said it publicly over the last month, we will only [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=248.16s)]
*  agree to this sort of humanitarian pause if they release hostages. So we force them to release the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  hostages. That's a good thing. Mr. Ambassador, two surprise developments, or at least a surprise [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=260.32s)]
*  for the American public, seemingly for the American government as well. That is that no Americans were [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=268.0s)]
*  released. We had initially been under the impression that three would be released potentially [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=275.2s)]
*  today. Also the release of these additional hostages, 12 Thai nationals as well as one [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=280.24s)]
*  Filipino included in that 12 number. Any sense of what went on with either of those developments? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=286.72s)]
*  Do you have any sense of why that occurred? Was your side taken by surprise by that? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=293.6s)]
*  We weren't taken by surprise. We know that the Thais were speaking directly to the Iranians. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=299.12s)]
*  And as you know, Iran is the primary funder of Hamas. Out of the 95 percent, no, sorry, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=305.68s)]
*  93 percent of Hamas's military budget comes from Tehran, from the Islamic Republic of Iran. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=312.0s)]
*  It's part of their axis of terror, which includes Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Khutis [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=319.52s)]
*  in Yemen. That's the axis they belong to. And it's clear that if Iran asks Hamas to do something, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=326.8s)]
*  they will do it. On the question about the Americans, I'm hopeful that we'll still see [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=335.6s)]
*  that young American girl freed. She fits into all the categories. She's young. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=341.12s)]
*  She needs to be prioritized. And I hope that she gets out very, very soon. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=347.6s)]
*  The president, President Biden said a few moments ago that he suspects October 7th happened when [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=354.32s)]
*  it did because he was getting very close. The U.S. was getting very close to a peace [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=361.12s)]
*  bridge with Saudi Arabia. Do you share that assessment? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=366.64s)]
*  We do indeed. The president is right. We have no doubt that one of the reasons that Hamas [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=370.32s)]
*  launched its attack on October 7th was its fear that Israel and Saudi Arabia were about to [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=376.0s)]
*  normalize relations and establish peaceful ties between the two countries. And while the whole [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=381.76s)]
*  world, yes, in America, in Canada, in Europe, everyone supports that sort of peace breakthrough [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=388.0s)]
*  in the Middle East. For Hamas, for Iran, for Hezbollah, for the axis of terror, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=393.76s)]
*  that sort of peace breakthrough is an existential threat because why we all want to see peace and [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=400.4s)]
*  progress and prosperity and cooperation, they, Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah, they want to see a new [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=406.08s)]
*  dark age. They want to see the Middle East turn inward into this era of fanaticism, of extremism, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=414.48s)]
*  of taking us back to a dark period in history. No, we have to defeat them. We have to unite with the [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=423.12s)]
*  moderate and pragmatic Arab countries. We have to form a pro-Western, pro-peace, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=431.04s)]
*  pro-cooperation alliance. That's what we stand for, and we have to defeat Hamas. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=436.56s)]
*  I need to ask you before I let you go, wondering if you have any concerns that [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=442.8s)]
*  as Hamas releases hostages, those people who remain in captivity [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=447.84s)]
*  potentially become more valuable hostages to the terror organization? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=454.32s)]
*  So you're right in your question yet again, because if we celebrated today the release of 13, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=460.24s)]
*  and the expectation is over the next three days we'll see another 37 hostages released, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=466.32s)]
*  and that is the deal. They have to release 50 in the first four days. There are still over 100 [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=472.0s)]
*  left behind. So it's bittersweet. Well, we're happy for the families of those who've seen their loved [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=478.88s)]
*  ones return. We're with the families of those who've still got loved ones stuck in Gaza, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=484.16s)]
*  prisoners of these terrible Hamas terrorists. And let me say here, we will not rest. We will not [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=491.6s)]
*  rest until every last hostage is released. It's an integral part of our military operation, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=498.48s)]
*  the release of the hostages, and we will continue to apply military pleasure on Hamas. All the [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=504.56s)]
*  hostages will come home. Mr. Ambassador, thank you for taking time with us on this very important [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=511.92s)]
*  day. We really appreciate it. Thank you for having me. Hi everyone, I'm Brian Kilmeade. I want you to [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGoP0q2RTs&t=520.0s)]
