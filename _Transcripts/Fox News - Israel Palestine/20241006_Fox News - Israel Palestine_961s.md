# Tim Walz dodges big question on whether Israel has right to strike Iran
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I)
*  Joining us now, Democratic vice presidential nominee, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=0.0s)]
*  Governor, great to have you with us on Fox News Sunday. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=4.14s)]
*  Great to be with you, Shannon. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=8.1s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=9.1s)]
*  OK, so I want to pick up where Alexis left off there in the Middle East, because you [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=10.1s)]
*  were asked in the debate the other night a question about whether or not you would support [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=13.08s)]
*  a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=16.5s)]
*  You didn't really get to an answer on that. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=19.34s)]
*  So this administration continues to call for Israel to moderate its response after being [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=21.1s)]
*  attacked by Iran. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=26.22s)]
*  Do you now think that Israel has a right to either strike oil facilities, nuclear facilities? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=27.8s)]
*  What's your position on that? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=32.24s)]
*  Well, look, let's remember how this started. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=33.92s)]
*  And we're approaching tomorrow a tragic anniversary. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=36.92s)]
*  Hamas terrorists murdered over 1200 innocent Israelis, 46 Americans took hostages. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=39.72s)]
*  We have been clear Israel has the right to defend itself. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=48.86s)]
*  We've always stood in that position. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=51.64s)]
*  We need the hostages returned and we need to bring an end to the humanitarian crisis [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=53.32s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=57.800000000000004s)]
*  But again, the point is it's Iran is at the heart of this and their proxies that bring [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  disruption throughout the region. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=63.720000000000006s)]
*  That's why being in the Situation Room as vice president was working with Israelis to [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=65.44s)]
*  repel the attack we saw this week. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=71.02000000000001s)]
*  They tried it back in April, the same thing. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=72.9s)]
*  And that's the point of being and boxing Iran in. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=75.46000000000001s)]
*  President Trump tore up the nuclear deal that moved Iran closer to a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=79.48s)]
*  He also allowed Iran to shoot down an American aircraft in international airspace with a [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=85.02s)]
*  tweet. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=89.58s)]
*  And when Iranian weapons, missiles fell on U.S. troops, he called it a headache when [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=90.58s)]
*  his traumatic brain injury. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=95.02s)]
*  Just to be clear, we have always said we reserve the right to protect American troops, our [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=96.3s)]
*  allies in the region, and that there is consequences for Iran. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=101.74s)]
*  So what you're seeing right now is the ability to work with our allies, the ability to make [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=105.14s)]
*  not further and every administration has dealt with them for 45 years. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=110.64s)]
*  Now it's to make sure and there has never been a question. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=115.72s)]
*  Israel has the right to defend itself and we stand with them to do that. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  But we need to bring this to a conclusion. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=122.16s)]
*  Does that include a strike on Iran's nuclear or oil facilities? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=124.0s)]
*  Specific operations will be dealt with at the time. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=130.76s)]
*  But being very clear on this, Iran, there is consequences for what they do. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=133.04s)]
*  That's what's happening right now. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=137.1s)]
*  Israel's right to defend itself is not in question. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=138.88s)]
*  Okay, you said in a radio interview that anti-Israel protesters were speaking out, quote, for all [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=140.96s)]
*  the right reasons. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  You know that some of them are carrying Hamas flags, some of them are calling for the extermination [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=146.88s)]
*  of the Jewish state. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=151.32s)]
*  Do you want to clarify your praise for them? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=152.32s)]
*  Yeah, I'm certainly not talking about them. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=156.51999999999998s)]
*  I'm talking about the people who understand that we have to end the humanitarian crisis, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=158.8s)]
*  but they understand we need to return the hostages, bring peace to the region. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=164.72s)]
*  Look, I will always defend people's rights to First Amendment, but that's not the folks [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=167.95999999999998s)]
*  I'm talking about. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=172.04s)]
*  Those folks are not speaking for the entire group. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=173.04s)]
*  So I think it's very clear on this. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=175.39999999999998s)]
*  Israel's right, as we've stood with them, anti-Semitism has no place in this country. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  And Vice President Harris has been clear about that. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=181.88s)]
*  I've been clear about it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=184.11999999999998s)]
*  But the ability to bring a peaceful solution and understand Israel's right to defend itself, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=185.94s)]
*  the return of the hostages, and Gaza's right to live in peace too is something that we're [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=191.04s)]
*  trying to get to. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=197.52s)]
*  And that's going to take the leadership that we've seen out of Vice President Harris, bringing [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=198.52s)]
*  able to hold this coalition together. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=202.2s)]
*  And again, when Iran launched their missiles this week, she's in the situation room. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=204.58s)]
*  That's different. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=209.48s)]
*  The people who are in the situation room with Donald Trump, like John Kelly, his chief of [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=210.48s)]
*  staff, said he shouldn't be there. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=213.7s)]
*  He's a damaged human being. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=215.94s)]
*  His own defense secretary said he does not understand the situation and is incapable [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=217.48s)]
*  of dealing with it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=221.7s)]
*  So it's about character. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=222.7s)]
*  Let's focus on what your position is and the Vice President's position as well. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=224.73999999999998s)]
*  I want to talk about abortion too, because this came up at the debate. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=227.73999999999998s)]
*  It's been a winning argument for Democrats on many ballots, but I want to clarify what [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=230.7s)]
*  the law is there in Minnesota. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=234.62s)]
*  Abortion Finder, a website that helps women find access, says abortion is legal throughout [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=236.66s)]
*  pregnancy in Minnesota. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=240.73999999999998s)]
*  There is no ban or limit on abortion in Minnesota based on how far along in a pregnancy you [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=242.01999999999998s)]
*  are. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=247.54s)]
*  You signed the bill that makes it legal through all nine months. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=248.54s)]
*  Is that a position you think Democrats should advocate for nationally? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=251.08s)]
*  Look, the Vice President and I have been clear the restoration of Roe v. Wade is what we're [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=254.16000000000003s)]
*  asking for. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=259.64s)]
*  But that law goes far beyond Roe v. Wade. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=260.64s)]
*  The law is very clear. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=263.64s)]
*  It does not change that. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=265.04s)]
*  That has been debunked on every occasion. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=266.04s)]
*  But wait, let's agree. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=268.04s)]
*  What you signed is there's not a single limit through nine months of pregnancy. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=270.04s)]
*  Roe had a trimester framework that did have limits through the pregnancy. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=273.6s)]
*  The Minnesota law does not have that. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=277.36s)]
*  This puts the decision with the woman and her health care providers. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=280.3s)]
*  The situation we have is when you don't have the ability of health care providers to provide [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=283.26s)]
*  that, that's where you end up with a situation like Amanda Zaworski in Texas, where they [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=288.1s)]
*  are afraid to do what's necessary. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=292.40000000000003s)]
*  This doesn't change anything. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=295.14s)]
*  It puts the decision back on to the woman, to the physicians. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=296.82s)]
*  And we know that this is simply something to be brought up to be very clear. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=300.88s)]
*  Donald Trump's asking for a nationwide abortion ban. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=304.74s)]
*  He has said repeatedly that he will not sign a national abortion ban. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=307.18s)]
*  Are you calling that just a flat out lie? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=311.74s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=314.3s)]
*  And Senator Vance has in the past said so too. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=316.86s)]
*  Now look, they may see this as an election issue. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=320.7s)]
*  We see it as a right of women to make their own bodily decisions. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=323.62s)]
*  And that's what the states like my state have the ability to put that in. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=327.1s)]
*  States like Georgia force women to cross the border and then we have a death of Amber Thurmond. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=330.94s)]
*  So let's be very clear, trying to cut hairs on an issue on this is not where the American [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=337.46000000000004s)]
*  public's at. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=341.90000000000003s)]
*  They want the restoration of Roe v. Wade. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=342.90000000000003s)]
*  Vice President Harris said she would sign it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=345.18s)]
*  That's what we'll do when we're elected. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=346.86s)]
*  But to be clear, the Minnesota law is far beyond Roe v. Wade. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=347.86s)]
*  And about the Amber Thurmond case in Georgia, her family has, and it's tragic, she is a [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=351.1s)]
*  young mother who left behind a young son. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=354.94s)]
*  But what her family has said is it was a complication from an abortion pill that she received and [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=357.86s)]
*  she didn't get proper care when she went to a Georgia hospital, which had multiple opportunities [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=362.22s)]
*  to intervene there. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=367.46000000000004s)]
*  Her own attorney, the family's attorney says it wasn't the Georgia law. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=368.94000000000005s)]
*  It was the hospitals. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=372.20000000000005s)]
*  What he claims is malpractice, not treating her when she clearly showed up in distress [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=373.38000000000005s)]
*  and still had the byproducts of her pregnancy because of that rare complication from the [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=377.98s)]
*  abortion pill. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=382.1s)]
*  So just to be clear on the Georgia law and how her family and her attorney sees it. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=383.1s)]
*  I think they also indicated that had she not go to North Carolina after the debate [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=387.82s)]
*  the other night, that she would have been in a better position. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=392.12s)]
*  So look, these are the situations you're going to get into when you take this decision and [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=394.84s)]
*  put it at the hands of politicians like Donald Trump rather than women and their doctors. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=399.18s)]
*  We trust women. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=403.34s)]
*  We trust doctors. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=404.53999999999996s)]
*  And we know the outcomes of that are better. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=405.53999999999996s)]
*  OK, let's clarify more changes that you signed in Minnesota as well. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=407.58s)]
*  Several things were repealed with respect to reporting infants who may have survived [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=412.21999999999997s)]
*  an abortion attempt. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=416.3s)]
*  Language that used to be part of the statute was taken out. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=418.06s)]
*  We'll put this on the screen so people can see it used to require medical personnel to [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=420.1s)]
*  quote preserve the life and health of the born alive infant. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=424.02000000000004s)]
*  That language has been repealed. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=428.98s)]
*  It's no longer part of the law. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=430.18s)]
*  Also struck from the law was language about reporting infants that are born alive, what [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=432.08000000000004s)]
*  treatment they receive and whether they live or die. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=436.74s)]
*  Why was it important to you to get that protection out of the law? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=439.90000000000003s)]
*  The law aligns with every other case of what physicians are required by their ethical responsibilities. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=446.5s)]
*  And so it changed nothing other than aligning with all care that physicians provide in any [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=451.34s)]
*  circumstance for any medical case. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=456.46s)]
*  And so its alignment as it's always been, it's the cases we've seen in Minnesota, the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=458.9s)]
*  outcomes we get in our health care results are the best in the nation. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=464.85999999999996s)]
*  And all it did was align with existing law. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=468.46s)]
*  But you do acknowledge it takes out the language about preserving the life of an infant who [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=471.53999999999996s)]
*  was born alive. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=474.94s)]
*  Every doctor has an ethical responsibility to provide what they can in each situation. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=477.5s)]
*  That is the way the law is written. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=482.14s)]
*  Now, it's the same for any person who shows up. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=483.38s)]
*  And again, this is a distraction from the real issue here is is women being forced into [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=485.90000000000003s)]
*  miscarriages, women being forced to go back home, get sepsis, potentially die like we [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=491.42s)]
*  saw in cases in Texas. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=497.36s)]
*  And maternal mortality rates in Texas have skyrocketed off the charts because of this. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=498.94s)]
*  This is bad policy. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=505.38s)]
*  Vice President, I have been very clear on this. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=506.78s)]
*  We will restore the rights of Roe vs. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=508.78s)]
*  Wade. We will make sure women have their health care decisions. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=510.73999999999995s)]
*  We will not put people's lives at risk because of the geography of where they live. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=513.34s)]
*  And it will go back to the way it was before Donald Trump gleefully said, we've got the [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=517.14s)]
*  best of both worlds here. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=522.62s)]
*  Things are wonderful. The states are handling it. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=523.86s)]
*  It's a beautiful thing. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=525.8199999999999s)]
*  It's not a beautiful thing to see women dying. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=526.9s)]
*  It's not a beautiful thing to put doctors at risk of being imprisoned. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=528.94s)]
*  It is not. It is not to see any single woman suffer. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=532.02s)]
*  And by the way, there's not a single state, no matter how pro-life or restrictive their [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=535.42s)]
*  laws are, that do not allow a doctor to intercede. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=538.74s)]
*  That's true in Georgia and Texas as well. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=542.1s)]
*  I want to turn to the economy. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=543.78s)]
*  Our latest polling shows that 66 percent of Americans we talked to said that buying [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=545.46s)]
*  groceries is a, quote, major problem for them. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=549.26s)]
*  And when we ask people about how they feel about the policies of this administration [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=552.34s)]
*  versus the previous, double the amount of people surveyed say that Biden-Harris policies [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=556.42s)]
*  have hurt them rather than help them and their families economically. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=561.2199999999999s)]
*  That's in stark contrast to how they feel when asked about the Trump administration. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=564.9399999999999s)]
*  So what would a Harris-Waltz administration do different than a Biden-Harris administration [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=568.6999999999999s)]
*  when it comes to convincing people that the economy is going to get better for them because [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=574.14s)]
*  their perception is that it's not? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=578.62s)]
*  Well, we saw a blockbuster jobs report this week. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=581.6999999999999s)]
*  We saw interest rates come down. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=584.74s)]
*  And we've also seen that Vice President Harris laying out a middle class agenda. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=586.1400000000001s)]
*  Look, I was in Ohio yesterday in Cleveland, in Cincinnati, and talking about this. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=590.1400000000001s)]
*  Folks in folks in Ohio know that Donald Trump's policies led to one hundred and eighty [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=595.46s)]
*  thousand manufacturing jobs leaving. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=599.1400000000001s)]
*  They understand when he left office, we had more people unemployed percentage wise than [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=601.1s)]
*  the Great Depression. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=605.1800000000001s)]
*  What Vice President Harris is talking about is making it more affordable to buy housing. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=606.22s)]
*  And we've seen it in Minneapolis. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=610.3000000000001s)]
*  When you have more housing stock, we've seen rates go down. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=611.78s)]
*  We've seen more houses available. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=614.66s)]
*  Also, the idea of price gouging with 37 states, Republican and Democratic states have this. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=616.26s)]
*  Corn is about four, ten or so a bushel. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=621.26s)]
*  That's that's where it's been for many years up and down. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=624.86s)]
*  But prices at the grocery stores have skyrocketed. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=628.22s)]
*  Corporate profits have skyrocketed and people are paying more. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=630.98s)]
*  So we talk about that. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=633.9s)]
*  And then I think the fundamental difference here is to as Donald Trump kept his promise, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=635.1s)]
*  he cut taxes for the wealthiest. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=638.94s)]
*  She's talking about making sure things like a child tax credit, six thousand dollar child [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=641.2199999999999s)]
*  tax credit, put more money in people's pocket, making sure that we're able to buy those [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=644.9799999999999s)]
*  things, whether it's a crib or it's baby formula, get started. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=649.18s)]
*  And she's simply asking that we can pay for it by asking those at the top to pay their [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=652.06s)]
*  fair share. This is a this a fundamental difference in approaches to it. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=656.42s)]
*  And we're seeing it working. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=660.42s)]
*  We're seeing economists talk about Donald Trump's proposal to add a 20 percent sales tax [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=662.18s)]
*  will cost four thousand dollars. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=667.02s)]
*  That's everybody. That's not me saying it. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=668.3s)]
*  And just to note, that is a tariff, which, by the way, this administration not only kept [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=670.3399999999999s)]
*  most of the Trump terrorists, but they added their own as well. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=674.38s)]
*  So that's got to be part of the conversation. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=676.66s)]
*  Want to talk a little bit about your record as governor, because it's elucidates for people [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=678.54s)]
*  how you may serve as whether you end up being the president. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=682.74s)]
*  You'll be one heartbeat away should your ticket be successful. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=685.18s)]
*  Wall Street Journal says this after you were chosen to join the ticket. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=688.8599999999999s)]
*  As the Democratic governor of Minnesota, Tim Waltz signed into law initiatives allowing [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=691.9399999999999s)]
*  immigrants in the country illegally to apply for driver's licenses, qualify for free [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=696.02s)]
*  tuition at state universities and enroll in the state's free health care program for [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=700.66s)]
*  low income residents. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=705.1s)]
*  Are those not magnets to draw people here many times on dangerous journeys for themselves? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=707.1800000000001s)]
*  And why should your taxpayers in Minnesota or across the states pay for those programs? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=712.62s)]
*  Well, that's not the vice president's position, but I will say this. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=718.7s)]
*  Minnesota ranks as a top five business state. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=721.58s)]
*  We rank as a top three state for children living and with a top state for health care [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=724.38s)]
*  access. I would also add this. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=729.6999999999999s)]
*  We also have some of the safest roads. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=731.2199999999999s)]
*  Look, the vice president has made it clear that she has policies that make a difference. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=732.9399999999999s)]
*  Her border policies are the most strongest, the fairest we've seen. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=737.0999999999999s)]
*  Now, governor, you know, a lot of people, including your own party, would not join that [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=742.2199999999999s)]
*  statements. There are millions of people who have come here over the last few years that, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=746.3s)]
*  you know, they see this as an open border. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=751.18s)]
*  Policies. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=753.54s)]
*  Well, simply we have a policy. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=755.82s)]
*  Donald Trump sees it as a political. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=757.78s)]
*  Look, James Langford in Oklahoma, the Border Patrol agents, the Wall Street Journal, the [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=759.5s)]
*  Chamber of Commerce all said pass this legislation. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=764.9399999999999s)]
*  You have to have Congress to authorize 1500 new border agents. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=768.14s)]
*  You have to have Congress to authorize DOJ to speed adjudications on these asylum claims. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=771.34s)]
*  Those are things that would actually work. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=776.34s)]
*  Donald Trump told us for four years he would deal with this. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=778.02s)]
*  He didn't. He didn't build his wall. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=780.9s)]
*  Two percent. Mexico didn't pay for it. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=782.3s)]
*  This is a real bill that has bipartisan support. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=784.54s)]
*  It has the experts on board and it starts to tackle these issues. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=788.5s)]
*  And we don't have to resort to demonizing people. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=791.9799999999999s)]
*  We don't have to resort to to to making up our crafting stories. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=794.9799999999999s)]
*  As Senator Vance said, he did. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=799.42s)]
*  Those things were not happening in Springfield, but it doesn't mean that we can't pass a piece [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=800.9399999999999s)]
*  of legislation to strengthen our border. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=805.14s)]
*  That's what Kamala Harris is talking about. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=807.18s)]
*  Well, she's talking about solving the problem. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=808.74s)]
*  That piece of legislation does include the wall that you guys have been so you've [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=810.42s)]
*  disparaged that. I mean, the vice president has as well. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=815.02s)]
*  So I don't know if she really intends to move forward with that. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=817.4599999999999s)]
*  But it was negotiated by three or four senators and many Republicans came out against it [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=820.14s)]
*  long before President Trump indicated he didn't like it either. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=824.14s)]
*  Listen, before we go, because I wish that we had a full hour. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=827.06s)]
*  I want to give you a chance because you called yourself a knucklehead this week to talk [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=829.3s)]
*  about some of your misstatements. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=832.9s)]
*  You've modified your story or explained that you misspoke about things involving your [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=835.02s)]
*  military rank, about carrying a weapon in war, your 1995 DUI arrest, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=838.78s)]
*  using IVF to have your beautiful children, Gus and Hope, being in Hong Kong and China [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=844.26s)]
*  in the summer of 1989 during the Tiananmen events. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=849.26s)]
*  A lot of people would say they couldn't get away with saying, I'm just too passionate. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=853.5s)]
*  My grammar is not right. I'm a knucklehead. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=856.74s)]
*  What do you say to the American people who think I don't know that I can trust this [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=859.02s)]
*  guy with all those modifications to be the potential commander in chief of this country? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=863.18s)]
*  Yeah, well, I think they heard me. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=869.3s)]
*  They heard me the other night speaking passionately about gun violence and [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=870.54s)]
*  misspeaking. And I got to be honest with you, Shannon, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=873.74s)]
*  I don't think people care whether I used IUI or IVF when we talk about this. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=876.6999999999999s)]
*  What they understand is Donald Trump would resist those things. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=881.4599999999999s)]
*  Look, I speak passionately. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=884.26s)]
*  I had an entire career decades before I was in public office. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=885.9s)]
*  They know and I'm very proud of my 24 years in service and my record. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=889.98s)]
*  I have never disparaged someone else in this, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=894.4599999999999s)]
*  but I know that's not what Donald Trump does. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=896.82s)]
*  They disparage everyone, their personal attacks. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=898.82s)]
*  I will own up when I misspeak. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=901.1400000000001s)]
*  I will own up when I make a mistake. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=902.94s)]
*  Let's be very clear on that debate stage. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=904.34s)]
*  The other night I asked one very simple question and Senator Vance would not [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=906.5s)]
*  acknowledge that Donald Trump lost the 2020 election. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=910.1s)]
*  I think they're probably far more concerned with that than my wife and I used [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=912.7s)]
*  IUI to have our child and that Donald Trump would restrict that. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=916.0600000000001s)]
*  So I think folks know who I am. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=919.38s)]
*  My constituents here in Minnesota have elected me eight times. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=921.1s)]
*  They know where I'm at and and I'm proud to be on the ticket and will deliver [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=924.5s)]
*  just like we have here in Minnesota. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=928.1800000000001s)]
*  And if we're going to deal in truth, both the president, the former president [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=929.5400000000001s)]
*  and his nominee have said that they are very supportive of IVF. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=932.94s)]
*  We are glad you have your precious family. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=936.1s)]
*  We thank you for serving in uniform and your years and decades as a teacher. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=937.58s)]
*  My mom was, too. I know it's really hard work and sometimes very thankless. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=941.3000000000001s)]
*  So, Governor, we appreciate your time. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=944.5s)]
*  Thanks, Shannon. Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0fP6m1vg3I&t=947.74s)]
