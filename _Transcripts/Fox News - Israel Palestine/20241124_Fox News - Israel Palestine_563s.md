# Incoming NSA flags concerns over Russia-Ukraine war: 'Where is this escalation going?'
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE)
*  Joining us now is Florida Congressman and incoming National Security Advisor Mike [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=0.0s)]
*  Waltz. He is the first combat decorated green beret ever elected to Congress. Congratulations, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=4.0s)]
*  sir, on your new appointment. National Security Advisor is a tremendous job. It's going to see [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=9.52s)]
*  you working every single day just down the hall, maybe 100 feet or so from the commander-in-chief. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=14.64s)]
*  So let's go ahead and dive right into foreign policy, the big topics of the day. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=21.2s)]
*  President Biden, as you know, this week approved Ukraine's use of U.S.-made long-range missiles [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=25.76s)]
*  in Russia, which they immediately deployed. Russia then responded by using a new kind of [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=31.68s)]
*  experimental ballistic missile with multiple warheads. Take a listen to the Pentagon. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=37.36s)]
*  This was a new type of lethal capability that was employed on the battlefield. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=43.28s)]
*  So that's certainly of concern to us. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=48.8s)]
*  The modern air defense systems in the world and the anti-missile defenses created by the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=51.36s)]
*  Americans in Europe do not intercept such missiles. Congressman, was this a good move [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=56.559999999999995s)]
*  by the Biden team this week, and how concerned are you about this new Russian weapon on the battlefield? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=62.31999999999999s)]
*  Well, thanks, Jillian. Thanks for having me on. Look, this is a clear escalation, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=71.6s)]
*  and the concern has been, where is this escalation going? This was in response to, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=78.96s)]
*  in large part, to North Korea sending troops. We've now responded by allowing these strikes [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=85.11999999999999s)]
*  deeper into Russia. I want to be clear that they are hitting things like supply depots and airfields [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=92.16s)]
*  and pushing the Russian offensive back. They're not going all the way to Moscow or St. Petersburg, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=99.12s)]
*  but where is all of this escalation going? Now, South Korea is talking about somehow getting [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=105.76s)]
*  involved, and President Trump has been very clear about the need to end this conflict. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=111.76s)]
*  And so what we need to be discussing is who's at that table, whether it's an agreement, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=118.80000000000001s)]
*  an armistice, how to get both sides to the table, and then what's the framework of a deal. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=125.44s)]
*  That's what we'll be working with this administration until January and then beyond. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=132.0s)]
*  And I also want to be clear on one thing, Jillian. Jake Sullivan and I have had discussions, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=137.20000000000002s)]
*  we've met. For our adversaries out there that think this is a time of opportunity, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  that they can play one administration off the other, they're wrong. And we are hand in glove. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=150.4s)]
*  We are one team with the United States in this transition. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=158.39999999999998s)]
*  JILLIAN O'COURT, The Washington Post, The Washington Post. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=161.92s)]
*  That is good to hear, certainly. The president, President Biden, also seemed to reverse one of [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=162.16s)]
*  his own policies this week when he authorized Ukraine to use anti-personnel land mines in the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=168.32s)]
*  ongoing ground war. He is getting fiery, fierce pushback now from human rights groups who are [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=174.72s)]
*  saying these land mines are now going to lie in wait to kill and maim civilians for years to come. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=179.92s)]
*  Take a look at this from Amnesty International. One of their top officials says, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=186.0s)]
*  it is devastating and, frankly, shocking that President Biden made such a consequential and [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=189.84s)]
*  dangerous decision just before his public service legacy is sealed for the history books. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=194.24s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=199.84s)]
*  JAKE SULLIVAN, The Washington Post, The Washington Post. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=200.4s)]
*  Well, these mines are the type that you can turn on, turn off. They're smart mines. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=203.28s)]
*  But, at the same time, it does, it is a step towards somewhat solidifying [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=209.6s)]
*  the lines. And we also needed to stop Russian gains. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=214.72s)]
*  So, there's a number of factors involved there. But, again, one side escalating, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=219.11999999999998s)]
*  the other side escalating, this needs to be within a broader framework to end this conflict. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  It is, Jillian, it is just an absolute meat grinder of people and personnel on that front. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=232.16s)]
*  It is more like World War I trench warfare. President Trump is incredibly concerned about [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=239.52s)]
*  the carnage that is taking place there. And, again, how do we restore deterrence [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=246.0s)]
*  and how do we bring peace? We met with the European NATO secretary-general. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=252.72s)]
*  The Europeans will clearly be a key part of that. All of our allies and partners need to be [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=258.8s)]
*  carrying this burden going forward. And, of course, our energy policy will be a key component [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=265.92s)]
*  with Governor Burghram and his National Energy Council and how the United States is blessed [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=272.8s)]
*  with, as the president said, with oil and gas that we can be using not only to our economic [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=278.24s)]
*  advantage here at home, but as a leader around the free world. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=286.88s)]
*  Surprisingly, we have not heard from the president-elect himself on this escalation [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=291.04s)]
*  in Russia's war on Ukraine this week. I say surprisingly only because he tends to weigh in [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=296.56s)]
*  on pretty much everything these days, either in person or on social media. Do you know what his [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=300.40000000000003s)]
*  reaction is? Well, the president-elect has been very concerned about the escalation and where [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=306.40000000000003s)]
*  it's all going. If North Korea has made this move, we have made a move, Russia has now responded, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=314.48s)]
*  Iran is involved, South Korea is thinking about getting involved, our allies have now extended [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=322.40000000000003s)]
*  the range of their missiles as well. So we need to bring this to a responsible end. We need to [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=329.76s)]
*  restore deterrence, restore peace, and get ahead of this escalation ladder rather than responding [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=337.12s)]
*  to it. So on that note, as you well know, let's turn to Israel real quick. The Biden team has [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=342.8s)]
*  always insisted that a negotiated end to the war in Gaza is the only way forward, but we also know [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=348.40000000000003s)]
*  that the president-elect and his top advisors often feel that these sort of swift military [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=353.68s)]
*  victories are the better way to bring about the ends of wars. How do you see the conflict in [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=361.36s)]
*  Gaza and more broadly in the Middle East coming to a close? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=367.44s)]
*  Well, look at the strength and the grit that the Israelis and Prime Minister Netanyahu has shown. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=372.64s)]
*  Hezbollah, with the pager and walkie-talkie operation and ongoing strikes on their [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=379.04s)]
*  leadership, is completely on their back foot, not only from a military standpoint, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=385.28s)]
*  but from an economic standpoint as well. Hamas has been devastated. Iran is incredibly [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=390.15999999999997s)]
*  exposed at this point. So I think now is a moment to craft some type of arrangement that [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=398.8s)]
*  doesn't just put a pause for future October 7th, truly brings stability to the Middle East, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=408.47999999999996s)]
*  sets the stage for what we saw just a few years ago with the Abraham Accords. I mean, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=415.44s)]
*  Jillian, we had peace deals being signed on the White House lawn just four years ago. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=420.24s)]
*  Look at where we are today. I am confident President Trump and his leadership and the team [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=426.08s)]
*  that he is putting around him will get us back to that point in pretty short order. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=432.32s)]
*  I want to ask you about the NSC, the National Security Council in particular, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=437.92s)]
*  you are about to helm. In any given administration, it tends to have between a couple of hundred, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=441.59999999999997s)]
*  maybe 400 officials on the staff, not very big, but has an outsized role in policymaking in [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=446.4s)]
*  Washington, determining U.S. foreign policy across the globe. What's your, you know, coming in [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=453.59999999999997s)]
*  on January 20th, what is your number one top policy proposal that you're going to be focused on? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=459.28s)]
*  Well, I'll just tell you, I'll just tell you from my approach, President Trump has a mandate [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=465.35999999999996s)]
*  to execute these policies that he has outlined and to continue the great policies he had in his [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=469.76s)]
*  first term. I think in the past, too many people have tried to kind of conform the system [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=477.2s)]
*  or have tried to kind of conform him to the system. I'm going to conform the system to the [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=482.71999999999997s)]
*  best I can, to his style, to his decisions, and to his mandate, number one. Number two, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=489.36s)]
*  for example, we were just talking about the Middle East. Well, a key component of that [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=497.12s)]
*  are Americans being held hostage, and we need to start imposing costs for those that hold hostages [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=501.36s)]
*  rather than reacting and seeing benefit. And number three, the border, the Western Hemisphere, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=508.64s)]
*  working with that team to get it under control. The cartels need to be on notice. Mexico and our [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=513.36s)]
*  partners have to take some ownership here. And then broadly, in the Western Hemisphere, we have [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=519.4399999999999s)]
*  the energy, the food supply, the critical minerals that we need to keep our economy the [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=525.12s)]
*  most powerful it is in the world. And finally, on China, that is going to be much more of a [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=530.72s)]
*  conversation about the strength of our economy, the strength of our markets, how to bring those [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=536.24s)]
*  supply chains back home from critical minerals to energy to pharmaceuticals in that competition. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=540.96s)]
*  And President Trump is going to lead the way on all of those issues. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=547.76s)]
*  Well, sir, we certainly look forward to seeing you at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue come the new year. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=551.28s)]
*  Thank you for taking time with us for your first Sunday Show interview since the nomination. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=555.92s)]
*  We appreciate it. Thanks, Jillian. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct4UnyiJLdE&t=559.3599999999999s)]
