# GOP senator won't accept anything less than this in fight against Hamas
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs)
*  Welcome back, America. We're here with Katie Britt, brand new senator from Alabama, but [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=0.0s)]
*  she's already made a big mark for herself. Senator, you were recently in Israel, actually [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=7.24s)]
*  a week or two ago, and you came back, you were very emotional about what you saw there. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=15.56s)]
*  Can you tell us what you saw and what your experience was? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=21.68s)]
*  Mark, what we saw there was beyond comprehension. It was absolute pure evil. Not only did we meet [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=24.84s)]
*  with the families of the hostages who told us their story, and as I listened to that, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=32.92s)]
*  I listened as a mom, as a wife, as a daughter, as a sister, and the unimaginable things they're [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  going through, we also met with the Israeli government and we got to see the video of the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=43.16s)]
*  massacre that occurred on October 7th. And it is imperative we continue to tell that story, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=49.48s)]
*  because these terrorists actually videoed this. They had GoPro cameras on their head, so [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=57.0s)]
*  we watched as they slaughtered individuals, as they made parents watch their children get shot, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=63.959999999999994s)]
*  and children watch their parents be burned to death. It is absolutely disgusting and despicable. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=70.6s)]
*  Mark, I am of the belief that all religions can live together in peace and prosperity, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  but good cannot coexist with evil. And when you see evil rear its head, which is exactly what we saw [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=83.56s)]
*  happen on October 7th, we must look it in the eyes and we must take it down. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=90.36s)]
*  So you come back to the United States and you see people taking to the streets on college campuses [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=95.16000000000001s)]
*  supporting Hamas. And you see people talking about how Israel is responsible for this. What do you say to those people? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=100.28s)]
*  That is, it's once again unimaginable that people would be responding like this. One of the things [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=111.08s)]
*  about our nation that I believe to be true is that we should be able to call evil evil. And the fact [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=117.88s)]
*  that we have those among us that are not able to do that is beyond comprehension. Look, obviously, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=124.36s)]
*  everybody believes in free speech, but what I do not believe in is hate. And the Hamas is standing, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=132.04s)]
*  what they stand for, they want to wipe Israel off the face of this planet. They want to wipe the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=138.28s)]
*  Jewish people off the face of this planet. And there is absolutely no way that anyone should be [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=142.92000000000002s)]
*  able to defend any of their actions. And what people need to realize is Hamas is also the enemy [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=149.96s)]
*  of those people in Gaza. They are holding everyone. They're for ransom. They're using people as human [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=156.28s)]
*  shields. They are cowards. And we as people here in the United States, me as a Christian, I believe [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=165.16s)]
*  we have to stand firmly with Israel, firmly with the Jewish people and firmly against the hate. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=171.4s)]
*  And the reports out there that Hamas is now shooting at people who are trying to leave, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=177.48s)]
*  Egypt is blocking the passageway because they do not want any Palestinians coming into their border [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=182.2s)]
*  and into their country. There is not a single Arab country that has offered to accept a single [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=187.39999999999998s)]
*  Palestinian. And you see in Turkey, they are harboring Hamas leaders. In Qatar, they are [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=194.6s)]
*  harboring Hamas leaders, Qatar is paying money, lots of money to the Hamas terrorists. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=201.08s)]
*  And the Biden administration doesn't seem to be doing a hell of a lot about this, does it? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=210.44s)]
*  No, you are spot on. First off, we need to go back to a strategy of maximum pressure. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=214.76000000000002s)]
*  We need bone crushing sanctions on Iran. We know where this money is flowing from. It's [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=221.8s)]
*  flowing from the Iranian regime. So what we have to do is cut off and dry up any financial [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=226.04s)]
*  resources that they may have because Iran is not only funding but training Hamas there in Gaza, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=232.04s)]
*  training Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis there in Yemen. We need an administration that [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=238.92s)]
*  is willing to do that. Easing off on these sanctions has resulted in the Iranian regime [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=245.88s)]
*  having over $80 billion in new oil and gas money. We have to make sure that we are actually showing [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=250.44s)]
*  peace through strength, which to me starts with freezing the $6 billion that we have seen talked [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=257.24s)]
*  about over these last few weeks. And I don't mean with a handshake agreement. I mean a real guarantee [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=263.4s)]
*  that that money is not moving. Reinforce sanctions and then we are going to have to start really [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=269.0s)]
*  holding people accountable. We not only need deterrence in the region, but when our air bases [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=275.24s)]
*  are struck, we have to respond with defensive strikes. And to all the people out there that [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=280.2s)]
*  we're seeing across this nation and now the globe that are buying into the media narrative that there [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=285.64s)]
*  needs to be an immediate ceasefire, let me say to you this. The innocent men and women that are there [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=291.56s)]
*  in Israel have to tuck their children in every night. There have been a lot of people who have [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=298.36s)]
*  said that, oh, this is similar to 9-11 or this is similar to Pearl Harbor. What I say to that is, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=303.24s)]
*  when we woke up the next day after both of those events, we were able to tell our children that [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=309.24s)]
*  the enemy was oceans away. These men and women woke up the next day and the enemy was less than [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=314.52s)]
*  five miles away. We have to make sure that we eradicate Hamas. Anything less is unacceptable. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=321.40000000000003s)]
*  And so I think we stand firmly with Israel. We stand shoulder to shoulder with them. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=329.88s)]
*  And we make sure that we eradicate evil, which starts by with taking out Hamas. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQgmgqFoxs&t=334.28000000000003s)]
