# Mike Lawler: Joe Biden is putting electoral politics ahead of safety and security
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [May 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY)
*  All right, for more on this, we are joined by Republican Congressman from New York and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=0.0s)]
*  member of the House Foreign Affairs and Financial Services Committee's Mike Lawler. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=3.44s)]
*  Congressman, thanks for being here. Appreciate your time. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=7.32s)]
*  I just want to — [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=10.4s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Jackie. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=11.4s)]
*  Thank you. I just want to begin where Lucas left off, which is with your colleague, Corey [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=12.4s)]
*  Mills, filing an article of impeachment against the president for withholding these shipments [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=16.2s)]
*  of thousands of bombs. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=21.6s)]
*  You know, as he noted, Reagan did this before. George H.W. Bush did this before. Does what [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=23.44s)]
*  President Biden did, in your mind, rise to the level of a high crime or misdemeanor? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=30.62s)]
*  Look, I think what President Biden is doing at this moment of war is unconscionable. And [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=35.64s)]
*  I think, as Corey Mills pointed out, he is putting electoral politics ahead of the safety [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=42.040000000000006s)]
*  of one of our closest allies in the world. But we're less than six months away from an [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=49.199999999999996s)]
*  election, and I trust the judgment of the American people. I think what the Democrats [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=55.4s)]
*  did in 2019 and 20, politicizing impeachment, did not serve the country well. I don't think [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=60.239999999999995s)]
*  it serves us well this close to an election to be engaged in this. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=68.44s)]
*  I think the objective here is to make sure that Israel gets the weaponry and the ammunition [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=72.72s)]
*  that it needs to prosecute this war against Hamas, a terrorist organization. I think Joe [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=78.39999999999999s)]
*  Biden should be embarrassed and ashamed of himself for allowing electoral politics to [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=84.61999999999999s)]
*  take precedent over the safety and well-being of the Israeli people and the state of Israel. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=92.44s)]
*  So what I'm hearing from you, just to clarify, is that no on impeachment at this point, correct? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=100.63999999999999s)]
*  Correct. Look, we're less than six months away from an election. The American people [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=108.88s)]
*  are going to decide who the next president is. And frankly, Joe Biden's foreign policy [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=114.88s)]
*  has been a disaster, starting with the withdrawal in Afghanistan and now here with the withholding [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=122.75999999999999s)]
*  of weapons to Israel. And I think the American people will render a judgment on that. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=129.16s)]
*  I want to move on to ask you about these anti-Semitism, these campus protests that have devolved into [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=134.64s)]
*  displays of anti-Semitism across the country. And you just had a really wild development [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  at Sacramento State University, where the school has acquiesced to these anti-Israel [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=145.64s)]
*  protesters' demands and met their demand to divest and condemn genocide, ethnic cleansing [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=152.28s)]
*  and human rights violations. They made changes to university policies, including issuing [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=158.44s)]
*  this statement. They say, this is what the president wrote, we believe it's important [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=166.2s)]
*  that our efforts to fund students' education do not rely upon us benefiting from companies [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=169.96s)]
*  that profit from ethnic cleansing, genocide or human rights violations. So in a way, really [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=175.04s)]
*  making a statement about what is happening in Gaza and calling Israel genocidal, is that [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=182.51999999999998s)]
*  how you understand this? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=190.79999999999998s)]
*  It's quite remarkable. These are the same institutions that have no problem taking foreign [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=194.51999999999998s)]
*  investment from countries that actually engage in human rights violations. Israel is not [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=199.95999999999998s)]
*  an apartheid state. Israel is the only multicultural, multi-ethnic, multi-religious democracy in [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=206.96s)]
*  the Middle East. Iran, China, Russia, these countries are engaged in an unholy alliance [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=216.08s)]
*  that seeks to undermine and destabilize the United States and the free world. China is [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=223.8s)]
*  the biggest purchaser of Iranian petroleum. Iranian petroleum sales, up $88 billion since [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=228.52s)]
*  Joe Biden took office, that's what funds Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=234.16000000000003s)]
*  The fact that you have students engage in these protests that are claiming, we are Hamas, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  the fact that Hamas, Iran and China have endorsed these protests speaks volumes to the absurdity [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=245.16000000000003s)]
*  of them. And the fact that these institutions are acquiescing to the demands of petulant [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=251.88000000000002s)]
*  children is an embarrassment. We need to crack down on the anti-Semitism that is running [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=257.6s)]
*  rampant on these universities and college campuses. It's why I fought to pass the Anti-Semitism [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=264.6s)]
*  Awareness Act, which codifies President Trump's executive order into law back in 2019 that [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=271.8s)]
*  requires the Department of Education to adopt the IRO working definition. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=278.08000000000004s)]
*  That is what we have to be doing at this moment. People are entitled to free speech. They're [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=282.72s)]
*  not entitled to engage in violence or threats of violence against individuals simply because [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=287.4s)]
*  they're Jewish. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=293.88s)]
*  Well, and we should note that this decision really has no impact on the war. The sweeping [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=294.88s)]
*  change to the language of the university policy would implicate potentially their involvement [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=300.28s)]
*  with companies that deal with China, which is actually conducting a genocide against [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=305.4s)]
*  the Uighurs. But caving to these 100 or so kids after eight days and making these broad [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=308.76s)]
*  changes is pretty notable, especially in light of the State Department report. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=315.08000000000004s)]
*  And we're almost out of time, but I want to ask you because the State Department has [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=319.8s)]
*  found basically that Israel is lawfully using weapons provided by the U.S. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=323.40000000000003s)]
*  government while very critical of Israel's conduct and calling for Israel to do more. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=329.16s)]
*  The State Department found that Israel's use of U.S. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=334.04s)]
*  weapons is fully compliant and that weapons shipments can continue. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=336.6s)]
*  That's despite President Biden withholding them. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=341.24s)]
*  What's your take on that? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=343.84s)]
*  Again, Jackie, the president's decision and the remarks by Senator Schumer calling for [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=346.03999999999996s)]
*  regime change and Nancy Pelosi calling for Prime Minister Netanyahu to step down are [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=352.03999999999996s)]
*  all political. It's rooted in the fact that they are concerned about electoral politics [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=357.4s)]
*  in Michigan and Minnesota. It has nothing to do with how Israel has actually prosecuted [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=362.68s)]
*  I think Israel has taken great care to adhere to international law. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=368.52s)]
*  Hamas uses innocent Palestinians as human shields. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=372.76s)]
*  They don't care if innocent Palestinians die. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=376.59999999999997s)]
*  They use that as a battle cry. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=380.2s)]
*  Hamas is a terrorist organization that needs to be eliminated. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=383.15999999999997s)]
*  Israel has a right to defend themselves. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=387.56s)]
*  And I remind everyone the fastest way for a ceasefire to occur is for Hamas to surrender [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=390.4s)]
*  and release the hostages. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=395.12s)]
*  That is what President Biden should be demanding. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=396.92s)]
*  That is what Democrats across America should be demanding. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=399.44000000000005s)]
*  And that's what these protesters should be demanding. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=402.36s)]
*  And your colleagues have made that point, that telling Israel to pull back really doesn't [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=404.96000000000004s)]
*  give Hamas much incentive to do that. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=408.8s)]
*  Mike Lawler, thank you so much, Congressman, for being with us. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=411.84000000000003s)]
*  Appreciate your time this Saturday. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=414.32000000000005s)]
*  Hey, everyone. I'm Emily Campagno. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO30eS-HMEY&t=416.28000000000003s)]
