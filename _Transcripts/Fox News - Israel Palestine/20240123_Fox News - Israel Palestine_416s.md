# Multinational strikes from US, UK targeted Houthi capabilities: Pentagon
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [January 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA)
*  All right, we are learning a little bit more about these joint attacks conducted by the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=0.0s)]
*  United States and Great Britain on the Houthi rebel sites in Yemen. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=4.48s)]
*  With us right now Major General Patrick Reiter, of course the Pentagon press secretary. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=8.6s)]
*  Secretary General, very good to have you. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=13.24s)]
*  What can you tell us about how involved these were? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=14.92s)]
*  It seems a little bit more involved than we earlier thought. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=17.56s)]
*  Yeah, thanks very much for having me, Neil. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=20.48s)]
*  So what we had last night were multinational strikes conducted by the United States and [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=23.52s)]
*  the United Kingdom with support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=29.68s)]
*  And these strikes were very specific to target capabilities that the Houthis have been using [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=34.68s)]
*  to conduct attacks against international shipping and mariners in the Red Sea. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  So far our initial assessments are that we had good effects, but we'll continue to assess [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=46.16s)]
*  going forward. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=51.36s)]
*  Again, the goal here is to disrupt and degrade their ability to conduct these kinds of attacks [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=52.36s)]
*  going ahead in the future. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=58.38s)]
*  Now, I understand maybe from your briefing earlier, sir, that the U.S. has at this point [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=59.38s)]
*  destroyed or degraded more than 25 missile facilities since January 11th. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=65.18s)]
*  They've had follow-up attacks, so the fear is they've got other means or areas from which [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=71.10000000000001s)]
*  they can attack us. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=76.02000000000001s)]
*  I know that's sort of like a pinprick strategy. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=78.74000000000001s)]
*  You can't, you know, get to all pin sites. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=82.02000000000001s)]
*  What do you say about their ability to attack, you know, U.S. element shipping interests [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=85.69999999999999s)]
*  in the Red Sea now? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=91.06s)]
*  How much has that been degraded? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=92.61999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so as you highlight, since January 11th, we assess that we have successfully destroyed [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=94.61999999999999s)]
*  or degraded over 20 missiles and 25 missile launch and deployment facilities, as well [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=103.25999999999999s)]
*  as a variety of other capabilities to include coastal radars, unmanned aerial vehicles, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=111.17999999999999s)]
*  aerial surveillance and weapon storage areas. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=117.82s)]
*  So all of that combines to degrade and disrupt their ability to conduct these kinds of attacks [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=120.22s)]
*  going forward. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=128.06s)]
*  Now, we do know that the Houthis maintain capabilities, additional capabilities, and [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=129.06s)]
*  would not be surprised if we see other attacks in the future. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=134.14s)]
*  But what we're doing here is putting a cost on those attacks and essentially making it [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=137.4s)]
*  very clear that there will be consequences. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=143.32s)]
*  So going forward, we'll continue to work with the international community to again [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=146.2s)]
*  put this pressure on the Houthis with the ultimate goal being that the Red Sea and the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=149.92s)]
*  Gulf of Aden are safe and secure for international shipping. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  So, Hriday, today was our first chance to see Lloyd Awcity deliver virtual remarks in [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=158.44s)]
*  his first public appearance since his hospitalization. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=164.12s)]
*  Many have been scrutinized that and wonder what is his health status? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=167.16s)]
*  Is he permanently out of the hospital? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=171.72s)]
*  What can you tell us? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=174.04s)]
*  Yeah, so thanks very much for asking. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  The secretary is recovering well. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=178.0s)]
*  He continues to work from home and perform his duties from there as he recuperates, conducting [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=179.76s)]
*  physical therapy post-hospital. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=184.48s)]
*  And so we, of course, wish him a speedy recovery and a return to the Pentagon as soon as he [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=187.44s)]
*  can. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=191.95999999999998s)]
*  And the highlight today was the 18th Ukraine Defense Contact Group, which brought together [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=193.0s)]
*  more than 50 nations to focus on what we need to do to continue helping Ukraine defend themselves [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=198.0s)]
*  against Russia's illegal and unprovoked aggression. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=204.60000000000002s)]
*  Secretary, his looks, notwithstanding, and some are concerned that he looks still under [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=208.08s)]
*  the weather, it would be an understatement of someone who's been in the hospital as [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=214.12s)]
*  long as he has, but that he is still, according to you, conducting these operations, not only [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=217.28s)]
*  addressing the Ukraine matter you just alluded to, but these follow-up attacks, join or otherwise [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=222.44s)]
*  on Houthi rebels. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=228.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, Secretary Austin, of course, resumed his full duties January 5th and has been conducting [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=229.96s)]
*  and actively engaged in departmental operations, leading the department, and as evidenced by [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=236.44s)]
*  last night, continues to stay very actively engaged in implementing the national security [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=242.48s)]
*  policies of our nation. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=248.28s)]
*  So I'm sorry if I'm slowing the take, sir. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=249.68s)]
*  Is he back at his Defense Department offices, or is he doing this from home? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=251.76s)]
*  Yeah, again, as I mentioned just a minute ago there, he's continuing to perform his [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=256.84s)]
*  duties from home, and we look forward to him returning to the Pentagon as soon as possible. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=261.71999999999997s)]
*  Has there been any discussion of his stepping down? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=266.12s)]
*  No. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=269.52s)]
*  Right now, again, he maintains his focus on carrying out his duties as Secretary of Defense [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=271.15999999999997s)]
*  and ensuring that our nation remains safe. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=276.4s)]
*  The president still has full confidence in him, and on these follow-up strikes, and all [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=279.88s)]
*  still confidence in the secretary leading those strikes, commanding those strikes. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=283.88s)]
*  Yeah, thanks, Neil. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=289.24s)]
*  Well, I'm not going to speak for the president, but I think you've heard him and the White [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=290.68s)]
*  House communicate the president's confidence in Secretary Austin. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=294.12s)]
*  Again, there are lots of things happening in the world right now, as you've seen, and [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=298.4s)]
*  Secretary Austin remains squarely focused on executing his duties as the secretary of [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=302.84s)]
*  defense and protecting our nation. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=306.52s)]
*  Then finally, sir, on the Houthi rebels, and their resilience to a lot of attacks, not [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=308.76000000000005s)]
*  all, they are degraded with each and every attack, but not to the point where they're [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=313.04s)]
*  unable to attack. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=317.72s)]
*  And that's led many of these shipping lines and oil tanker parent companies who've been [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=319.16s)]
*  with me on my business show to say pretty much to a man and company, sir, they don't [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=325.08000000000004s)]
*  want to risk going back in that area for fear of this happening again. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=329.68s)]
*  And if there's a task force accompanying them, they just don't feel safe. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=334.6s)]
*  What do you tell them? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=338.32000000000005s)]
*  Well, you know, certainly that is a decision that each company needs to decide on its own. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=339.88s)]
*  But what you saw here, again, was the Houthis began to conduct these attacks back in mid-November [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=347.70000000000005s)]
*  and despite multiple warnings from many nations, and despite the fact that you had 14 nations [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=353.16s)]
*  plus the United States issue a statement in early January warning of consequences, they've [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=358.98s)]
*  made the decision to continue conducting these attacks. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=364.42s)]
*  And so there is a cost to that. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=367.98s)]
*  And again, our goal here is to ensure that those mariners, that those companies are able [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=370.14s)]
*  to transit this international waterway safely and that the impacts on the global economy [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=374.58s)]
*  are removed. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=380.48s)]
*  And so, again, we'll continue to stay focused on conducting that mission, deterring those [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=381.48s)]
*  attacks should we need to. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=386.02s)]
*  But one would certainly hope that the Houthis stop and stop now. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=388.26s)]
*  General, thank you very much. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=392.21999999999997s)]
*  Thank you, General Patrick Wright, or the Pentagon Press Secretary. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=394.06s)]
*  Secretary, thank you again. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7YL7AbwMLA&t=396.18s)]
