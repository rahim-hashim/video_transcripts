# Biden is furthering Hamas' interests, not Israel: Emily Compagno
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM)
*  Several child hostages have been freed in the temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=0.0s)]
*  More expected to be released today. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=6.88s)]
*  The youngest hostage, taken by Hamas, has just been put in greater danger in a tragic turn of events. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=9.28s)]
*  The terrorists have handed over their youngest hostage, a 10-month-old boy named Kefir Bebis, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=16.64s)]
*  and his family, Ariel and Shiri, not to the Israelis, but to a separate Palestinian terror group. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=21.84s)]
*  I can't imagine getting that kind of news. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=28.72s)]
*  Families' relatives left reeling from the move, calling it just more psychological torture, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=31.919999999999998s)]
*  with fears mounting that Hamas' child hostages are being held as a quote, trophy. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=38.239999999999995s)]
*  Hello everyone, this is Outnumbered. I'm Kaylee McEnany, here with my co-hosts Harris Faulkner [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=44.48s)]
*  and Emily Campagno. Also joining us, former NFL sideline reporter and host of the Michelle [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=49.36s)]
*  Tafoya podcast, Michelle Tafoya, and Fox News contributor and host of the David Webb show on [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=54.48s)]
*  Sirius XM Patriot, David Webb. Kefir's aunt thinks he is being held underground, no sunlight, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=59.68s)]
*  raising concerns that he could be put in the middle of an IDF assault against Hamas [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=67.92s)]
*  if he is not released by the end of the ceasefire, which has been extended until tomorrow. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=73.12s)]
*  Kefir's aunt also revealed some of the traumatic details surrounding Kefir's [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  abduction to the Times of Israel. Listen to this, the terrorists slaughtered nearly half [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=83.52s)]
*  of his hometown. The Times of Israel reports that little Kefir and his four-year-old brother Ariel [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=89.92s)]
*  were huddled with their parents, Shiri and Yarden, desperately hiding in a safe room, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=95.11999999999999s)]
*  armed only with a pistol. Yarden, the father, texted her that the boys were having a hard time [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=100.88s)]
*  staying quiet. How can you keep a nine-month-old quiet, a four-year-old quiet? As the terrorists [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=106.72s)]
*  assaulted their kibbutz and that it felt like the end. Yarden's last message, his last two [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=112.4s)]
*  messages were, I love you, and then therein. Photographers captured images of Shiri surrounded [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=118.72s)]
*  by Hamas terrorists as she clutched her babies in her arms, a mother's love. Now the rest of [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=125.2s)]
*  Kefir's family is speaking out about their struggles to remain hopeful about their loved [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=130.88s)]
*  ones' release. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=134.96s)]
*  You know, Harris, that was Yefat. I'm going to ask our team to put up a picture of Ariel and of Kefir. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=164.96s)]
*  So this was announced Tuesday that there was a hostage deal last Tuesday. We didn't know the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=192.96s)]
*  names of any of the hostages at that point. Well, Yefat, who you just heard from, she posted this [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=197.84s)]
*  about 24 hours after that deal was announced. We must muster the little strength we have to [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=202.16s)]
*  avoid falling apart. We try to resist the urge to anticipate, hope, celebrate, or even imagine, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=206.79999999999998s)]
*  because never before has anyone felt so close and yet so far away from something at the same time. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=212.0s)]
*  Everyone thinks we are excited, but we are not. We are tense, alert, and on edge. We will remain [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=217.28s)]
*  this way until the moment we hold our family in our arms. We are horrified at the thought of [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=222.24s)]
*  being disappointed. We still pray for these two boys, but the news that they are now in the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=227.36s)]
*  hands of other groups. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=231.92000000000002s)]
*  Kaylee, where you started the hour is really where we need to put our focus. It's where Admiral [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=232.88s)]
*  Kirby, who is now the NSC spokesperson for the White House now, it's where Ambassador Danny [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=237.68s)]
*  Danone told me from Tel Aviv today is his focus. It is the fact that this child is not with Hamas. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=244.64000000000001s)]
*  This child is with Islamic terrorists. Maybe gangs of people is how he put it, which is very [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=251.2s)]
*  unsettling. And while Hamas will be held accountable, he said, for any harm that happens to people, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=258.88s)]
*  we don't know as much now. There's not a straight information line to this child and some others [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=264.56s)]
*  they've taken. And we also don't know what their end game is. Gangs of people. That means money's [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=270.24s)]
*  involved, maybe not even ideology. We don't really know. I just know that according to his aunt, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=274.64s)]
*  he was born on January 18th. And as we, you know, look, Hanukkah comes early this year, it starts [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=280.0s)]
*  on the 8th. January 18th cannot come without that baby being home. I mean, we know that there's some [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=287.6s)]
*  hard dates before us now. We know some of what's happened. I know the ambassador last hour didn't [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=294.8s)]
*  want to go into detail very much about what's going on if they're in the dark and they're [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=299.76s)]
*  underground. They're treated very badly. If you're over 12, he couldn't even say that. He [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=304.24s)]
*  was swallowing his words. They were beating them. It's a lot. It's a lot. So it's prayer. It's also [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=309.84s)]
*  the understanding that when a ceasefire breaks, it is a sign that one side wasn't keeping it anyway. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=316.64s)]
*  So how do you fight against terrorists without killing them? I don't think you can. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=323.91999999999996s)]
*  No, I don't think you can. That's very well said. And Emily, you know, if you think about the [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=329.35999999999996s)]
*  emotional journey of this family, imagine if your little cousin was in the hands of terrorists, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=334.15999999999997s)]
*  and you hear there's this deal last Tuesday, and you don't know the names yet, and you're hopeful. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=339.91999999999996s)]
*  And then you hear Friday comes along. The people being released are from their kibbutz near Oz, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=344.32s)]
*  and you're thinking, it's his kibbutz. And then yesterday, more from kibbutz near Oz. And then [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=349.2s)]
*  we're extending the ceasefire by two days. 20 more babies and mothers being released. The hope that [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=354.32s)]
*  you feel, and then the tragedy you feel when you hear about them being transferred out of Hamas [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=359.12s)]
*  hands. And you know, you talk about that hope, and I can only imagine the unwavering faith and hope [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=364.0s)]
*  in God, because there's no way you can have any faith or hope in the monsters that in this moment [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=372.56s)]
*  have this beautiful baby and so many families under their watch, passing it off to gangs and [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=378.88s)]
*  other terrible monsters. And I underscore what Yafat said earlier on Fox and Friends when she [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=385.28s)]
*  said, I can't say that we are surprised about the level of cruelty and inhumane behavior from Hamas [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=391.04s)]
*  during the ceasefire. She knows just like everyone, which is why it is so appalling in my opinion, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=396.8s)]
*  that this administration continues to put conditions on Israel's support. Because we [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=403.28000000000003s)]
*  know that these are monsters, and how can you have faith that they will rise to the occasion and do [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=408.88s)]
*  exactly what we hope or ask or say that they will? Three separate reports this morning coming out of [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=413.28000000000003s)]
*  DC, one saying that the Democrats are efforting to put conditions on any aid to Israel. Secondly, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=418.4s)]
*  that the president told Israel it must work to avoid significant further displacement of [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=424.47999999999996s)]
*  Palestinian civilians. Thirdly, that the CIA chief meeting with the head of Mossad to push for a [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=429.2s)]
*  different approach in hostage negotiations. To underscore the point I've been making, the fear [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=434.79999999999995s)]
*  of escalation from this administration and therefore the conditions that they place on Israel and [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=440.47999999999996s)]
*  Ukraine for the same reasons means that they are furthering Hamas's interests. They are not [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=445.6s)]
*  furthering Israel's strength and they are contributing to Hamas's goal and Islamic Jihad [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=451.84000000000003s)]
*  and Iran's goal, which is to have global condemnation of Israel. So by telling us, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=456.72s)]
*  by telling them continually, telling Israel put on the brakes, slow down, calm down, that is [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=462.08000000000004s)]
*  inspiring even further misplaced condemnation about them responding. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=468.72s)]
*  Michelle, it's like when he said, Israel control your rage. I'm sorry, you have a 10-month, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=474.56s)]
*  now 11-month-old child control your rage? And they have controlled it, right? They have taken [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=480.24s)]
*  so many steps to be, to have precaution, to take precaution, to minimize civilian deaths. I don't [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=486.24s)]
*  think other countries would take as much precaution as Israel had. You've made so many great points, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=491.92s)]
*  everyone. I want to add a personal one. We have a dear friend, an 18-year-old boy, I'm not going to [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=496.8s)]
*  name him. He is over in Jerusalem. He just graduated high school and he decided before [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=502.24s)]
*  entering college he was going to take a year, he's Jewish, to study in Jerusalem. He was there before [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=507.68s)]
*  October 7th. October 7th happened and I texted the family, are you bringing him home? Are you bringing [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=513.84s)]
*  him home? And they said, no, these colors don't run. We don't run. And that is emblematic of the [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=518.72s)]
*  strength that Jews in Israel do have. I love history. I'm a history buff. This is history I [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=525.76s)]
*  never thought I'd see again after the Holocaust, but they are strong in Israel. They are strong in [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=532.16s)]
*  spite of what anyone else wants them to do. Yeah, and the people tearing down posters, the people [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=538.88s)]
*  acting like these children aren't real. David, this is how Holocaust do happen, is denying that [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=543.04s)]
*  these people deserve humanity, exist, and deserve to be with their families. Yeah, and look, all the [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=548.16s)]
*  points, again, to Michelle's point, you've all made great points about this, but pay closer [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=553.44s)]
*  attention, this is what I would say to the American people and to the world. Operationally, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=558.48s)]
*  Israel continues to do what they need to do. The Biden administration can call for two-state [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=563.5200000000001s)]
*  solution. They can try diplomatic pressure. Facts are even the IDF, by their own rules, do not want [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=568.96s)]
*  others fighting their wars. They will defend their country. They will take on the enemy. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=574.8000000000001s)]
*  But operationally, and even during this so-called ceasefire, which it's not a ceasefire unless both [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=579.36s)]
*  sides cease, Israel operationally still gathering intelligence, still doing what they need to do, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=585.92s)]
*  and trying to get as many people back. These hostages are currency. That's all they are for [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=592.0s)]
*  Hamas. They are currency, but there is a short-term and a long-term view that has to exist for all of [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=598.0s)]
*  us, which is in the short term, they have to do what they need to do and eliminate as much of Hamas [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=604.0s)]
*  as possible because in the long term, there will be a better future even with the loss of life. And [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=609.68s)]
*  yes, unfortunately, and possibly the loss of some of these hostages. Yeah, they're currency to Hamas, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=616.0s)]
*  but they're precious children to anyone with an ounce of humanity. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AxqvSA6lZM&t=621.92s)]
