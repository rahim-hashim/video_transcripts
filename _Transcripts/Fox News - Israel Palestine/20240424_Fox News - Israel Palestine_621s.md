# The silence from Barack Obama is deafening: Compagno
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE)
*  We're awaiting remarks from President Biden at a trade union event later this hour. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=0.0s)]
*  He's facing growing pressure to act on the anti-Semitic protests that are sweeping universities [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=6.24s)]
*  across America. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=11.44s)]
*  Earlier last hour, Biden was asked about if he had a message for the protesters. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=13.16s)]
*  Watch how he responded. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=18.52s)]
*  Mr. President, do you have a message for the protesters on campus? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=20.52s)]
*  It doesn't get sold, Mr. President. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=25.92s)]
*  Would you hand it to Bob? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=27.92s)]
*  He walked away. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=29.92s)]
*  I know another former president that might have not been treated in that same manner. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=31.6s)]
*  Hello everyone, this is Outnumbered. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=35.2s)]
*  I'm Kaylee McEnany here with my co-host Harris Faulkner and Emily Campagno. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=36.68s)]
*  Also joining us, Fox News contributor Leslie Marshall and host of Making Money on Fox Business, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=41.04s)]
*  Charles Payne. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  Now many people are begging the question, why hasn't President Biden acted to stop these [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=47.64s)]
*  protests? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=53.84s)]
*  His Department of Education, silent, and Biden himself, he's speaking out of both sides of [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=54.84s)]
*  his mouth. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=60.04s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=61.04s)]
*  Do you condemn the anti-Semitic protests on college campuses? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=62.04s)]
*  I condemn the anti-Semitic protests. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=66.12s)]
*  That's why I've set up a program to deal with that. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=68.12s)]
*  I also condemn those who don't understand what's going on with the Palestinians. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=71.12s)]
*  What a weird shot. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=76.64s)]
*  Even FBI Director Christopher Wray admitted that they're not keeping an eye on the protests. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=77.64s)]
*  Well, of course, demonstrations themselves are not something that we, the FBI, get involved in. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=82.64s)]
*  Are you actively monitoring these protests? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=88.64s)]
*  We don't monitor protests. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=91.2s)]
*  Well now one Jewish professor from NYU is blasting the lack of action to stop anti-Semitism, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=93.64s)]
*  calling out the blatant double standard playing out on college campuses. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=98.56s)]
*  I can tell you if I went into the NYU Square with a white hood on and said, lynch the blacks [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=103.16s)]
*  or burn the gays, my ID would be shut off by that night and I would never work in academia [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=109.16s)]
*  again. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=114.0s)]
*  There would be no need for the words context or nuance. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=115.0s)]
*  I wouldn't be protected by terms like First Amendment or free speech. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=117.44s)]
*  I would be out of the world of academia. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=121.68s)]
*  It seems like we have a double standard when it comes to hate speech as long as it's against [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=123.72s)]
*  Jews. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=128.48s)]
*  You know, I don't understand this. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=129.48s)]
*  I don't understand why you don't just clearly condemn anti-Semitism, leave it there, move [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=132.04000000000002s)]
*  on, why you have to say both things and why in Politico Playbook today they say that the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=136.48000000000002s)]
*  administration, Leslie, is not stressing out about what's rolling out, viewing it as an [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=141.60000000000002s)]
*  obsession of a subset of the electorate. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=146.0s)]
*  An obsession? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=149.32s)]
*  People are chanting that they want October 7th, not once, not 10 times, not 10,000, but [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=150.56s)]
*  many, many times. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=154.68s)]
*  And they're pointing reporters, at least in Playbook, to a poll showing that just 2% of [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=155.68s)]
*  young people, we have it, we'll pull it up. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=160.12s)]
*  Consider this to be an issue that we'll cast their vote upon. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=163.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=166.24s)]
*  They're viewing this through the lens of politics? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=167.24s)]
*  It's an obsession? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=168.88000000000002s)]
*  No, this is anti-Semitism. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=169.88000000000002s)]
*  Point blank. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=170.88000000000002s)]
*  Well, I think, I know Harris, her children are like me, they're half Jewish. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=171.88000000000002s)]
*  I have a Jewish parent, a Christian parent. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=176.4s)]
*  I'm married to a Muslim. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=178.0s)]
*  I feel very strongly about issues in the Middle East and I feel very strongly on both sides. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=179.24s)]
*  When I say both sides, I'm concerned about the forthcoming famine in Gaza. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  I'm certainly concerned about the hostages not being released and I'm certainly concerned [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=188.08s)]
*  about anti-Semitism anywhere in the world. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=192.4s)]
*  Here's the thing that I see, if we're going to look at Columbia as an example. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=196.20000000000002s)]
*  Right now, they have met with the leading organization that is going on with these. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=199.76000000000002s)]
*  They've reached certain deals. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=204.12s)]
*  And then when they talked about National Guard, the talks came to an abrupt halt. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=205.68s)]
*  They extended the 24-hour get your tents out to 48 hours to clear out. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=209.84s)]
*  They said no more non-students that's been part of the problem at a lot of campuses. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=214.6s)]
*  And then in addition to that, no more anti-Semitic slogans. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=219.16s)]
*  What's the administration doing? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=222.28s)]
*  I mean, other than words that they seem to backpedal on. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=223.88s)]
*  Well, first of all, if the National Guard is called in, that would be a call from the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  governor of the state of New York. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=231.32s)]
*  And Columbia has made it clear that that's not where they want to go unless they have to. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=233.07999999999998s)]
*  But the FBI, the DOJ, the Department of Education, you've got all of these agencies at your disposal. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=236.92s)]
*  The DOJ wouldn't get involved until it becomes a criminal matter after the police have handled it. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=242.2s)]
*  The police have handled it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=247.48s)]
*  They arrested over 100 kids at Columbia. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=248.92s)]
*  Columbia has suspended till further notice and some expelled students. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=251.51999999999998s)]
*  And those aren't all Muslim students. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=255.92s)]
*  Those aren't all foreign students. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=257.92s)]
*  There were 200 arrested on the Brooklyn Bridge. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=259.4s)]
*  And they are from Jewish American Voices for Peace. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=262.12s)]
*  You know, Harris, I think a lot of people hearing this, what did the Catholics do to [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=264.48s)]
*  get a memo saying there should be plants in the Catholic churches? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=268.44s)]
*  What did the pro-life community do? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=270.88s)]
*  These are violent threats we are hearing. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=272.68s)]
*  A Jewish woman who had her eye hit with a pole. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=274.52s)]
*  There have been assaults. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=277.8s)]
*  So yes, DOJ should be involved. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=278.8s)]
*  Well, look, I mean, the campus has been all over the road on this. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=280.52s)]
*  I mean, you give a 48-hour reprieve and lengthening of time to take down the tents. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=284.36s)]
*  But what are you doing for the Israel students who now have been, I mean, the Jewish students [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=291.12s)]
*  and some of them are dual citizenship, forced off campus to learn online for their safety. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=296.08000000000004s)]
*  I don't see equal justice here for both sides. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=302.92s)]
*  And so if the goal is to be fair, the university is failing mightily at that. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=307.36s)]
*  As far as the Justice Department, oh, good gosh, you could just poke a nose in that out [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=312.20000000000005s)]
*  of curiosity. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=316.44s)]
*  Are these hate crimes? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=318.12s)]
*  We know crimes are being committed. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=319.12s)]
*  Otherwise, the police say that they never could have gone on campus. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=320.36s)]
*  So you've got trespassing and other crimes, too, that they have been looking at. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=323.04s)]
*  So that's a call already for the DOJ to at least turn an ear to what's going on. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=326.08000000000004s)]
*  I'm curious about what Biden said, though. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=330.64000000000004s)]
*  I even set up a program for those who don't understand what's going on with the Palestinians. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=333.16s)]
*  What groups of people is he talking about? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=339.48s)]
*  You have anti-Israel protesters feuing hate, some of them. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=341.48s)]
*  You have Jewish Americans in fear. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=345.0s)]
*  And then you have this new third group, I guess. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=348.04s)]
*  These people who don't understand what's going on with the Palestinians, because if [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=351.04s)]
*  he thinks those are the anti-Israel protests, we've got real problems. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=353.88s)]
*  He can't even identify hate in this country. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=357.72s)]
*  How in the world is he going to knock down anti-Semitism? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=360.24s)]
*  It's a political year. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=363.0s)]
*  And if you didn't know it, you know it now. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=364.16s)]
*  You know it now. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=366.04s)]
*  Emily, this was kind of lost in Monday's coverage of what happened at this Earth Day event. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=367.04s)]
*  You had AOC who made this statement, essentially condoning the protests with these violent [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=372.16s)]
*  calls, these anti-Semitic words. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=377.0s)]
*  And then what was missed was what Biden said directly after her. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=379.40000000000003s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=383.0s)]
*  It is especially important that we remember the power of young people shaping this country [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=384.0s)]
*  today of all days, as we once again witness the leadership of those peaceful student-led [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=389.40000000000003s)]
*  protests on campus, just like Columbia, Yale, Berkeley, and many others. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=396.64s)]
*  And Representative Ocasio-Cortez in New York, you know, I learned a long time ago, listen [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=401.64s)]
*  to that lady. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=408.44s)]
*  Listen to that lady. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=411.04s)]
*  So how would the media react if a Republican congresswoman got up, condoned anti-Semitic [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=412.71999999999997s)]
*  protests, and then, let's say, former President Trump got up and praised that congresswoman [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=418.24s)]
*  and said, I learned to listen to her? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=422.64s)]
*  Would he be given the same grace and total ignoring of the media? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=424.96s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=428.32s)]
*  Yeah, of course not. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=429.32s)]
*  I find, too, the silence is deafening from former President Barack Obama, who graduated [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=430.32s)]
*  from Columbia in 1983. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=434.92s)]
*  They took time out on Monday to post about Passover. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=436.92s)]
*  No mention of the hideous, appalling display that's occurring on his alma mater's campus. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=439.68s)]
*  And I think we've seen, it clearly is not a Democrat-Republican issue, because there [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=445.6s)]
*  are plenty of people who have a D next to their name, who have stood up for and stood [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=450.0s)]
*  against this anti-Semitic behavior. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=454.52000000000004s)]
*  Chuck Schumer, who you know, if I'm praising him, you know it's a good day. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=457.68s)]
*  He claimed out so clearly, he said, everyone has a right to protest, of course, but when [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=462.32s)]
*  they shift to anti-Semitism, verbal abuse, intimidation or glorification of the terrorist [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=466.2s)]
*  activity on October 7th, of course that crosses the line. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=471.71999999999997s)]
*  Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand, she came out, she called it appalling. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=475.15999999999997s)]
*  She said, that has no place here in New York City. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=477.59999999999997s)]
*  There is a way to say yes, to your point, I feel for humans in this capacity, and yet [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=479.64s)]
*  there is a zero tolerance for anti-Semitism. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=484.28s)]
*  And I note that the Department of Education under Biden's watch, the DOJ, all of his other [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=486.88s)]
*  quick to be quite firm about, for example, lifting up transgender rights and drawing [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=492.2s)]
*  that line starkly, you can never say anything bad about this, you can never do this, and [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=497.36s)]
*  yet there are such crickets when it comes to anti-Semitism, why is it so hard for them [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=502.96s)]
*  to condemn this blatant hate? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=508.32s)]
*  Charles, so you know, there's nothing the administration can do, we're told. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=510.2s)]
*  Well, a former aide of mine, Chad Gilmartin, sent me a brilliant idea. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=513.76s)]
*  I want to pull this up. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=516.88s)]
*  Here's something President Biden could do. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=518.04s)]
*  Will President Biden must answer, will his administration cancel the student loans of [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=520.0s)]
*  any student disciplined for harassing or threatening a Jewish student? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=523.92s)]
*  Fantastic idea. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=529.76s)]
*  Yeah, but the answer is no. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=530.76s)]
*  So we came in with the sound bite of Scott Galloway, Professor Galloway, and I've had [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=532.08s)]
*  many battles with him. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=541.32s)]
*  He's a progressive, he's got progressive economic ideas. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=544.36s)]
*  And what he did is he laid it out there so amazingly. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=548.48s)]
*  Not only this, but this equivocation of, you know, Israel has gone too far. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=551.8800000000001s)]
*  He reminded Americans, hey, you know how far we went in World War II? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=557.12s)]
*  You know how many Japanese died to bring that war to an end? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=561.6400000000001s)]
*  There was no equivocation. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=567.12s)]
*  They lost a lot more people than we did after we were attacked. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=568.4000000000001s)]
*  So this moral high ground of telling Israel when they can stop going after the leadership [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=572.34s)]
*  of who slaughtered those people on October 7th. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=577.68s)]
*  And then what President Biden is doing is just so unbelievable. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=580.8399999999999s)]
*  Stop talking up both sides of your mouth. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=586.7199999999999s)]
*  This is not either or. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=588.4799999999999s)]
*  This is one. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=590.16s)]
*  There's one issue right now. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=591.16s)]
*  Anti-Semitism. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=592.4799999999999s)]
*  Address that bottom line. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=593.4799999999999s)]
*  Yep. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=595.0s)]
*  And you make a great point. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=596.0s)]
*  The civilian combatant ratio is lower in Israel than it was in Mosul, than it was in Japan [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=597.0s)]
*  in World War II, and then it was in Germany. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=601.16s)]
*  So those are facts. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=602.92s)]
*  Go look them up. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=603.92s)]
*  Hey, everyone. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICfL-Vq9bE&t=604.92s)]
