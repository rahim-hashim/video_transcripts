# Three Americans to be released in Israel-Hamas hostage deal
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0Tmv2ghTI)
*  We got a Fox News alert now. The Israeli cabinet approving a limited four day ceasefire with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0Tmv2ghTI&t=0.0s)]
*  Hamas. It will take effect sometime in the next 24 hours. So this is what we know under [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0Tmv2ghTI&t=7.04s)]
*  the deal. 150 Palestinian prisoners will be handed over in exchange for 50 hostages taken [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0Tmv2ghTI&t=11.84s)]
*  by the terrorist group. That includes a three year old American girl whose parents were [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0Tmv2ghTI&t=18.64s)]
*  on October 7th. Jeff Paul joins us live from Tel Aviv. Jeff, good morning. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0Tmv2ghTI&t=23.82s)]
*  Yeah, it took the Israeli government more than six hours debating into the early morning here in [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0Tmv2ghTI&t=30.54s)]
*  Tel Aviv. But this agreement between Israel and Hamas might not only offer a pause in the fighting, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0Tmv2ghTI&t=35.980000000000004s)]
*  but it could give a sliver of hope to all the families of the hostages that were taken back [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0Tmv2ghTI&t=40.94s)]
*  on October 7th. Now under this U.S. Qatari Egyptian broker deal, Israel will receive [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0Tmv2ghTI&t=46.22s)]
*  50 hostages, women and children. In exchange, Israel will then release 150 Palestinian prisoners. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0Tmv2ghTI&t=52.78s)]
*  Now the hostages, as we understand it, will be freed in groups of 10 to 12 people over a span [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0Tmv2ghTI&t=59.42s)]
*  of four to five days. During that time, there will be pauses in the fighting. Prime Minister [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0Tmv2ghTI&t=65.42s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu, who's been under increasing pressure from the families of the hostages, says [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0Tmv2ghTI&t=71.1s)]
*  while it was a tough decision, it was the right decision. But he also added their campaign to [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0Tmv2ghTI&t=75.66s)]
*  crack Hamas continues. We are at war and we will continue this war until we achieve all our goals [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0Tmv2ghTI&t=80.61999999999999s)]
*  to eliminate Hamas, to bring back all of our hostages and missing people, and to ensure that [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0Tmv2ghTI&t=90.53999999999999s)]
*  in Gaza there will be no factor that threatens Israel. Hamas released a statement regarding the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0Tmv2ghTI&t=97.02s)]
*  agreement saying in part, we affirm that our fingers remain on the trigger and our victorious [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0Tmv2ghTI&t=105.42s)]
*  fighters will remain on the lookout to defend our people and defeat the occupation. Now we could see [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0Tmv2ghTI&t=111.42s)]
*  the first batch of hostages released from Gaza is starting as soon as Thursday. In previous releases, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0Tmv2ghTI&t=117.26s)]
*  those hostages have been sent to the Rafa crossing. They then cross into Egypt and from there they are [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0Tmv2ghTI&t=124.38s)]
*  choppered back to Israel. They go to the hospital, they get checked out, and then eventually they're [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0Tmv2ghTI&t=129.26000000000002s)]
*  debriefed by the Israeli security forces here to kind of figure out what they experienced [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0Tmv2ghTI&t=134.86s)]
*  and what they saw. Back to you guys. Hey, Jeff, I was just wondering, you hear the reports they're [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0Tmv2ghTI&t=139.58s)]
*  going to be in groups of 12 to 13. Most people agree that they're going to include a three-year-old [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0Tmv2ghTI&t=144.3s)]
*  girl, American girl, whose parents, a militant, killed last month. Her name is Abigail, and I'm [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0Tmv2ghTI&t=150.38s)]
*  wondering, have you heard the same thing? Yeah, that is, we've heard as many as three Americans [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0Tmv2ghTI&t=155.98s)]
*  could be included in that grouping. We don't know when exactly they're going to be coming out, but [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0Tmv2ghTI&t=163.34s)]
*  one thing I will caution against is that, you know, each day there's going to be 10 to 12 of [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0Tmv2ghTI&t=169.17999999999998s)]
*  these people being released. You hope that there are these pauses in war and that both sides agree, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0Tmv2ghTI&t=173.73999999999998s)]
*  you know, stick to their agreement because you got to think if you're one of the family members and [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0Tmv2ghTI&t=179.57999999999998s)]
*  during the third or fourth day of these releases, you're just praying that nothing goes wrong. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0Tmv2ghTI&t=183.9s)]
*  Women and children first. All right, and thanks. Thanks, Jeff. Leaves 200, though. That's still [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0Tmv2ghTI&t=189.66s)]
*  being announced. Yeah, this is a deal that will only release one-fifth of the hostages. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0Tmv2ghTI&t=194.62s)]
