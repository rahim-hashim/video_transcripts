# Ted Cruz torches Obama, Biden: Not all of our hands are dirty
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA)
*  Senator Ted Cruz joins us now. That is one of the members of the squad, Rashida [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=0.0s)]
*  Tlaib, who has just censured. Senator, welcome back. It's amazing the pushback [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=4.36s)]
*  the president's getting from his own party, his own staff, the State Department [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=8.84s)]
*  that Blinken heads up, as well as there seems to be an Iranian sympathizer [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=12.76s)]
*  at the Pentagon pushing back against the MEK, the dissident group. Senator, your [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=20.2s)]
*  thoughts about this issue. Well, Brian, good morning. Good to be with you. Look, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=26.24s)]
*  this issue is a manifestation and a graphic manifestation of the central [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=31.04s)]
*  phenomenon I talk about in my brand new book, Unwoke, How to Defeat Cultural [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=37.64s)]
*  Marxism in America. This is cultural Marxism that we are seeing, the rabid [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=43.04s)]
*  anti-Semitism, the vicious protests at university campuses where Jewish [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=47.96s)]
*  students are threatened. They're afraid to go to school. Just this week, Jewish [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=53.6s)]
*  students at MIT were prevented from going to class by rabidly anti-Semitic [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=57.440000000000005s)]
*  moms. The Jewish students reported they feared for their lives. And the reason [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=63.160000000000004s)]
*  for this, what my book, Unwoke, explains, is how the radical left sees control of [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=68.12s)]
*  every major institution in America, from universities to K-12 education to [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=74.44s)]
*  journalism to government to big business to big tech to entertainment to science [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  all across the board. And in the view of the cultural Marxist, the world is [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=85.04s)]
*  divided between victims and oppressors. And Karl Marx argued for the violent [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=90.48s)]
*  revolution of the victims, for him the proletariat, it was the working men and [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=95.68s)]
*  women overthrowing the owners of capital. Well, today, the cultural Marxists, they [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=100.08000000000001s)]
*  look at the Middle East and they have defined Jews as the oppressors and they [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=106.08s)]
*  have defined the Palestinians as the victims. And so the cultural Marxists [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=111.8s)]
*  today celebrate the horrific atrocities of Hamas because they are for the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=116.88s)]
*  violent revolution and overthrow. And it is grotesque, it is twisted, and sadly it [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=122.82s)]
*  is the heart of today's Democrat Party as you were just playing in that [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=128.12s)]
*  interview right there. So, Senator, it's kind of odd for you because you used to [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=132.0s)]
*  debate Democrats like Bill Maher. He can't recognize his party. He called, he said [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=135.6s)]
*  for the first time in his life he called out Barack Obama. I was insulted. Barack [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=139.88s)]
*  Obama says our hands are all dirty. Excuse me, don't rope me in with this. My [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=143.56s)]
*  hands are not dirty in this and neither is most of the people listening right [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=148.32s)]
*  now. No, that is exactly right. I was actually on Bill Maher's show just on [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=152.32s)]
*  Friday night, was out in LA, and first time I've done the show. It was a terrific [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=157.07999999999998s)]
*  show. Look, Bill is an old-school liberal so he and I disagree on a lot of issues [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=161.04s)]
*  but he actually believes in free speech. He believes that in reality and [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=166.64s)]
*  so he has the courage to stand up to this woke nonsense. And you know, when [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=174.68s)]
*  Obama said all of our hands are dirty, what utter and complete garbage. No, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=181.04s)]
*  Barack Obama sent $100 billion to Iran. Iran is the lead funder for Hamas. Joe [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=185.48s)]
*  Biden has sent $100 billion to Iran. Joe Biden and Barack Obama, in a very real [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=193.83999999999997s)]
*  and practical sense, funded the death squads that were murdering civilians, that [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=200.67999999999998s)]
*  were raping women and girls, that were slaughtering infants. And so no, all of [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=205.76s)]
*  our hands are not dirty. Some of us were fighting every step of the way saying do [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=210.76s)]
*  not give money to lunatics, to terrorists who say they want to murder [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=214.96s)]
*  us. If you give them money, they will use that money to murder us. That's exactly [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=219.36s)]
*  what happened and yet they're trying to just wash all of that away. Senator, I [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=224.16s)]
*  hear staffs, Republicans and Democrats under 35, White House workers, State [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=228.28s)]
*  Department, they're all on the other side of this issue. Have you found that? The [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=233.60000000000002s)]
*  next generation just, forget about Republicans and Democrats, have you found that [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=239.68s)]
*  they're just not sympathetic to the Israeli cause? Look, it is an enormous [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=243.16s)]
*  problem. Harvard recently did polling of Americans 18 to 24. 51% of young people [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=248.35999999999999s)]
*  said that Hamas was justified and this is the consequence of indoctrination. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=255.32s)]
*  What I explain in the book on woke, chapter one is the universities. I [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=261.71999999999997s)]
*  described the universities as the Wuhan lab of the woke virus. That's where it [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=266.36s)]
*  was created, that's where it's mutated, that's where it spread and our kids in [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=272.36s)]
*  K through 12 education and universities are being indoctrinated. Now I'll tell [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=277.0s)]
*  you also, the last chapter of the book is on China and I explain how China is [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=281.40000000000003s)]
*  intertwined with every one of these and if you look on TikTok right now, which [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=285.72s)]
*  is controlled by China, TikTok is pushing rabidly pro-Hamas propaganda [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=290.42s)]
*  right now to young people. They're pushing it aggressively because they [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=296.04s)]
*  want to undermine America. This is a very deliberate strategy and so this book, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=300.52s)]
*  Brian, is all about laying out specific concrete steps we can take to fight back, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=305.24s)]
*  to take the institution back because we can take it back. And the book's doing [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=312.04s)]
*  great. I was one of your first interviews. Senator Ted Cruz, congratulations on [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=315.96s)]
*  unwoke. Hi everyone, I'm Brian Kilmeade. I want you to do me a favor. I want you to [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcI8qMRZBXA&t=318.92s)]
