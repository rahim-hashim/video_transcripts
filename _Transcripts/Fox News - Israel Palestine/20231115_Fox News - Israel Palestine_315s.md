# White House confirms Hamas uses Gaza hospitals for operations, to hide hostages
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU)
*  The Israeli military right now conducting the critical battle in this war in Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=0.0s)]
*  We showed you this yesterday. I want to share it again with our viewers again today. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=4.4s)]
*  This is the satellite image from the Ashiva Hospital in Gaza City. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=7.84s)]
*  And we have marked internal medicine and dialysis, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=11.88s)]
*  the surgery building, the emergency department, outpatient clinic, the morgue, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=15.36s)]
*  the maternity department, okay? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=19.92s)]
*  So you got that. Now the IDF, the Israeli Defense Force, put out this image [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  and then they said everything in red they believe is what Hamas uses for operations, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  either on the ground or beneath the ground and tunnels below. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=32.4s)]
*  And look what you have here. We did it yesterday. I just want to emphasize this. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=35.4s)]
*  There are five different buildings that they have pointed out. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=39.68s)]
*  Hamas command and control, Hamas underground complexes. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  Going to go back to the previous image, okay? And this is what you have, all right? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  That's the internal medicine and dialysis. It's the surgery building. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=52.839999999999996s)]
*  It's the outpatient clinic, maternity department, people sheltering around that entire area. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=56.08s)]
*  It's a big sprawling area. It's not small. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=60.839999999999996s)]
*  And Lieutenant Colonel Richard Hackford, IDF spokesperson, is with me now. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=64.84s)]
*  So the reason why this is important, especially now, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=69.28s)]
*  is because you've been saying it for weeks now that this is the way that Hamas operates. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=72.24s)]
*  Well, just yesterday on the airplane to California, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=76.84s)]
*  John Kirby said this with the White House. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=79.52s)]
*  Three specific questions, sir. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=99.96s)]
*  Number one, did the IDF military find Hamas terrorists in that hospital or in the tunnels overnight? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=101.80000000000001s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=111.68s)]
*  Right now, this operation is ongoing, Bill, and thank you for having me on. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=115.28s)]
*  We went for something very, very specific. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=121.28s)]
*  We had intelligence and again, this is not us going all out or coming to conquer the hospital. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=123.24000000000001s)]
*  This war is going to be a long war because of the severity and the sensitivity of the hospital. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=129.67999999999998s)]
*  And again, the cynicism of Hamas, I think we all understand here how they are using and manipulating. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=134.72s)]
*  I was in Rantisi Hospital two days ago inside the battle, and you could see that there's a complex. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=140.88s)]
*  There was one tunnel nearby. There was some armory. There was a bike. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=147.0s)]
*  This is going to take time, Bill. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=151.6s)]
*  We're not going to have like we went in, killed the terrorists, and that's it. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=153.2s)]
*  We went in because we understand the sensitivity of going in there. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=157.4s)]
*  After we did everything we can to tell the people to leave, we brought Arab speakers. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=161.28s)]
*  We brought medical teams. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=164.6s)]
*  We brought special unit inside a specific area to the hospital to do what we needed to do. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=165.88s)]
*  And it's a very sensitive intelligence operation, which will unfold during the day. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=171.96s)]
*  The forces are still there as we speak. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=177.0s)]
*  OK, so it's going to take some time. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=179.6s)]
*  Do you know where the majority of the hostages are today? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=181.28s)]
*  The hostages are a very sensitive, painful topic that is being handled at the highest level of government. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=188.36s)]
*  As a man in uniform, that's out of my lane. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=195.56s)]
*  Bill, I'm focused mainly on our two operational targets to talk about. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=199.56s)]
*  One is that we have to dismantle Hamas and two, get our hostages home. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=203.8s)]
*  And I was in Rantisi Hospital again, and we saw again the cynicism of this enemy. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=208.08s)]
*  We saw indications that they had hostages there because we were so careful in saying, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=215.4s)]
*  OK, we have to get the people out. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=220.08s)]
*  The terrorists probably moved out of there and probably moved the hostages to. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=221.92000000000002s)]
*  Last question, sir. And I appreciate your time. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=228.16s)]
*  And we'll see how this develops over time. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=230.56s)]
*  Can the IDF allow these doctors and hospital workers to evacuate patients who are being treated there? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=233.08s)]
*  Because if you could, you would have an all likelihood a better operation to operate there. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=241.07999999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. And that's a great point, Bill. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=248.0s)]
*  I mean, we've been seeing this since this before it even started. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  We were saying move south. Hamas has responsibility. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  I've been looking at the U.E.V. coverage over Gattaset. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=256.76s)]
*  They're moving around in cars. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=259.8s)]
*  We even opened a safe passage up to the action last night from the hospital in the El Wahada road [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=261.4s)]
*  so people can connect to these humanitarian corridors down south. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=270.52s)]
*  They still have the capability. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=274.76s)]
*  If they come out and say we're not part of Hamas and move, we'll make sure they move. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=276.28s)]
*  We're not fighting the patients in the hospital. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=281.47999999999996s)]
*  So then have any, I'm sorry, sir, for interrupting. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=283.56s)]
*  I'm short on time. Have any patients been taken out of that hospital that would help them lead to better safety and care? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=286.28s)]
*  So they've been moving out all the time. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=294.56s)]
*  Last night, I don't know if you've moved out yet from the hospital. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=297.24s)]
*  I'll know more tonight when our forces get out of there. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=300.44s)]
*  OK, sir. They were moving for the last minute. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=302.84000000000003s)]
*  Thank you so much. I'm tight on time, but I certainly appreciate yours. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=306.08s)]
*  We'll speak again later and hopefully tomorrow. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=310.2s)]
*  Richard Heck, thank you from the IDF. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=312.2s)]
*  Thank you, Bill. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFE3Hsf5KqU&t=314.36s)]
