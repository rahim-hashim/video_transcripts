# Hamas understands military pressure and 'we will continue': Israeli Government spox
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo)
*  For the very latest on the renewed fighting happening between Israel and Hamas right now, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=0.0s)]
*  let's bring in Israeli government spokesperson Tal Heinrich. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=4.72s)]
*  Tal, thank you for joining us on your Saturday. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=7.42s)]
*  We appreciate your time. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=9.76s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=10.76s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=11.76s)]
*  I want to get to this ceasefire that has now ended and the fighting continues as our reporter [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=12.76s)]
*  Greg Palcott just told us. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=18.32s)]
*  Where are we on this Saturday now that the ceasefire has collapsed? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=20.52s)]
*  Have you recalled, have your negotiators left Guthur? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=25.62s)]
*  Well, the prime minister has ordered the head of the Mossad and his negotiating team to [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=29.08s)]
*  leave Qatar because there's no point. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=34.839999999999996s)]
*  The talks have reached an impasse. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=37.8s)]
*  Hamas, as you know, released hostages for seven consecutive days as per the outline [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=39.56s)]
*  that was agreed upon. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=44.68s)]
*  And then come day eight, they failed to deliver us the list for more hostages to be released. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=46.32s)]
*  And so they not only that they did that, they also opened fire. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=51.72s)]
*  So the humanitarian pause is over. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=55.54s)]
*  We said, Aisha, very clearly that the moment that Hamas will stop releasing more hostages, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=58.32s)]
*  that is the moment when we stop the pause and we'll resume the fight because Hamas [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=62.48s)]
*  only responds to pressure. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=68.2s)]
*  It's not only us saying it. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=69.56s)]
*  President Biden also correctly stated it just a few days ago. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=71.76s)]
*  Hamas understands pressure, military pressure, and we will continue. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=75.32s)]
*  If it wasn't for military pressure combined with diplomatic pressure, we wouldn't have [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=79.34s)]
*  seen the release of any hostages until today. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=82.8s)]
*  And we are very determined to complete the goals of the swore, which is to bring all [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=85.84s)]
*  hostages home and also to eliminate this terrorist regime that controls Gaza. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=89.84s)]
*  So let me ask you this. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=95.84s)]
*  Would you send your negotiators back to Qatar if things were to change? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=96.88000000000001s)]
*  What would have to change? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=101.56s)]
*  Because I guess what do you tell all the families in Israel right now? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=102.56s)]
*  There's still 130 plus hostages in the hands of Hamas right now. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=105.80000000000001s)]
*  We're going to talk to a family in just a couple of minutes here who still has a family [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=110.44s)]
*  member over there. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=114.44s)]
*  What do you say to those families that are wondering now what? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=116.0s)]
*  Well, these families have been going through a torture of mind and soul as well as our [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=120.28s)]
*  entire nation, honestly. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=127.28s)]
*  And we want to bring their loved ones back home. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=129.72s)]
*  We will continue to invest the utmost efforts. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=132.18s)]
*  I cannot expend on the nature of such efforts because human lives hang in the balance. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=135.76s)]
*  So I will not divulge any information related to this, but I can tell you that we will do [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=141.42s)]
*  everything humanly possible to bring their loved ones back home. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=146.38s)]
*  And as you know, the hostages who returned home, we also want to be able to tell them [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=151.57999999999998s)]
*  that they are completely safe. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=155.44s)]
*  Right now, we still can't do that because Hamas are still in control in Gaza and we [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=157.79999999999998s)]
*  still have this terror threat above our heads. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=163.14s)]
*  I think, yeah, more than 1,200 missiles were fired at Israeli territory over the past eight [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=167.1s)]
*  weeks. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=173.01999999999998s)]
*  It's an impossible reality. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=174.01999999999998s)]
*  Tal, really quickly, I want to get to a couple other things about the military efforts in [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=175.01999999999998s)]
*  southern Gaza. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=181.38s)]
*  But first, on this New York Times report, I'm sure you read, just came out that details [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=182.38s)]
*  that Hamas had been planning this for well over a year in great detail. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=188.01999999999998s)]
*  Does that match with what the Israeli government has discovered about Hamas' plans and preparations [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=192.96s)]
*  for the attack? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=200.84s)]
*  You see, Aisha, there's no doubt here that the October 7th massacre was a very big failure [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=201.84s)]
*  on our end. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=208.60000000000002s)]
*  And we are a democratic country that has conducted inquiries in the past. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=209.60000000000002s)]
*  And we are conducting inquiries right now. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=214.28s)]
*  As we speak, as we go, we are drawing lessons. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=216.66s)]
*  But right now, we are focused on one thing alone. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=219.28s)]
*  And that is eliminating the Hamas regime in Gaza and bringing back the hostages. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=222.95999999999998s)]
*  When the time will come, we will give more answers. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=227.76s)]
*  And of course, our public will hear, and we will tell, we will answer all these important [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=230.64s)]
*  questions. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=236.6s)]
*  But right now, this is our focus. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  OK, so the White House, as you know, does not support Israel going into southern Gaza, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=239.76s)]
*  unless there are detailed plans about protecting civilians. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=247.11999999999998s)]
*  We heard John Kirby a little while ago in Lucas's report. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=252.04s)]
*  And this was VP Harris just moments ago in Dubai talking about this. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=255.64s)]
*  Listen to this, Tal. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=259.68s)]
*  We support Israel's legitimate military objectives to eliminate the threat of Hamas. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=261.64s)]
*  As Israel defends itself, it matters how. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=268.15999999999997s)]
*  The United States is unequivocal. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=273.32s)]
*  International humanitarian law must be respected. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=275.96s)]
*  Too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=279.76s)]
*  So I guess my question is, you know, obviously it's a big concern for the White House because [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=283.92s)]
*  this southern Gaza is where all the civilians were told to go to, to seek shelter. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=288.32s)]
*  Where do they go now? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=294.56s)]
*  And do you agree with the White House? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=295.71999999999997s)]
*  First, Aisha, it's a big concern to us as well. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=297.8s)]
*  We don't want to see any civilians caught in the crossfire between us and between Hamas. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=301.32s)]
*  And all of the casualties on both the Israeli and the Palestinian side that you've seen [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=306.64000000000004s)]
*  over the past eight weeks, all these people would have still been alive today if it wasn't [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=311.68s)]
*  for Hamas' actions. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=316.88s)]
*  Hamas is committing a double war crime here. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=318.88s)]
*  They're targeting our population from inside and underneath the civilian population of [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=321.04s)]
*  Gaza because they know that Israel does not want to kill any innocent Palestinian. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=325.6s)]
*  So we have presented Secretary Blinken, who was just in Israel. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=332.8s)]
*  I think it was his third visit since the beginning of the war that Hamas has dragged this into. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=336.12s)]
*  And we have presented him with the plan that we have for the upcoming stages of this war. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=341.88s)]
*  We are determined to eliminate the Hamas regime. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=348.2s)]
*  There's no daylight between Washington and Jerusalem on that. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=350.12s)]
*  Where would you tell civilians to go now, though, the ones that are in southern Gaza? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=352.91999999999996s)]
*  Have you seen the very detailed humanitarian evacuation zone map that the IDF spokesperson [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=357.4s)]
*  has presented? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=363.09999999999997s)]
*  It's very detailed. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=364.14000000000004s)]
*  It's dividing the Gaza Strip into different locations that are numbered, different zones. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=365.14000000000004s)]
*  So we have designated safe zones. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=373.02000000000004s)]
*  We're continuing to safeguard humanitarian corridors as we'll operate. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=375.18s)]
*  And in fact, we will tell the civilian population of Gaza exactly to which area they need to [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=379.42s)]
*  move in order to be safe. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=384.82000000000005s)]
*  We want to safeguard the population of Gaza. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=387.3s)]
*  I'm sure that some of your viewers are watching us right now, maybe families and friends of [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=389.78s)]
*  U.S. Armed Forces service members, and asking themselves, well, what kind of military operates [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=394.7s)]
*  this way, announces in advance when and where it's going to operate? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=399.82s)]
*  Well, the answer is the most moral military in the world, the IDF. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=404.34s)]
*  And you'll tell them through what source? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=409.78s)]
*  Well, we have different channels in which we've done that before. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=412.41999999999996s)]
*  If it's regular media, social media, leaflets, phone calls, it is very, they should heed [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=418.3s)]
*  our advice, even if Hamas tells them to stay put, by the way. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=424.94s)]
*  Got it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=428.06s)]
*  All right, Tal Heinrich, thank you for joining us. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zl_oJRtYBo&t=429.06s)]
