# 'SHAMEFUL': Emmanuel Macron's call for Gaza ceasefire receives criticism
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o)
*  And we are back with the Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=0.0s)]
*  The Israeli military now says Hamas has lost control of the Gaza Strip as residents evacuate [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  south and tonight IDF says it has hit 5,000 targets since its ground invasion began. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=10.16s)]
*  Also we are learning that tomorrow Israel will evacuate babies from the Al-Shifa hospital. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=17.12s)]
*  That's the hospital where Israel says Hamas has a headquarters underneath it in a vast [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=22.72s)]
*  system of tunnels. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=28.16s)]
*  Jeff Paul is live on the front lines in southern Israel with more on all of this. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=29.66s)]
*  Hi Jeff. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=34.46s)]
*  Yeah, Anita, a late night of fighting here along the Israel-Gaza border as Israeli forces [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=35.46s)]
*  continue to hit northern Gaza. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=42.42s)]
*  In fact, just a little while ago we saw some flares being shot up into the sky and then [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=44.74s)]
*  a short time after that you could hear the booms of possible outgoing artillery as well [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=49.5s)]
*  as possible airstrikes. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=53.86s)]
*  Right now the IDF is focused on tightening their circle in and around Gaza city and they're [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=55.940000000000005s)]
*  targeting the areas around some of that area's main hospital. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=62.04s)]
*  And the reason they are doing that is because the Israeli army believes that they are using [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=66.44s)]
*  the hospital, Hamas is using the hospital as a stronghold for their operations. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=71.1s)]
*  Now the ongoing bombardment is reportedly leading to power outages at the hospital causing [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=75.48s)]
*  patients to go untreated and more civilians to flee. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=80.88s)]
*  Israel estimates 200,000 have left northern Gaza for the south over the past three days [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=85.08s)]
*  alone. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=89.76s)]
*  But tonight Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu making no mention of an all-out [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=90.76s)]
*  ceasefire saying if people want peace, Hamas must be destroyed. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=94.84s)]
*  Now today marks five weeks since more than 200 people were kidnapped from their homes [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=105.32s)]
*  here in Israel and taken to Gaza. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  And many people tonight in Tel Aviv getting together for a rally to remember those people [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=113.84s)]
*  hoping that their showing of support will somehow bring them back home where they belong. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=117.92s)]
*  Anita? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=122.64s)]
*  Alright, Jeff Paul live for us on the ground in Israel. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=123.64s)]
*  Jeff, thank you. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=125.64s)]
*  Okay, so a lot going on there in Jeff's report. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=126.64s)]
*  Something interesting he mentioned right off the top is that tomorrow Israel will, it says [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=131.76s)]
*  it will help evacuate babies from the Al-Shifa hospital. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=137.48000000000002s)]
*  Guy, I know you want to make a point about this, but I want to go to Sarah first. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=140.48s)]
*  Does this piece of news assuage some of the protesters? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=144.4s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=149.6s)]
*  No, I don't think it will. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=150.6s)]
*  Look, the Hamas terrorists did not give the Israeli people living in the kibbutz, living [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=151.96s)]
*  along the border, any time at all to evacuate their children or their family members. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=157.76s)]
*  In fact, they targeted the young people. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=163.12s)]
*  They raped, they pillaged. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=165.8s)]
*  They did the most brutal, horrific acts. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=167.44s)]
*  And I would hope that it would assuage some of those protesters, but I don't think it [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=170.4s)]
*  will. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=175.56s)]
*  These groups, these terrorists in the Israeli IDF as well as Mossad knows it very well. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=177.07999999999998s)]
*  They use children as human shields. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=181.88s)]
*  They do so. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=184.3s)]
*  Al-Qaeda did the same thing. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=185.3s)]
*  Islamic State did the same thing. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=186.84s)]
*  They did that in Afghanistan as well with the Taliban. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=188.8s)]
*  So I would hope that people would come to reason and see what Israel is doing as the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=192.2s)]
*  right thing by targeting Hamas and by saving these children. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=197.0s)]
*  But I don't think so, Anita. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=200.52s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=202.0s)]
*  So lots of news, as I mentioned. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=203.32s)]
*  Thank you for that. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=206.26s)]
*  Coming out about what's happening there. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=207.68s)]
*  One of the things we just recently heard is that the Iranian president has called for [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=209.48s)]
*  the creation of a Palestinian state. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=214.04s)]
*  So I don't know where that goes, but he said quote from the river to the sea when he called [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=218.2s)]
*  for this. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=224.16s)]
*  Guy, what do you make of that? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=225.16s)]
*  That's the destruction of Israel, as we know. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=226.32s)]
*  The Palestinians have been offered a state multiple times, very generous offers, and [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=229.12s)]
*  they have rejected it at every single turn and then immediately attacked Israel after [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=234.24s)]
*  the peace negotiations failed because of their own rejection. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=239.8s)]
*  I see that the president of France is calling for a ceasefire. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=243.48s)]
*  The Israelis should ignore him completely. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=246.35999999999999s)]
*  That is an immoral position from Emmanuel Macron. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=249.01999999999998s)]
*  It's shameful. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  I know we were talking about, I just want to note this. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=252.35999999999999s)]
*  The protests, the pro-Palestinian protests, so-called today and yesterday, there's going [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=254.95999999999998s)]
*  to be a massive pro-Israel rally in D.C. this Tuesday. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=259.36s)]
*  And I think that needs to be as big as possible to send a really strong message because of [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  the propaganda war that's underway that we've been talking about. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=269.4s)]
*  One last quick note about the hospital. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=273.03999999999996s)]
*  Israel is going to help evacuate babies and children from this hospital ahead of this [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=275.68s)]
*  attack that's coming. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=280.98s)]
*  They should get credit for that. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=282.91999999999996s)]
*  This is extraordinary what they're doing to help protect civilians. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=284.32s)]
*  The screamers, the anti-Semites, the fanatics won't care at all. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=288.24s)]
*  But the goal here, obviously by Hamas, is to point at Israel and say, look, they're [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=292.12s)]
*  attacking a hospital. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=296.04s)]
*  And I think that is the point. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=297.04s)]
*  They are attacking a hospital, or that's going to come. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=298.62s)]
*  Why? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=301.4s)]
*  Because Hamas set up their headquarters at the hospital. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=302.4s)]
*  That is about as evil as it gets. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=306.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=308.15999999999997s)]
*  With that in mind, Joey, I want to ask you about this comment from President Macron in [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=309.16s)]
*  France calling for a ceasefire. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=314.88000000000005s)]
*  With all of that in mind, I want to get your thoughts on that. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=316.72s)]
*  What does that mean for the U.S. when the president of France says that? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=320.0s)]
*  Well, France is no stranger in years of late to surrender, you know, or being saved. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  So maybe it's just in their blood at this point. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=329.92s)]
*  Listen, Netanyahu has a war on his hands. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=331.96000000000004s)]
*  He needs U.S. support. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=336.04s)]
*  I don't believe they could conduct this operation without U.S. tangible support. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=337.4s)]
*  There's an argument over what that looks like, but I think that they are reliant upon us [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=342.2s)]
*  for no other reason than to purchase bombs and bullets. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=345.96s)]
*  We need to see resolve among our administration. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=349.29999999999995s)]
*  And when just going back to that last segment, when we talk about the propaganda war that's [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=351.44s)]
*  out there, I don't know that the president of Iran is going to sway many people. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=355.32s)]
*  But the president of France may. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=360.32s)]
*  And so when you talk about the Western, the free Western world coming down in this way, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=362.79999999999995s)]
*  calling a ceasefire a legitimate argument in a time of defending yourself. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=366.68s)]
*  The best thing I can sum this entire debacle of how the messaging is coming out, the best [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=370.88s)]
*  way I can sum it up, something I saw on Twitter. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=375.52000000000004s)]
*  There was a headline that said, Israeli and Israelis getting a get in a firefight at this [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=377.44s)]
*  hospital. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=383.58000000000004s)]
*  And the comment under was, why is the hospital shooting back? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=384.58000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=388.28000000000003s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=389.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=390.28000000000003s)]
*  And, you know, it's interesting. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=391.28000000000003s)]
*  We're going to have to leave it right there because we're running out of time. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5DbEtie3o&t=392.28000000000003s)]
