# Netanyahu’s weapon allegations against the US are ‘plausible’, expert warns
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [June 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0)
*  The IDF launched an attack in Gaza City and the neighboring Al-Shati refugee camp overnight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=0.0s)]
*  Israeli media is reporting that a senior Hamas official was the target of that attack. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=6.24s)]
*  The results of the strike are still unclear at this hour. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  For more on the war in Israel, Nathan Sales, former ambassador-at-large and coordinator [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=15.42s)]
*  for counterterrorism, joining us now. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  Thank you, Nathan, for being here, ambassador. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=21.48s)]
*  We were talking in the break a little bit about this ongoing war of words between the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  U.S. and Israel and just how perplexing that is when you hear Netanyahu very firmly making [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=29.52s)]
*  an allegation that the U.S. is withholding support and stalling arms transfers and then [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=37.12s)]
*  a flat refusal from the White House. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=42.64s)]
*  I want to play for you what John Kirby said reacting to Netanyahu's claim. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=44.76s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=49.72s)]
*  The idea that we had somehow stopped helping Israel with their self-defense needs is actually [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=52.12s)]
*  just not accurate. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  What's going on here? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=65.36s)]
*  Do you think it's possible that Netanyahu is just messaging to a domestic audience and [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=66.36s)]
*  this is actually not happening? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=69.24s)]
*  I don't think we really know what's going on here. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=70.88s)]
*  Clearly something is happening that has caused anxiety in Jerusalem. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=73.64s)]
*  Is it possible that Netanyahu is amplifying the frictions in order to demonstrate to [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=79.04s)]
*  a skeptical Israeli public that he's still the man who can defeat Hamas, he's the man [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=86.64s)]
*  who can secure Israel? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  That's possible. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=92.88000000000001s)]
*  The reason why I think that the allegations we've heard from Jerusalem are at least facially [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=93.88000000000001s)]
*  plausible is because we've actually seen this story play out before. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  We've seen it in Ukraine. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=103.12s)]
*  For the past two and a half years, the White House has given our Ukrainian partners just [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=104.24s)]
*  enough to stay in the fight, but not enough to win. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=109.67999999999999s)]
*  They're afraid of provoking the Russian bear too much, a misplaced fear that Russia is [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=112.39999999999999s)]
*  going to escalate out of control. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  Is something similar going on here? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=119.91999999999999s)]
*  We really don't know. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=121.44s)]
*  I think it's a story that bears watching, but this is very clear. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=122.44s)]
*  Our enemies are watching too. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=125.96s)]
*  Iran, any time the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah perceives daylight between Washington [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=128.8s)]
*  and Jerusalem, that is an invitation for them to try and drive a wedge and try and exploit [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=134.72s)]
*  those differences. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=139.35999999999999s)]
*  A lot of the time, that's because the White House has been publicly wagging its finger [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=140.35999999999999s)]
*  at the Israelis and Netanyahu in particular. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=145.68s)]
*  Maybe the Israelis are turning the tables now and opening up some daylight. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=148.84s)]
*  In any case, when the United States and Israel are in lockstep, that's good for security. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=153.36s)]
*  When we're divided, that's an invitation to our adversaries. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=158.68s)]
*  How much more dangerous is that when you have the threat of another front opening on the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=161.68s)]
*  Lebanon side? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=166.16000000000003s)]
*  I think it's extremely dangerous. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=167.16000000000003s)]
*  For the past eight months, on day one after the October 7th attack by Hamas in the south [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=169.06s)]
*  of Israel, on the eighth, the very next day, Hamas ally Hezbollah started to open up a [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=175.36s)]
*  second front. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=181.88000000000002s)]
*  They've been sending in tens of thousands of rockets that have been fired from Hezbollah [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=183.4s)]
*  positions in the north, in Lebanon, into Israeli communities. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=187.0s)]
*  All told, there's about 60,000 Israelis who have had to evacuate the north. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=191.32s)]
*  They've been living in temporary housing for the past eight months. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=196.16s)]
*  Now think about how the United States would respond if Canada were allowing a terrorist [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=199.72s)]
*  group and we had to evacuate Buffalo for eight months. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=205.24s)]
*  Clearly, the United States would never tolerate that kind of threat. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=208.96s)]
*  Israel shouldn't have to tolerate it either, but it's a powder keg. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=212.60000000000002s)]
*  Hezbollah is one step away from making a massive miscalculation that could set off another [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=216.28s)]
*  massive tinderbox in the north. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=222.56s)]
*  You brought up Ukraine and how the U.S. has handled its relationship with Ukraine aid. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=224.74s)]
*  We had a pretty stunning development this week because it was just about a week ago [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=231.64000000000001s)]
*  that we were with the president in Italy, the G7, and they firmly said, you know, we [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=235.08s)]
*  are not going to change our policy allowing Ukrainian forces to shoot over the border [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=240.68s)]
*  using U.S.-made munitions except for in this very limited space. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=246.72s)]
*  And they seemed like they were pretty set on that decision, that policy decision. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=252.24s)]
*  And then this week they have opened that up to allow Ukrainians to use U.S. munitions [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=256.38s)]
*  anywhere along the border, so long as they're firing at someone that's firing at them. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=261.58s)]
*  We're changing the policy and evolving with the threat, but not to a degree where, you [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=267.12s)]
*  know, if you look at where Russia has its depots and its ground forces, you know, critics [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=273.56s)]
*  of the administration say that it's not to a degree where it's going to turn the tide. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=279.56s)]
*  What do you say to that? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=283.88s)]
*  Well, I'd say, first of all, it's about time. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=285.40000000000003s)]
*  It's about time that the White House took some of these arbitrary and indefensible restrictions [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=288.5s)]
*  off of the Ukrainians. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=293.64s)]
*  You can't win if you're forced to fight with one hand behind your back. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=294.94s)]
*  And that's the position that we put the Ukrainians in since February of 2022, when Putin launched [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=298.85999999999996s)]
*  this war of aggression. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=304.7s)]
*  And we've seen the same pattern play out. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=306.17999999999995s)]
*  We are afraid, the White House is afraid of provoking Russian escalation. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=308.26s)]
*  And, you know, for me, the low point came a couple of weeks after the war started. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=312.5s)]
*  The Brits decided that they were going to impose economic sanctions on one of Putin's [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=316.5s)]
*  mistresses. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=320.9s)]
*  And the United States said, I don't know, this is kind of provocative. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=321.9s)]
*  We're not going to do it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=324.3s)]
*  So, like, what are you actually afraid of? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=325.3s)]
*  If Svetlana can't come to New York and shop on Fifth Avenue, it's going to lead to World [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=327.65999999999997s)]
*  War III. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=332.26s)]
*  And eventually, the White House saw the writing on the wall and imposed sanctions on this [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=333.26s)]
*  mistress. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=338.26s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=339.26s)]
*  The world didn't end. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=340.26s)]
*  That pattern has played out over and over again. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=341.26s)]
*  We hold back arms. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=343.78s)]
*  We impose restrictions on the use of those arms by the Ukrainians. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=345.28s)]
*  Finally, the situation becomes untenable and we take the leash off. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=349.06s)]
*  The Ukrainians take action and Putin wilts. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=353.90000000000003s)]
*  Putin's bluffing. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=357.02s)]
*  We should not be afraid of Putin. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=358.02s)]
*  Putin should be afraid of us. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=360.1s)]
*  Well, we've done it with High Mars, with Atacams, with Patriots. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=361.1s)]
*  I mean, I remember splitting hairs over what's an offensive versus a defensive weapon and [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=363.94s)]
*  you talk about drones and it's like, it seems, you know, like you're getting hung up on the [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=368.3s)]
*  wrong thing. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=373.3s)]
*  At least that's been the conversation for the last couple of years. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=374.3s)]
*  All right, Ambassador Nathan Sales, thank you very much for being here. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=377.7s)]
*  Appreciate your time. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=380.42s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=381.42s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38tcm98cZ0&t=382.42s)]
