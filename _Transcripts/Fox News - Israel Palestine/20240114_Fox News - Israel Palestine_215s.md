# Hamas has waged a war on the west, Israel military expert warns
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [January 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo)
*  Israeli Knesset member and former UN ambassador Danny Danan joins us now to look at the last [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=0.0s)]
*  100 days. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=5.72s)]
*  Danny, thanks for being here. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=6.72s)]
*  Update the American audience on the status of the fight. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=8.8s)]
*  Where is Israel right now in responding to that dastardly attack that happened 100 days [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=11.64s)]
*  ago? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  Good morning, Pete. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  We haven't forgotten what happened 100 days ago when we were caught by surprise. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  1,200 people were massacred, hundreds were kidnapped, and today we are fighting back [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=26.08s)]
*  to bring back the hostages. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=31.839999999999996s)]
*  We have 136 hostages. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  As we speak, it's an ongoing atrocity. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=37.16s)]
*  Young girls at the ages of 18 and 19 are being sexually abused for 100 days. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=40.28s)]
*  So our soldiers are in Gaza now, focusing mainly on 1,000 part of Gaza, looking for [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=47.68s)]
*  the leadership of Hamas. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=53.2s)]
*  And we are determined, Pete, we are determined to do whatever is necessary to bring them [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=55.16s)]
*  back home safely. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  It's not easy. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  You know, we are fighting a very vicious organization. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  They built an underground city under Gaza. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=65.52s)]
*  So we work very slowly, but we are determined to finish the mission. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=68.75999999999999s)]
*  Danny, what do you make of these protests that we're seeing across the globe and in [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  the United States, the pressure they're trying to put on the White House here to slow you [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=77.52s)]
*  down? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=83.12s)]
*  Are you getting the level of support you need to wage this war on Hamas? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=84.12s)]
*  So we have seen protests in different capitals all over the world, and those people, they [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=91.12s)]
*  never mentioned who started this war. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  They are actually supporting a terrorist organization like al-Qaeda, like ISIS. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=99.32000000000001s)]
*  I don't understand how you can actually support Hamas. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=104.52000000000001s)]
*  They don't mention the hostages. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=107.64s)]
*  They don't mention the victims. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=109.4s)]
*  You know what? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=111.48s)]
*  We don't care about it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=112.48s)]
*  We care about our safety, about our security, and that's why we are so convicted and united [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=113.84s)]
*  in our fight for our security, for our future. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=119.64s)]
*  And we are grateful for the support we receive from the U.S., from Germany, from other modern [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=124.08s)]
*  democracies, that they all understand that it's a fight against modernity, against us, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  but they are actually fighting against the West. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=135.18s)]
*  Danny, some people, I think, watching here might be surprised of the, not how slow the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=138.68s)]
*  pace is, but what it takes to dislodge Hamas. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=145.08s)]
*  How much time do you think it will take in your mind? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=149.64000000000001s)]
*  So I have to be very sincere with you. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  It is very slowly, because we operate in a very difficult situation where you have civilians [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=156.56s)]
*  and Hamas is hiding beneath the civilians, and we do the best to minimize civilian casualties. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=162.56s)]
*  You know, we provide hundreds of trucks of humanitarian aid into Gaza every day. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=169.0s)]
*  So for us, it is a challenge to operate in such a sophisticated ground. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=173.32s)]
*  But I think we are moving forward. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=179.16s)]
*  We were able to take care of the majority of the Hamas forces, but they are hiding. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=181.88s)]
*  So it will take more time until we will get in the tunnels, we'll find the leadership, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=187.48s)]
*  and we will, God will, release the hostages. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=192.88s)]
*  God willing, I hope you find every single one of those Hamas fighters and kill them [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=196.52s)]
*  and get every single one of those hostages back. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=199.8s)]
*  God bless you, Danny. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=202.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=203.0s)]
*  Good luck. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=204.0s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFYjsGjdnQo&t=205.0s)]
