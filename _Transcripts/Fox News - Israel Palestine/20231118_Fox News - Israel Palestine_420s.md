# A ceasefire would be a ‘bandaid solution’: Netanyahu senior adviser
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM)
*  Let's go to Mark Regev, the senior advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=0.0s)]
*  Mark, it's always good to have you, and thanks for taking the time. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=4.32s)]
*  You no doubt have been hearing this pressure globally for Israel to commit to a ceasefire, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  and now the president's hearing it from members within his own party and even outside his [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=13.68s)]
*  party. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=19.68s)]
*  Does that kind of talk, Mark, worry you? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=20.68s)]
*  So, Neil, it's important to distinguish between humanitarian pauses, which we have done and [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=22.96s)]
*  we are doing and will continue to do to ensure that humanitarian aid reaches people, to make [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=28.599999999999998s)]
*  sure that people can escape dangerous areas, that sort of thing we have been doing and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=33.879999999999995s)]
*  we are doing. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=38.68s)]
*  That's a specific timeout in a specific area for a specific time. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=39.68s)]
*  But a general ceasefire to let up on Hamas, we've said we will only do that for the release [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=44.739999999999995s)]
*  of our hostages. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=49.56s)]
*  Otherwise we're going to, and that will be temporary. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=51.2s)]
*  We are going to continue the campaign against Hamas. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=53.76s)]
*  And let me explain why. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=56.64s)]
*  Most people who believe in a ceasefire, maybe they don't understand, but it means Hamas [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=59.4s)]
*  remains in power. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=63.279999999999994s)]
*  It means Gaza remains a terror enclave ruled by a brutal terrorist organisation. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=64.88s)]
*  That means we're just going to have more violence down the road. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=71.72s)]
*  And so I can understand emotionally some people think, oh, let's just stop the bloodshed, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=74.72s)]
*  but it's a bandaid solution. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=78.84s)]
*  It's not a real solution. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=80.28s)]
*  It's a quick fix that just means a month from now, four months from now, a year from now, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=81.28s)]
*  you're just going to have more massacres like we had on October 7th. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=86.2s)]
*  And if you will allow me, I quote the Hamas leadership. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=89.92s)]
*  They say the Hamas leadership says we will do it again and again and again. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=93.0s)]
*  We can't let them do so. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  Now they've been very clear about that. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=100.56s)]
*  Let me ask you though, Mark, much has been made of what you and your soldiers have discovered [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=102.48s)]
*  beneath this Al-Shifa hospital that looks like a Hamas military compound. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=109.12s)]
*  They're down to showing not only the tunnels under that hospital, but a cache of weapons [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=113.52s)]
*  and the like, and yet showing people pretty much all over the world what was there. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=117.88s)]
*  You're still having a devil of a time, as one news organisation put it, proving it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=123.36s)]
*  Well, you did show it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=127.52s)]
*  So does that frustrate you? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=128.92s)]
*  In my line of work, it's not good to get frustrated, but we'll be showing more and more as the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=132.8s)]
*  days go on. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=139.56s)]
*  As we secure the area and it's possible to bring in cameras and to bring in journalists [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=140.72s)]
*  so they can see with their own eyes. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=145.68s)]
*  And I have no doubt that we'll be showing more and more. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=147.52s)]
*  But what confuses people, and maybe this needs to be explained, is you get all these people [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=149.48s)]
*  in the hospital, Palestinians, Gazans, who say, oh, we've never seen Hamas and we've [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=154.12s)]
*  got no information whatsoever about there being underground fortifications. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  Yes. But people have to understand Gaza is not a democracy. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=162.68s)]
*  Gaza is ruled by this very brutal, authoritarian terrorist group, Hamas, and people who would [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=166.72s)]
*  speak out and say the truth and say we actually know that Hamas has a military compound underneath [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=172.84s)]
*  the hospital, they would pay a price. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=178.04000000000002s)]
*  They would face retribution, Barnett retribution. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=180.24s)]
*  And so every time you hear someone around the hospital area, someone in Gaza saying, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=183.64000000000001s)]
*  no, we've never seen Hamas here, you have to know that they can't say anything else. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  If they did say anything else, they'd be in serious trouble with their local authorities. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=192.32s)]
*  Let me ask you a little bit about maybe a dust up within the prime minister's own party, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=197.92s)]
*  Yair Lapid, an opposition leader, saying that Benjamin Netanyahu has to go for a variety [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  of reasons, just doesn't like the guy, thinks he's handled the war wrong and what led up to it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=209.56s)]
*  But he said it would still be a member of the Likud party, the prime minister's party, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=213.79999999999998s)]
*  but not him. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=219.84s)]
*  What do you think of that? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=221.92s)]
*  So we have a parliamentary democracy like in Britain, like in Germany. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=224.0s)]
*  We don't have a presidential system like you have in the US. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=228.0s)]
*  And the job of the leader of the opposition is to bring down the government. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=230.79999999999998s)]
*  That's his constitutional responsibility in our system. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  But I think what is important to remember, what is important to remember is that since [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  this terrible October 7 massacre of our people, you've seen a sense of common purpose and [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=241.83999999999997s)]
*  unity in Israel like never before. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=247.16s)]
*  And the truth is not Mr. Lapid himself, but other major parties from the opposition have [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=249.72s)]
*  actually joined the government in this emergency wartime coalition because there's a sense [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=254.56s)]
*  that look, the first thing we've got to do is we've got to defeat Hamas. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=259.44s)]
*  We've got to get the hostages back. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=263.28000000000003s)]
*  We've got to make sure that when this is over, that there's no longer a terror group running [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=265.2s)]
*  Gaza and that can inflict the sort of bloodshed on our people like they did on October 7. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=269.8s)]
*  So I think the feeling in the country now is we need victory. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=275.68s)]
*  We need to win this. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=278.72s)]
*  This is going to require a national effort. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=280.0s)]
*  We need unity for that. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=282.84000000000003s)]
*  Once that's all done, we can go back to politics than usual. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=284.32000000000005s)]
*  But I think at the moment we have to concentrate on winning this war. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=286.96000000000004s)]
*  He will be with me later on this show. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=291.52000000000004s)]
*  But one of the things I noticed is that an impatience with the way Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=294.6s)]
*  and this coalition government is handling the war. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=299.68s)]
*  We're only six weeks into that and this whole thing. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=303.48s)]
*  But does that part of it bother you? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=306.40000000000003s)]
*  Six weeks in and already someone saying this thing isn't working. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=308.56s)]
*  So I disagree. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=313.48s)]
*  First of all, if this is going to be done properly and we are going to destroy Hamas [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=315.16s)]
*  and have a new reality in Gaza where it will no longer be ruled by this terrorist organization, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=319.24s)]
*  that could require time. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=324.8s)]
*  And I understand everyone wants this to be over quickly. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=326.44s)]
*  Israelis would like it to be over quickly. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=328.68s)]
*  That's the automatic response that most people feel. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=330.32s)]
*  But no, it's more important that this is done properly. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=332.96s)]
*  A very close friend of mine was recently at the home of an Israeli soldier who was killed [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=336.92s)]
*  in the fighting in Gaza. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=342.64000000000004s)]
*  And we have, you know, you make like a call upon the Burib family, it's tradition. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=344.36s)]
*  And he said to me, the message was, get this done. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=350.76000000000005s)]
*  We've lost some 50 soldiers in the ground operation in Gaza so far, we're going to lose more. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=355.24s)]
*  But people understand this has to be done. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=359.44s)]
*  We refuse, Neal, Israelis refuse to live next to a terror enclave any longer. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=362.40000000000003s)]
*  We saw what that brings. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=368.48s)]
*  It brought out the terrible massacre of October 7th. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=370.40000000000003s)]
*  And as you said before, they will do it again and again and again, unless we eliminate them. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=372.6s)]
*  And we have to eliminate Hamas. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=378.04s)]
*  But ultimately, it must be remembered. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=379.44s)]
*  That's not just good for Israel. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=381.56s)]
*  It doesn't just bring safety and security to the Israeli people. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=382.84000000000003s)]
*  But that's ultimately also good for the people of Gaza who deserve better than this authoritarian [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=386.2s)]
*  terrorist regime that is both and nothing but hardship, misery, bloodshed and poverty. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=391.28s)]
*  Mark Reagan, thank you very much. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=400.15999999999997s)]
*  Very strongly stated. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=401.84s)]
*  The senior advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=402.79999999999995s)]
*  Be safe, be well, Mark. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=405.91999999999996s)]
*  Thank you again. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=407.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92n9Ts6dapM&t=408.52s)]
