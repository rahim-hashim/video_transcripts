# Jason Chaffetz: There is no justification for this
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY)
*  All right, tonight, sadly, anti-Semitism, it is on the rise. Democrats, they seem not quite as sure [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=0.0s)]
*  how to respond. On Thursday, the very first day of Hanukkah, a man shouting, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=6.32s)]
*  Free Palestine, literally fired a shotgun outside of a temple. Now, this, as many on the left are [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=11.68s)]
*  voicing public support for a global Islamic war, or what they call Antifahter, and other [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=18.48s)]
*  left-wing demonstrators now openly condoning what? The rape, the murder, the torture of [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=25.2s)]
*  October the 7th, praising Hamas for confronting their, quote, oppressors by any means necessary. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=30.56s)]
*  Earlier in the week, we had the presidents of Harvard and MIT and UPenn. They refused to condemn [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=37.28s)]
*  calls for genocide without more context. And get this, the executive director of the group CARE, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  that's the Council on American Islamic Relations, recently praising the October 7th massacre, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=50.0s)]
*  proclaiming that Israel has no right to self-defense. Really? Take a look. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=57.2s)]
*  The people of Gaza only decided to break the siege, the walls of the concentration camp, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=63.04s)]
*  on October 7th. And yes, I was happy to see people breaking the siege and throwing down the shackles [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=72.56s)]
*  of their own land and walk free into their lands that they were not allowed to walk in. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=82.48s)]
*  And yes, the people of Gaza have the right to self-defense. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=92.56s)]
*  All right. And get this, it gets way worse. The Biden administration, they were coordinating with [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  CARE in an official capacity to, quote, combat anti-Semitism. Now, since those despicable and [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=102.8s)]
*  repulsive comments, the White House has been frantically trying to distance itself from CARE [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=110.24s)]
*  and scrubbing any mention of the group from the White House website. And both the vice president [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=116.24s)]
*  and the second gentleman have also recently condemned anti-Semitism, frankly, after weeks of [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=121.92s)]
*  silence. Here with reaction, Fox News contributor Jason Chaffetz and bestselling author and former [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=128.56s)]
*  special envoy for combating anti-terrorism, Noah Tishby is with us. Noah, your reaction to this. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=134.24s)]
*  My reaction is that we're very pleased that CARE was removed from the White House website [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=142.88s)]
*  when anything that has to do with anti-Semitism. The fact of the matter is this. CARE has had a [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=147.04s)]
*  history of, let's say, questionable remarks when it comes to the Jewish people, and they should not [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=152.72s)]
*  have been a part of the anti-Semitism strategy of the White House. One of their San Francisco chairs [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=157.44s)]
*  said a couple of years ago that we have to be careful of the Zionist's organizations. What we're [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=162.88s)]
*  seeing here is the truth coming out. The fact of the matter is this. All these organizations [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=168.88s)]
*  do not want Israel to exist. They're trying to wipe Israel off the map, and they're trying to do [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=174.4s)]
*  this in a very convoluted and kind of like hidden way. We've been saying for a very long time that [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=178.96s)]
*  anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism are one and the same, and this is exactly what we're seeing right [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=184.08s)]
*  now. The truth is coming out. They don't want Israel to exist, and we need to fight this. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=188.4s)]
*  I want to say one more thing about that. Nihad Awad, OK, he was talking about Gazan people [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=192.72s)]
*  owning, walking on their land. They're denying Jewish nativity and ingenuity in the land of [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=197.76s)]
*  Israel, which is absolutely ridiculous. We're about to celebrate the birthday of a Jewish man [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=204.64s)]
*  who lived in Nazareth over 2,000 years ago, and they're trying to tell us that Jews have not been [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  in Israel since before 1948. This is absolutely ridiculous. I'm very happy that that organization [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=214.56s)]
*  was removed from anything that has to do with the White House strategy on anti-Semitism. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=220.64s)]
*  What do you make, Jason, of the Biden administration embracing the group care? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=225.2s)]
*  We know their history. Why? Why would they do that? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=229.6s)]
*  There's no justification, and they're not the only ones. The interns and the other people and [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=235.51999999999998s)]
*  the staff in the White House have also been problematic. You know, Adolf Hitler killed [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=239.83999999999997s)]
*  millions of Jews, and he slaughtered millions of ethnic minorities, and he did it with the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=244.48s)]
*  justification that he needed this genocide to help cleanse the earth. And yet Hamas takes this [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=250.48s)]
*  same position, and these university professors, the care and others, say that, well, you just have [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=256.32s)]
*  to put it in context. And so they went out and slaughtered another 1,300 people, and then they [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=262.96s)]
*  say that proudly, and they think that the people of Harvard and the students of Harvard, that that's [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=269.2s)]
*  not a hate crime or that's not threatening or intimidating to go out and say, you know, we really [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=274.4s)]
*  should carry on, because what they are advocating for is exactly what was advocated for by Adolf [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=279.6s)]
*  Hitler. They claim the same types of things, and they should be just absolutely, they got to deport [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=285.44s)]
*  the people that are here that are guests of the United States, and they got to get serious about [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=292.8s)]
*  cleaning this up. But the White House, it's an embarrassment. Can't allow it to happen for sure. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=297.6s)]
*  No, thank you. Great to see you. And Jason, always good to have you. Thank you. Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMHiqODswY&t=301.84000000000003s)]
