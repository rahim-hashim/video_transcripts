# Democrat 'Squad' member tears into 'maniac' Netanyahu
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE)
*  And of course, in the face of protest after protest after protest, we've seen President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=0.0s)]
*  Biden's messaging slowly but surely shifting. So he bends to the wind since October 7th. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=4.64s)]
*  My administration's support for Israel's security is rock solid and unwavering. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  I come to Israel with a single message. As long as the United States stands and we will stand [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  forever, we'll not let you ever be alone. There's no notion that Palestinians are telling the truth [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=22.88s)]
*  about how many people are killed. I'm sure innocents have been killed and it's the price [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=28.8s)]
*  of waging a war. I'm of the view, as you know, that the conduct of the response [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=33.28s)]
*  in Gaza in the Gaza Strip has been over the top. The major military operation in [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=45.92s)]
*  Ra'ar Afa should not proceed without a credible plan, a credible plan for ensuring the safety [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=54.08s)]
*  and support of more than one million people sheltering there. They need to be protected. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=60.0s)]
*  Duplicitous. The chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus with this. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=74.4s)]
*  This particular issue on Gaza is is breaking our coalition. We need that fragile coalition [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=79.04s)]
*  to come back together, but this is a moral issue for people. And so there's not a lot of time to [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=88.0s)]
*  fix it. The worse it gets in Gaza, the harder it gets to bring people back in. And far left member [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=93.92s)]
*  Jamal Bowman is now backing Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's call for a new election [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=102.72s)]
*  in Israel. They want a regime change. Bowman is not shy about his feelings on the current Israeli [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=110.72s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. There's a humanitarian crisis. The majority of Gaza has [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=117.68s)]
*  already been destroyed through acts of collective punishment by this maniac, Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=125.2s)]
*  I'm 100 percent with Senator Schumer. He needs to be removed. He is a blockade to a pathway to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=131.92s)]
*  peace. Have we heard him actually call the Hamas savages maniacs? Maybe we can find some [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=139.76s)]
*  tape of that. I'll look for it. A pro-Israel Democrat Jewish group is endorsing primary [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=145.83999999999997s)]
*  challengers to Jamal Bowman now and fellow squad member Cory Bush. Those are those on the far left [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=152.23999999999998s)]
*  who say things like what you just heard. And all of this is over their anti-Israel rhetoric. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=158.72s)]
*  Sean Duffy, former Wisconsin congressman and co-host of the Bottom Line on Fox Business. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=165.36s)]
*  And Mark Penn is with us, former Clinton advisor, Democratic pollster, and Stagwell CEO. Gentlemen, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=170.16s)]
*  great to see you both. You know, Jamal's words are cutting. And again, I'll look for when he [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=175.52s)]
*  condemned Hamas in the same type of language, madmen and monsters and that sort of thing. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=183.12s)]
*  Mark Penn, will I find it? You know, you probably won't find it. Maybe you will. But you know, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=189.44s)]
*  a lot of this language here has been very, very helpful to Hamas. You know, there are American [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=198.16s)]
*  hostages there, and yet none of these folks are saying American and Israeli hostages should be [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  released now unconditionally. Well, we have the parents of one of those American hostages. He was [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=212.24s)]
*  getting ready to go to school at Binghamton University on Long Island, New York. He's now [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=219.44s)]
*  that hostage for all these months, six months. Sean, your take. So, heroes, listen, we're in [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=224.24s)]
*  campaign season, right? So things get pretty funky. And I'll just tell you that I believe that [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=232.32000000000002s)]
*  what Joe Biden is doing here, trying to placate this radical liberal left, these young students [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=236.88s)]
*  who are completely animated by the Hamas Israel issue. And by the way, if you're just a Fox viewer, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=242.56s)]
*  you don't see that. But if you have young kids or you're on TikTok, these young people, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=247.84s)]
*  they're motivated, they're energized. And Joe Biden has to do something to placate them. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=251.51999999999998s)]
*  Now, they're also going to vote on the economy and inflation. But I don't know that the independent [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=256.4s)]
*  voter or the soft Democrat is going to vote on the Israel issue or the Hamas issue. They're [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=264.0s)]
*  going to vote on the economy. So I think Joe Biden is trying to cut the baby here and have it both [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=269.84s)]
*  ways, win these radical lefties back, all the while trying to improve the economy and keep those [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=274.08s)]
*  moderates with them, trying to put the coalition back together. Listen, it doesn't make sense to [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=279.6s)]
*  me, Harris, but in political season, Joe Biden's trying to win these radical lefties back into his [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=284.08s)]
*  party, into his graces. Well, and I guess those radicals, as you call them, I mean, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=289.52s)]
*  there are a lot of other names, I guess we could call people who call for the extinction of another [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=295.28s)]
*  faith of people. But I guess those people on the far left who feel that way, those voters, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=301.68s)]
*  those protesters must then look at this hostage situation as what? I mean, I don't know if this is [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=307.68s)]
*  sustainable. Look at this Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna, apparently not worried about voters [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=314.24s)]
*  abandoning President Biden over his handling of the Israel Hamas war. Watch. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=319.84000000000003s)]
*  I think people realize that there is a crisis. They see images of people dying and they want [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=325.68s)]
*  the war to end. They want Israel to be secure, but they also want Palestinian lives not to be lost. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=331.52s)]
*  And I think once the war comes to an end under the president's leadership, his numbers will [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=337.12s)]
*  improve just like his numbers have bounced back on the economy. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=341.52s)]
*  Mark, this is just such a weird place to be in. Women were raped and tortured. Those women were [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=345.91999999999996s)]
*  not immediately believed, not even by the United Nations. It took them months to even qualify that [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=350.96s)]
*  any of that could be true, even though there were GoPro pictures and all the rest taken by [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=356.79999999999995s)]
*  the Hamas terrorists. Why is it so hard to believe that there is killing in war and the killing [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=361.59999999999997s)]
*  started by Hamas? Or does that matter to the people on the far left? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=368.0s)]
*  Well, you know, look at your own poll showed when you frame it as Israelis or Palestinians, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=373.44s)]
*  more than two to one support for Israel. When you frame it as Israel or Hamas, it's more than four [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=379.84s)]
*  to one support. Look, Hamas here carried out something akin to Pearl Harbor. Twelve hundred [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=386.0s)]
*  people in a nation of nine million. We were a much bigger nation. There were 68 civilians [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=392.8s)]
*  killed in Pearl Harbor in 2000 military, 9-11. This is a heinous act. And the support here is [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=397.76s)]
*  much stronger than is indicated by these protests overall. And Joe Biden has to worry about the [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=405.28000000000003s)]
*  swing voters. The left is going to vote for him. They're not going to vote Donald Trump. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=410.8s)]
*  Sean, your last word on this. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=416.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=417.84s)]
*  Yes. First of all, the swing voters are going to care about the economy and the border. That's [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=419.03999999999996s)]
*  what their big issues are. But, yeah, you know, going back to the Israeli issue and what the media [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=423.52s)]
*  does, when you have the media only promote the fact that Israel has responded to the attacks, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=429.68s)]
*  as opposed to showing the GoPro video that you just mentioned, Harris, the perception of the [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=435.2s)]
*  American people is one thing because that's what the media presents. If they spend as much time [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=439.92s)]
*  presenting the horror of the attack on Israel, I think the perception of the American people [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=444.08s)]
*  may be different. But you have the politics being played by the media, not purveyors of truth and [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=448.8s)]
*  just information for the American people to disseminate and process. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=454.88s)]
*  All right. And then in the middle of all this conversation, should there be a regime change? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=458.08s)]
*  And should Chuck Schumer, a senator, be at the center of that? Gentlemen, there's so much more [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=462.0s)]
*  to talk about. I'll bring you back on another day. Again, the parents of an American hostage coming [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=466.79999999999995s)]
*  up a little bit later in this hour. Great to have you start off. Thank you. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcf4Gsq4dE&t=471.6s)]
