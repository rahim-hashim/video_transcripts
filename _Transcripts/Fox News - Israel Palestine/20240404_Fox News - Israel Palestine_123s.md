# Fox News' Peter Doocy grills White House on Biden's shifting Israel support
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azqIYIW_Ho)
*  The big news that came out of the briefing today and as well from Anthony Blinken, the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azqIYIW_Ho&t=0.0s)]
*  Secretary of State, is this notion that President Biden may change his policy toward Israel, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azqIYIW_Ho&t=4.12s)]
*  depending on how Israel conducts itself in the hours and days ahead. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azqIYIW_Ho&t=9.24s)]
*  Our Peter Ducey questioned the White House about that moments ago. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azqIYIW_Ho&t=13.36s)]
*  Let's listen to what happened. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azqIYIW_Ho&t=17.76s)]
*  On October 7th, President Biden said, my administration's support for Israel's security is rock solid [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azqIYIW_Ho&t=20.04s)]
*  and unwavering. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azqIYIW_Ho&t=26.86s)]
*  That is not true anymore, correct? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azqIYIW_Ho&t=28.74s)]
*  No, it is true. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azqIYIW_Ho&t=30.06s)]
*  Still true today. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azqIYIW_Ho&t=32.82s)]
*  How is his support unwavering, but you're also reconsidering policy choices? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azqIYIW_Ho&t=33.82s)]
*  Both can be true. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azqIYIW_Ho&t=40.1s)]
*  They cannot be true. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azqIYIW_Ho&t=41.1s)]
*  They're completely different things. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azqIYIW_Ho&t=42.1s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azqIYIW_Ho&t=43.9s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azqIYIW_Ho&t=44.9s)]
*  He is wavering. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azqIYIW_Ho&t=45.9s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azqIYIW_Ho&t=46.9s)]
*  Come on. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azqIYIW_Ho&t=47.9s)]
*  How is he not wavering? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azqIYIW_Ho&t=48.9s)]
*  Come on now. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azqIYIW_Ho&t=49.9s)]
*  As I said, and as it says in that readout, we made clear, and he made it clear to the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azqIYIW_Ho&t=51.1s)]
*  Prime Minister in his call, that our support for Israel's self-defense remains ironclad. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azqIYIW_Ho&t=58.12s)]
*  They face a range of threats, and the United States isn't going to walk away from helping [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azqIYIW_Ho&t=63.26s)]
*  Israel defend itself. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azqIYIW_Ho&t=68.4s)]
*  That said, you can say all that and you can act on that and you can believe that, and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azqIYIW_Ho&t=70.7s)]
*  the president does, and still believe that the manner in which they are defending themselves [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azqIYIW_Ho&t=75.5s)]
*  against the Hamas threat needs to change. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azqIYIW_Ho&t=81.02s)]
*  There's a lot of hair splitting in there, I think. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azqIYIW_Ho&t=83.94s)]
*  Exactly, and to Hal Tynerick's point, there's this continuous talk about possibly changing [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azqIYIW_Ho&t=87.94s)]
*  policy on all of this, but no details exactly what they mean. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azqIYIW_Ho&t=94.06s)]
*  So that would have been a good point of clarification for John Kirby. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azqIYIW_Ho&t=99.26s)]
*  Well, more clarification to come in the hours ahead here on Fox. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azqIYIW_Ho&t=103.5s)]
*  Hey everyone, I'm Emily Campagno. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azqIYIW_Ho&t=106.82000000000001s)]
