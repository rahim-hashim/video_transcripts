# Father of US man in Hamas custody: Where is the Red Cross?
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0)
*  So back to the breaking news. The war is back on now. If you've been following us for the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=0.0s)]
*  last hour or so, the U.S. pressing for a new ceasefire deal, but not at the moment. The [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=4.24s)]
*  Israeli Defense Forces are back operating in Gaza. The truce is done. The family of [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=8.76s)]
*  one of the remaining hostages is now praying for the return of their son. He is 19-year-old [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=13.44s)]
*  Itai Hen, an active duty IDF soldier and a U.S. Israeli citizen. He was serving with [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=18.68s)]
*  a tank unit near Gaza on the morning of the 7th of October. Has not been heard from since. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=25.68s)]
*  His father is Ruby. He's been back and forth to Washington, D.C. trying to bring his own [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=32.76s)]
*  son home. And Ruby, thank you for your time today. We're trying, Ruby, to get the message [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=38.24s)]
*  out here today. A couple of things I want to know from you. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=43.08s)]
*  Thanks for having me. Yeah, you bet. You say, get the hostages and [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=47.8s)]
*  then get Hamas at all costs. For the fate of your 19-year-old teenage son, when was [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  the last time you heard from him? It was that Black Saturday morning that we heard [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=61.68s)]
*  from him last, and since then, nothing. No sign of life. And we have made constantly [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=68.47999999999999s)]
*  the international-led costs. And we have been asking them. Part of the agreement that has [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=76.96s)]
*  been signed is that Hamas is supposed to provide them access to the remaining hostages, hostages [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=84.03999999999999s)]
*  that have gun wounds, that have amputated limbs, that have broken bones, that require [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  immediate medical attention. We are happy for those that have been united with their [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=95.83999999999999s)]
*  family, but those that have been left behind are dying each day without that medical attention. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=101.83999999999999s)]
*  And I ask, where is the international-led costs? Ruby, based on international law, who [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=109.48s)]
*  is allowed to meet with the hostages? So, according to the international law, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=119.28s)]
*  the international-led costs has a permanent mandate to visit hostages. If I could, Bill, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=127.4s)]
*  let's quote you the mission statement of the international-led costs to protect the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=134.36s)]
*  lives and dignity of victims in armed conflict and violence and provide them with assistance. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=139.20000000000002s)]
*  When you look at the budget of the international-led costs, 25 percent of it comes from U.S. taxpayers. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  I am a U.S. taxpayer. Why is it that the international-led costs has not visited my son, a U.S. citizen, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=155.84s)]
*  as well as the other hostages that require immediate medical attention? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=163.48s)]
*  The question is fair, sir. I am wondering whether the Israeli government can provide [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=168.44s)]
*  you on that, or is the reality here that Hamas just operates in its own silo, and they are [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=173.88s)]
*  controlling all of this for the hostages today? The international-led costs are the ones that [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  need to be the conscious of the international community. They are the ones that are seeing [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=186.6s)]
*  the hostages the minute that they are released, and they are coming back filthy, insect bites, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=193.4s)]
*  with starvation, and they are not telling the world how the hostages are being treated. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=203.24s)]
*  It sounds very much, Bill, unfortunately, like the Holocaust, where, again, the international [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=211.24s)]
*  community and the red costs did not share with the world what has happened. And only [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=218.24s)]
*  in the aftermath was the world aware of the horrific things that happened in the Holocaust. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  Where is the international-led costs? Why are they keeping quiet? Why are they not stating [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=234.32000000000002s)]
*  the status of the victims? And why are they not stating that they are not allowed access [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=239.76000000000002s)]
*  by Hamas to visit the hostages that are left behind that require immediate medical attention? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=245.84s)]
*  Why are they not saying to the world exactly what is happening? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=253.76000000000002s)]
*  I can hear it in your voice. Today is the first of December. We are coming up on two [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=256.96000000000004s)]
*  months of your son's captivity. And I know you are in Washington to put pressure on U.S. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=260.6s)]
*  officials to go ahead and get your answers. I don't know if there has been much consolation [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=265.36s)]
*  for you in Washington, D.C., but maybe I can ask you this question. Do you believe [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=269.04s)]
*  that this U.S. government is doing as best as it possibly can for your family and for [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=274.6s)]
*  the Israeli military that is trying to eliminate Hamas today? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=280.52000000000004s)]
*  So we have been having constant conversations with the Biden administration from the highest [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=285.96000000000004s)]
*  levels, from the president to the vice president. We met yesterday Jake Sullivan, again, that [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=290.84000000000003s)]
*  provided us as much insight as he can about the negotiations going on. We also met senators [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=297.56s)]
*  that are from both sides of the aisle. We believe that it is important to keep this [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=303.2s)]
*  a broad partisan issue as much as possible. And we have been getting support. Yesterday [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=308.32s)]
*  we met Senator Cruz. We met Senator Lindsey Graham. And they also wish to provide their [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=313.56s)]
*  support to solve this issue as soon as possible. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=320.47999999999996s)]
*  What the bottom line, Bill, is that there are eight U.S. hostages being held in captivity [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=324.66s)]
*  for 56 days. I'm a business guy. I look at the bottom line. And unfortunately, that is [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=331.66s)]
*  the bottom line as we speak after 56 days. We had Thanksgiving last week, Bill, time [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=338.18s)]
*  of family being together. We had an empty chair at the table. Christmas is coming up. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=344.26000000000005s)]
*  We don't want to have an empty chair again. The U.S. government needs to do whatever [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=350.98s)]
*  it can, negotiate whatever it can to get the hostages back out, especially the U.S. hostages. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=354.94s)]
*  I can't imagine what you're going through. Listen, stay strong, stay brave. Thank you [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=361.94s)]
*  for sharing your story today. And I know the only consolation for you in the end is when [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=366.48s)]
*  your 19-year-old son comes home and walks through that door again. So we pray for that. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=370.74s)]
*  Thank you, Bill. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=375.38s)]
*  For it to come back. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=376.38s)]
*  And again, the U.S. government needs to do whatever it can to leverage the international [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=377.38s)]
*  net cost to go out and do its job. Its job is to go out and visit those hostages and [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=380.86s)]
*  provide medical attention. They pay 25 percent of the budget. They should make that happen. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=385.86s)]
*  Understood. We'll see if you get that. And we'll stay on it. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=391.02000000000004s)]
*  Ruby, thank you for your time today. We'll stay in contact. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-RnOJRYeM0&t=394.46000000000004s)]
