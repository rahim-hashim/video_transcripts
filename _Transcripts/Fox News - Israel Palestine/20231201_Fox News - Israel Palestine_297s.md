# Biden admin under fire for undermining Israel: 'Shameful'
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw)
*  With that, let's bring in Morgan Ortega, former State Department spokesperson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=0.0s)]
*  So let's listen to what Antony Blinken said yesterday, Morgan, in Tel Aviv, where he appeared [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=3.52s)]
*  to telegraph to the Israeli leadership exactly what they wanted to hear. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  Listen here. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=12.8s)]
*  Israel has the right to do everything it can to ensure that the slaughter Hamas carried [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=13.8s)]
*  out on October 7th can never be repeated. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=19.2s)]
*  Hamas cannot remain in control of Gaza. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=22.92s)]
*  It cannot retain the capacity to repeat that carnage. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=25.4s)]
*  That was only underscored by this morning's appalling terrorist attack on people waiting [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=30.84s)]
*  at a bus stop in Jerusalem. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=34.64s)]
*  So he seems to be saying the right things in public, but the concern is that the backup [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=36.56s)]
*  from the Biden administration may not be there in the future. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  Well, I think what we're seeing, John, happen is what many of us were afraid of, which is [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=46.08s)]
*  that they would stand by our ally in the days and the weeks after October 7th. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=52.28s)]
*  But as the fighting began, that it would sort of start to become death by a thousand cuts. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=56.64s)]
*  And I do think you're seeing the Democrats on the left fall for the propaganda that's [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  been put out by Hamas. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=66.28s)]
*  And you're starting to see, especially in that leaked audio from the meeting that Blinken [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=68.8s)]
*  was in, it's kind of bizarre that that was leaked. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=72.68s)]
*  But what you saw whenever Blinken said, well, I'm not sure that you have the credit in order [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=75.44s)]
*  to continue to destroy Hamas. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=80.04s)]
*  I mean, that undermines Israel's entire objective. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=82.12s)]
*  Our objective when we went into Afghanistan after 9-11, what was our objective? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=87.04s)]
*  Is that we want to destroy Al-Qaeda and we wanted to make sure that Afghanistan was not [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=91.32s)]
*  a place from which the American homeland could be attacked again. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=96.16s)]
*  And they have similar goals, obviously, for Hamas. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  The Israeli people cannot live in fear of terrorist groups that are like Al-Qaeda or [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  like ISIS, groups that we fought so that they could not attack Americans as well. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=109.08s)]
*  So I would say today, and I don't say this lightly, I have worked for the last secretary [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=114.72s)]
*  of state, John, I try to be careful with my criticism of the current secretary of state [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=119.39999999999999s)]
*  and his team. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=123.72s)]
*  But some of the stuff that he is reportedly saying behind the scenes, I consider shameful. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=124.75999999999999s)]
*  And I consider it's selling our ally down the river, saying one thing publicly. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=130.04s)]
*  And that's what this administration constantly does, which is a communications exercise, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=134.32s)]
*  which is we're going to say one thing, but we're not necessarily going to back it up [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=138.76s)]
*  in actions behind the scenes. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=142.39999999999998s)]
*  And so Israel is left in a predicament. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=145.23999999999998s)]
*  I don't recall a Blinken flying to Ukraine every other week in order to micromanage their [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=148.51999999999998s)]
*  war, right, the way that he is doing to Israel. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=154.23999999999998s)]
*  And this is a sovereign state, right? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=156.76s)]
*  This is not a satellite state of America. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=158.64s)]
*  This is a sovereign state. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=160.39999999999998s)]
*  They are an ally. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=161.76s)]
*  But the micromanaging from the Biden administration, especially when they can't even get all of [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=162.76s)]
*  the American hostages back is too much. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=167.23999999999998s)]
*  It's gone too far. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=169.64s)]
*  Let me let me come back to the point that you were making there about what's being said [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=170.64s)]
*  behind closed doors and just add a little context and perspective to it, because you [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=173.56s)]
*  mentioned a transcript that was leaked. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  This transcript of the closed door meeting between Antony Blinken and the war cabinet [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=181.11999999999998s)]
*  was leaked to Channel 12 in Israel and then reported on by the Times of Israel. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=185.07999999999998s)]
*  Listen to this exchange. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=192.23999999999998s)]
*  And this is the one that you alluded to. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=193.23999999999998s)]
*  The defense minister, Yoav Galant, apparently says in this meeting, the entire Israeli society [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=195.07999999999998s)]
*  is united behind the goal of dismantling Hamas, even if it takes months. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=200.04s)]
*  Antony Blinken's response, I don't think you have the credit for that. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=205.95999999999998s)]
*  As a former State Department employee and spokesperson for the former secretary, decode [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=211.23999999999998s)]
*  that for us. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=216.64s)]
*  What what's he saying? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=217.64s)]
*  It's hard to know what he means by the credit, but I think he is essentially saying that [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=221.48s)]
*  you don't have the political capital on the international stage to be able to actually [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=225.64s)]
*  destroy Hamas. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=230.56s)]
*  And if that's what this administration really thinks behind the scenes, that is a massive [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=231.64s)]
*  problem. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=236.2s)]
*  You know, we we have all been worried that it would be death by a thousand cuts and that [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=237.2s)]
*  when things got really tough for Israel in their fight against Hamas, that the administration [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=241.12s)]
*  wouldn't stand behind them. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=245.8s)]
*  You know, I'm also concerned about how politics may be playing into this, John. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=247.24s)]
*  We know that the president is underwater in his approval ratings. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=251.32s)]
*  We know that he is losing to former President Trump. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=255.07999999999998s)]
*  Michigan is going to be a critical state. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=258.12s)]
*  Reportedly, Democrats in Michigan, especially those that are pro-Palestinian, are not supportive [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=260.2s)]
*  of the president's actions towards Israel. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=265.76s)]
*  So part of me wonders if this administration is starting to pay politics because they're [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=268.28s)]
*  worried about their poll numbers in Michigan. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=271.92s)]
*  Yeah, you mentioned Ukraine. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=273.71999999999997s)]
*  I mean, I don't think that the president is too worried about the Russian vote in the [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=275.0s)]
*  United States, but he certainly is worried about the Arab-American vote. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=278.4s)]
*  Morgan, good to see you. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=281.44s)]
*  Hope you have a good weekend. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=282.59999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=283.59999999999997s)]
*  Thanks, John. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRr5PSxPKMw&t=284.59999999999997s)]
