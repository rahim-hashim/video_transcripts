*  This has been a harrowing experience for so many Israelis as they look at [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salmwjB2Ktg&t=73.16s)]
*  At the situation in Gaza and they saw more than [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salmwjB2Ktg&t=77.8s)]
*  470 days it took to get these young women out of Gaza and Hamas used this [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salmwjB2Ktg&t=81.88s)]
*  Opportunity to try and show the international community that they're organized inside the Gaza Strip [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salmwjB2Ktg&t=87.47999999999999s)]
*  But the Israelis are saying they are not holding up their end of the bargain [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salmwjB2Ktg&t=92.72s)]
*  There was supposed to be one other Israeli civilian that was supposed to be released today [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salmwjB2Ktg&t=96.84s)]
*  She was not released and as a result the Israelis have announced they are not going to let [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salmwjB2Ktg&t=101.0s)]
*  Palestinian civilians cross from southern to northern Gaza one of the key ceasefire agreements this could certainly [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salmwjB2Ktg&t=106.0s)]
*  Create some tension between Hamas and Israel [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salmwjB2Ktg&t=113.44s)]
*  But Israeli officials say look they are not holding up to their end of the bargain and they want to be very strict in the early [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salmwjB2Ktg&t=116.36s)]
*  Part of the ceasefire agreement to ensure that Hamas and Islamic Jihad are adhering to the deal guys [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salmwjB2Ktg&t=121.64s)]
*  Trey I'm so happy for those four young women and it just is terrifying to see them paraded that way the guys with the guns [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salmwjB2Ktg&t=127.88000000000001s)]
*  I know that you talked earlier about how this was a PR opportunity. I don't understand the PR [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salmwjB2Ktg&t=134.92s)]
*  I think it's a really bad look for Hamas to say the least my question [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salmwjB2Ktg&t=140.6s)]
*  You is why is the there's a baby and a five-year-old and the baby's five-year-old brother who are still among the hostages [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salmwjB2Ktg&t=145.07999999999998s)]
*  Any idea why they were not part of this group that was released today because this is just outrageous [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salmwjB2Ktg&t=152.27999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, we have some information about this specific family [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salmwjB2Ktg&t=158.6s)]
*  But we'll wait for the Israeli army to announce the information the reality is that as this war developed [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salmwjB2Ktg&t=162.4s)]
*  Many of these vulnerable hostages were taken into tunnels and into houses as the fighting raged on [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salmwjB2Ktg&t=168.35999999999999s)]
*  Inside Gaza and they were not protected by Hamas [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salmwjB2Ktg&t=174.28s)]
*  And so this particular family is one that really became a symbol for the Israelis the bebis children two brothers and their mother [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salmwjB2Ktg&t=177.48s)]
*  Just she was holding them in the small town of Kafaraza that sits along the Gaza border [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salmwjB2Ktg&t=186.08s)]
*  And this video circulated of these two boys with red hair as they were taken into Gaza [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salmwjB2Ktg&t=190.88s)]
*  And they once again have been used this specific family as a propaganda tool by Hamas [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salmwjB2Ktg&t=196.08s)]
*  They have often released hostage videos of the husband of this this mother [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salmwjB2Ktg&t=202.84s)]
*  Saying that the family had been killed and just creating this kind of a propaganda tool [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salmwjB2Ktg&t=208.4s)]
*  And so we don't have any information publicly available to announce about this particular family [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salmwjB2Ktg&t=213.51999999999998s)]
*  But it is just horrible when you think about how this country is just waiting to see not only what happened to them [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salmwjB2Ktg&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  But also the rest of the hostages that remain in Hamas captivity [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salmwjB2Ktg&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  To catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salmwjB2Ktg&t=243.48s)]
