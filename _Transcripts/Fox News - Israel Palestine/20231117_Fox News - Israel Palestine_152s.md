# Wealthy Marxist couple funds anti-Israel rage: Report
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvyueH1I7l0)
*  All right. House Republicans are launching an investigation into the anti-war group Code [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvyueH1I7l0&t=0.0s)]
*  Pink. They've disrupted recent hearings on Capitol Hill, including the one with Secretary [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvyueH1I7l0&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  of State Blinken. And we're now learning one of the group's founders may have ties to the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvyueH1I7l0&t=10.96s)]
*  Communist Chinese party. Oh great. Griff Jenkins is live in Washington. So what do you know, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvyueH1I7l0&t=17.16s)]
*  Griff? Well, we're learning, Lawrence, and good morning, guys. Great show there in Nashville. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvyueH1I7l0&t=23.48s)]
*  We're learning more about who's behind groups like Code Pink specifically, and it appears they are [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvyueH1I7l0&t=27.74s)]
*  far less organic than meets the eye. Now, that Code Pink rally in D.C. yesterday you're looking [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvyueH1I7l0&t=32.82s)]
*  at, that was organized by co-founder Jodie Evans. I first met her, by the way, in 2003 when Code [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvyueH1I7l0&t=38.22s)]
*  Pink was founded to oppose George W. Bush's war in Iraq. Since then, it has grown into being a [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvyueH1I7l0&t=45.019999999999996s)]
*  major player on the protest front and socialist Marxist circles, and they've got deep pockets. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvyueH1I7l0&t=50.86s)]
*  They're bankrolled heavily by Jodie Evans's husband, as the New York Post describes. You see [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvyueH1I7l0&t=56.62s)]
*  him here as an uber-wealthy American-born tech entrepreneur named Neville Roy Singham. Evans was [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvyueH1I7l0&t=61.339999999999996s)]
*  linked this week to another group called People's Forum, who claims to advocate for marginalized [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvyueH1I7l0&t=69.02s)]
*  communities and social justice. But they've been very active in organizing at least four of the big [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvyueH1I7l0&t=74.14s)]
*  protests we've seen here in D.C. and there in New York in recent weeks. Now, this comes as the New [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvyueH1I7l0&t=80.22s)]
*  York Times investigation linked Evans's husband to four nonprofits, which peddle Chinese Communist [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvyueH1I7l0&t=85.82s)]
*  Party propaganda. Interestingly, back in the summer, Evans was making the case that President [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvyueH1I7l0&t=92.22s)]
*  Xi isn't such a bad guy after all. Watch. The governing structure of China is such that, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvyueH1I7l0&t=98.05999999999999s)]
*  I mean, I understand, you know, after learning it, realizing like Xi has way less power than Biden. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvyueH1I7l0&t=106.38s)]
*  He's not such a scary guy, she says. Now, the takeaway here and what the House Republicans and [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvyueH1I7l0&t=112.78s)]
*  others want to know is, where does the money come from? Follow the money. It's an old adage, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvyueH1I7l0&t=117.58s)]
*  but it does certainly hold up in this case because Evans and her husband that we just showed you there [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvyueH1I7l0&t=122.62s)]
*  are quite the power couple in the socialist Marxist circles in bankrolling some of these [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvyueH1I7l0&t=128.22s)]
*  far-left causes. Obviously, pro-Palestinian marches are the order of the day. Guys, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvyueH1I7l0&t=135.26s)]
*  I'll send it back to you. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvyueH1I7l0&t=139.98000000000002s)]

*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvyueH1I7l0&t=142.54s)]
