# This 'hostage headache' is a 'Carter-era hostage headache': Ex-special envoy
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [September 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U)
*  All right, with more on talks of a possible deal, our next guest served as the envoy for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=0.0s)]
*  hostage affairs in the Trump administration. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=4.16s)]
*  Hugh Dugan joins us now by phone. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=6.88s)]
*  Hugh, thanks for being here. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=9.0s)]
*  You heard what Trey just reported. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=10.82s)]
*  Is this a moment for a deal, or will Israel be forced into a bad deal that ultimately [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  means Hamas is not eradicated? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=18.76s)]
*  You get some hostages back, but the situation doesn't change. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=21.04s)]
*  Israel is facing a very difficult situation, obviously, and within their cabinet as well. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=24.68s)]
*  We also have a meeting in our situation room today among our cabinet members dealing with [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=29.36s)]
*  this issue. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=33.88s)]
*  And it may very well be that the negotiations within those separate cabinet rooms could [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=34.88s)]
*  be as intractable as negotiations with the enemy, because in our case, we need an all-of-government [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=38.84s)]
*  response. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=45.04s)]
*  Every agency has to give up an equity or two to make this happen. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=46.2s)]
*  That's a tough negotiation in any hostage deal, I'm sorry to admit. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  And Netanyahu is facing his own local opponents, and even the public can understand a general [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=53.64s)]
*  strike today. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=58.760000000000005s)]
*  So it's a very tenuous situation. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  Unfortunately, Hamas seems to put people where they want them. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  They want to destabilize, question our presence in the region, and weaken Israel to the point [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=65.12s)]
*  of destruction. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=70.0s)]
*  You know, Hugh, I'm just curious. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=71.0s)]
*  You know, we talk about this situation room meeting today. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=72.8s)]
*  Why the delay? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=79.4s)]
*  I mean, we have the best HR teams in the world. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=80.4s)]
*  We train with the Israelis as well. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  There has been no effort to rescue the Americans that are there. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=86.7s)]
*  There's no talk about the devs going in, Navy SEALs going in. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=90.38000000000001s)]
*  It seems like this administration is putting on this meeting today for show, because there's [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=94.02000000000001s)]
*  been no effort to bring our people back home. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=99.62s)]
*  I quite agree. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=103.5s)]
*  It appears that way to the public. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=104.5s)]
*  I hope otherwise, that there have been assiduous and careful attention given. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=106.06s)]
*  But I have not heard the word rescue since you just mentioned it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=110.22s)]
*  And when we deal with terrorists, that's our first course of action, rescue, because [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=113.22s)]
*  our policy is not to negotiate with terrorists. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=117.38s)]
*  And we've been playing this funny dance with triangulating the issue with Hamas, Qatar, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=119.86s)]
*  Kuwait, other countries through whom we speak to the terrorists. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=124.7s)]
*  But in the end, it's a losing proposition to deal with terrorists. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=129.22s)]
*  They only have something to gain when disaster strikes, and they will orchestrate more as [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=132.14s)]
*  they did with these murders, which were meant to provoke us into this tight spot and to [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=136.26s)]
*  force us to bend our knee to them in public, to give them a rallying cry among their own, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=142.14000000000001s)]
*  and to show that they're in control of the situation, even though the situation is perverse. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=147.58s)]
*  And sir, to that point, at what point has our administration actually, you could argue, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=152.82s)]
*  been complicit with Hamas's and the Islamic Republic's objectives in that we have encouraged [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=157.3s)]
*  that global condemnation, the restraint of Israel in its response? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=164.14000000000001s)]
*  If we don't negotiate with terrorists, if there should have been a stronger response, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=168.02s)]
*  then why is the American government coming out and instead of being staunchly supportive [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=170.85999999999999s)]
*  of our ally, why were we conditioning any type of support and urging them to exercise [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=174.29999999999998s)]
*  restraint? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=179.62s)]
*  Well, I think you're going to see something happen in America these next couple of days. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=180.62s)]
*  The sympathetic tide toward Israel will turn back toward Israel where it needs to be. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=185.42s)]
*  And we're going to find this Harris-Waltz ticket pretty seriously challenged in having [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=189.7s)]
*  to abandon their far left, perhaps. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=196.34s)]
*  What Hamas has engineered here is not just interference in our foreign affairs, but actually [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=198.9s)]
*  election interference. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=203.46s)]
*  The timing of this comes at a point that puts our candidates in a very tight spot. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=205.18s)]
*  And it may help Trump, it may hurt Trump, but I think Iran wants to help Harris and [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=210.74s)]
*  Biden. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=215.62s)]
*  So I predict perhaps a breakthrough that we can tout as a breakthrough in the meantime [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=216.62s)]
*  to get us through the next several weeks toward the electoral cycle. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=221.22000000000003s)]
*  But the public needs to remain indignant and angry about the fact that an American [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=224.56s)]
*  was killed yesterday, not a hyphenated American, not an Israeli American, an American. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=228.8s)]
*  And there are seven left. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=233.68s)]
*  This is October 7th is coming. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=235.32s)]
*  It'll be a year. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=237.08s)]
*  And if we go up to inauguration day, that will be 471 days. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=238.12s)]
*  We were only in Iran with our hostages at the embassy way back when for 444 days. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=243.6s)]
*  I see that this hostage headache is a Carter era hostage headache that's going to plague [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=249.92s)]
*  the White House until probably inauguration day where we might see a big change in Washington. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=254.8s)]
*  Hugh Dugan, thank you for your insight. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=261.12s)]
*  You know what you're talking about. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=264.4s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=265.4s)]
*  Thanks Hugh. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=266.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpDLf-YK6U&t=267.4s)]
