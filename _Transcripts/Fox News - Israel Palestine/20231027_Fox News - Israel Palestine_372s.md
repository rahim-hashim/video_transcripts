# McEnany: Let's be very clear. These are lies.
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ)
*  We are now learning U.S. troops in Iraq shot down a one-way combat drone earlier today [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=0.0s)]
*  in what appears to be another attempted attack on our troops in the region. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=6.76s)]
*  This comes as the Pentagon started hitting back at the Iran proxy groups, leading these [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=11.28s)]
*  aggressions that happened last night. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=15.46s)]
*  Early this morning, U.S. warplanes conducted airstrikes on two Iran-backed locations in [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=17.92s)]
*  eastern Syria. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=23.06s)]
*  That news breaking late last night. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=24.76s)]
*  And one facility was used by Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps for weapon storage. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=26.7s)]
*  The other was an ammo production factory. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=31.7s)]
*  The Pentagon is calling the strikes an act of self-defense. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=34.42s)]
*  And in just the past 10 days, listen to this, 10 days, Iran-backed proxies have launched [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=37.94s)]
*  20, yes, 20 attacks on American troops in Iraq and Syria. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=43.7s)]
*  And while war rages on between Israel and Hamas, Iran is demanding the United States [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=49.78s)]
*  stop supporting our ally or be prepared to face more fire. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=54.86s)]
*  I say frankly to the American statesmen who are now managing the genocide in Palestine [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=59.94s)]
*  that we do not welcome to expansion of the war in the region. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=70.78s)]
*  But I warn if the genocide in Gaza continues, they will not be spared from this fire. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=77.54s)]
*  We want to be crystal clear. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=87.9s)]
*  There is no genocide being waged by Israel. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=89.5s)]
*  Those were lies. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=93.36000000000001s)]
*  In fact, it is Israelis who were ruthlessly attacked by Hamas. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=94.36000000000001s)]
*  Let's bring in retired U.S. Army General Keith Kellogg, Fox News contributor and former national [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=98.06s)]
*  security adviser to former Vice President Mike Pence. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=102.78s)]
*  General Kellogg, you know, 10 days, 20 attacks on U.S. troops. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=106.88s)]
*  In fact, we know that 19 U.S. troops were diagnosed with traumatic brain injury. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=113.08s)]
*  Why did it take 10 days for the U.S. to respond? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=118.16s)]
*  Well, Kayleigh, thanks for having me. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=120.96s)]
*  Look, it shouldn't have. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=122.88s)]
*  You're involved right now in what's called escalation control, risk management and strategic [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=124.52s)]
*  leadership. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=129.12s)]
*  And we've got a problem in all three. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=130.12s)]
*  A response by two F-16s is not really good. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=133.0s)]
*  We learned that in the past. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=136.28s)]
*  Let me give you an example. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=137.28s)]
*  In 2019 in December, we had an attack by Iranian proxy forces on a base in Erbil in Iraq, killed [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=138.28s)]
*  an American. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=146.32000000000002s)]
*  We responded with heavy fires through F-15 strike eagles. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=147.32000000000002s)]
*  Two days later, the American embassy is under attack. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=152.20000000000002s)]
*  And I got a call at 3 o'clock in the morning from the Situation Room. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=154.64000000000001s)]
*  Robert O'Brien, the national security adviser to the president, is on the other line. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=159.60000000000002s)]
*  We knew that they were starting to burn documents, which was the precursor to losing an embassy. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=163.28s)]
*  We said, let's wake the principals. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=167.24s)]
*  So he wakes up the president. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=168.94s)]
*  I wake up the vice president. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=170.16s)]
*  And we say at the time, here's what's happening. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=171.72s)]
*  And the president says to us, who's involved? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=174.12s)]
*  We say, it's Soleimani. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=176.76000000000002s)]
*  He says, get Soleimani. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=178.6s)]
*  So in the process of getting Soleimani, which happened two days later, we took him out. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=180.04000000000002s)]
*  And then we said, OK, here's the next steps. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=185.88s)]
*  And with strategic leadership by the president, here's what you do. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=188.08s)]
*  And he said publicly to the world, there are 52 targets in Iran that we're going to go [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=191.32s)]
*  after if this continues. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=195.0s)]
*  Subsequently also, the secretary of state passed a message through the Swiss, who are [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=197.04s)]
*  protecting power, which means our emissaries, because we don't have any diplomatic relations [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=202.16s)]
*  with the Iranians, that the next target is the supreme leader, Khamenei. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=206.79999999999998s)]
*  He's going to be gone. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=211.2s)]
*  So why do we know that worked? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=212.2s)]
*  And why did everybody quiet down? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=213.68s)]
*  Eight days later, the Iranians shot down a Ukrainian airliner coming out of Iran. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=215.44s)]
*  And why? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=221.28s)]
*  We pick up the signals that they thought we were coming after the supreme leader. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=222.28s)]
*  We took decisive action, hard action, and we basically broke the escalation ladder by [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=225.67999999999998s)]
*  going superescalation. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=230.79999999999998s)]
*  That's what they need to do now. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=232.39999999999998s)]
*  They need to send a very clear message, a very hard message. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=233.67999999999998s)]
*  And two F-16s in response is not that message. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=237.0s)]
*  They need to nip this in the bud. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=239.95999999999998s)]
*  And we need to tell the supreme leader, and very clearly, you're on the docket, dude. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=241.56s)]
*  We're coming after you if necessary. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=247.04s)]
*  And we're going after your infrastructure and we're going to go after the people as [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=248.67999999999998s)]
*  well, to include the leader of the Quds Force, which is Ismail Ghani right now. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=251.39999999999998s)]
*  And you also tell their foreign minister, who's at the UN, that, you know, look, right [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=257.28s)]
*  now you're going to be next as well. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=262.12s)]
*  And if we don't send that message, you don't break this escalation ladder. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=264.88s)]
*  And you've got to break it now or it's going to spin out of control. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=269.2s)]
*  That's my concern, Kayleigh. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=272.44s)]
*  It's going to spin out of control. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=273.91999999999996s)]
*  And then it's going to be much more hard to contain and it's going to get worse. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=275.54s)]
*  I want to underscore what you just said. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=279.70000000000005s)]
*  That was fascinating. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=281.6s)]
*  So the United States, you believed it's being targeted. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=283.5s)]
*  You laid out what was happening at the embassy. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=285.98s)]
*  You wake up former President Trump within, if I understand you correctly, within 48 hours, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=288.0s)]
*  Soleimani is gone, 48 hours. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=293.46000000000004s)]
*  And compare that to Biden's response to this Hamas attack and the attack on our U.S. troops, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=296.5s)]
*  is what we're told by Lloyd Austin. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=302.02s)]
*  Ten days for a U.S. response. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=304.06s)]
*  Ten days. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=306.85999999999996s)]
*  And that's $6 billion still not categorically cut off that was unleashed. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=307.85999999999996s)]
*  The oil sanctions not being enforced. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=311.78s)]
*  What a comparison. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=314.21999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=315.21999999999997s)]
*  And Kayleigh, look, it was ten days when we broke the cycle. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=316.21999999999997s)]
*  Everything quieted down right after that. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=319.91999999999996s)]
*  If you remember, go back and look at the timeline from when that attack occurred in Iribeel [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=321.26s)]
*  to when the Iranians decided to call it all off, was a ten-day period. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=325.7s)]
*  We had made a very, very clear message to everybody. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=330.26s)]
*  And here's the other thing that's very important, is everybody in the world knew that the President [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=332.62s)]
*  of the United States would take decisive action. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=337.21999999999997s)]
*  And we did it by killing the Kredsforz commander, Soleimani, who was probably the most charismatic [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=339.65999999999997s)]
*  general the Iranians had, and that the Khamenei was next. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=344.14s)]
*  And we let everybody in the world know about it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=347.47999999999996s)]
*  Pompeo made sure everybody in the world knew about it. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=349.74s)]
*  We knew that the Russians knew about it. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=352.38s)]
*  We knew the Iranians knew about it. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=354.08s)]
*  We knew all our allies knew about it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=355.62s)]
*  And it broke the cycle. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=356.94s)]
*  That's what they need to do. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=358.32s)]
*  They're not doing it. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=359.36s)]
*  And this is going to continue to spin, and you're going to see more attacks on American [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=360.48s)]
*  servicemen, women, and also our installations. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=364.2s)]
*  Yeah, we certainly hope not. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=367.12s)]
*  General Keith Kellogg, thank you very much. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=369.24s)]
*  Thanks, Kayleigh. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edHu9nxzsLQ&t=370.84000000000003s)]
