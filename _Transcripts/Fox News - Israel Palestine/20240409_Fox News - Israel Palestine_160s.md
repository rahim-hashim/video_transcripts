# Netanyahu 'forging ahead' with Rafah invasion despite Biden's opposition
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM)
*  But first, Israel is regrouping and gathering its strength to invade the last Hamas stronghold [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=0.0s)]
*  in the Gaza city of Ra'a. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=5.68s)]
*  Now, Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the date is set for his long-promised [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=7.4s)]
*  offensive. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=12.5s)]
*  And welcome to a brand new hour of America's Newsroom. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=13.5s)]
*  I'm Dana Perino. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=15.36s)]
*  Good morning to you. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=16.36s)]
*  Interesting morning so far, huh? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=17.36s)]
*  On Bill Hemmer, good morning. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  The Israeli leader forging ahead despite President Biden's pressure to hold off against invading [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=20.32s)]
*  Ra'a to take out the Iranian-backed terror group. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  They say that Biden's criticism of the offensive is tying the hands of our closest ally in [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=29.28s)]
*  the Middle East, which only encourages Hamas to dig in its heels and rejecting a ceasefire [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=33.760000000000005s)]
*  deal. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=38.8s)]
*  But the Biden State Department's not buying it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=39.8s)]
*  We have made clear to Israel that we think a full-scale military invasion of Ra'a would [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  have an enormously harmful effect on those civilians and that it would ultimately hurt [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=49.6s)]
*  Israel's security. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=55.28s)]
*  Let's get to Trey Yanks. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=57.28s)]
*  He's live in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=58.28s)]
*  As a lot of this news is swirling right now, as Netanyahu says, there's a date? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=59.28s)]
*  Yeah, Dana, good morning. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=63.68s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says his troops will enter Gaza's southernmost [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=66.68s)]
*  city of Ra'a. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=71.52s)]
*  You can hear off in the distance there a military helicopter back and forth along the Mediterranean [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=72.8s)]
*  Sea. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=77.72s)]
*  Right now, there are currently 1.4 million Palestinians sheltering in this southern area [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=78.72s)]
*  of the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=84.44s)]
*  It's not clear when they will be evacuated and how long that process might take, but [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=86.64s)]
*  this is a consequential decision if it does take place for a variety of reasons. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=90.8s)]
*  Netanyahu says the move to destroy remaining Hamas battalions is needed to win the war. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=95.11999999999999s)]
*  This victory requires entering Ra'a and eliminating the terrorist battalions there. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=100.52s)]
*  This will happen. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=106.88s)]
*  There is a date. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=107.88s)]
*  Since day 186 of the war between Israel and Hamas, the amount of aid going into Gaza is [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=111.4s)]
*  slowly increasing with more than 400 trucks entering the enclave on Monday. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=116.4s)]
*  After IDF soldiers withdrew from southern Gaza over the weekend, some Palestinian civilians [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=121.36000000000001s)]
*  returned to the wreckage of their homes in the city of Hanunis. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=125.88000000000001s)]
*  Recent reports estimate more than 50 percent of buildings in Gaza were damaged or destroyed [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=129.4s)]
*  since October 7th. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=134.16s)]
*  While the focus for Israel remains on the southern front, Israeli forces are on high [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=136.0s)]
*  alert in the north amid continued attacks from the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=140.20000000000002s)]
*  Hezbollah. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=144.84s)]
*  Dana? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufeHZ0UBfM&t=145.84s)]
