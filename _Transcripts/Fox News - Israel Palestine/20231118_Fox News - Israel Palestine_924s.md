# Mark Levin: These dictatorships seek to survive
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls)
*  Hello America, I'm Mark Levin and this is Life, Liberty and Levin. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=0.0s)]
*  I have a very serious question I want you to think about. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=3.0s)]
*  It should have a very easy answer, but it doesn't. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=5.76s)]
*  What is Joe Biden's foreign policy? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=9.26s)]
*  Can anybody define it? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=11.84s)]
*  Can anybody give it some contour, some explanation as it applies to one region of the world after [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=14.36s)]
*  another? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=19.68s)]
*  Foreign policy should be based on a word that I use all the time, prudence, not ideology. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=21.62s)]
*  I don't think you could call Joe Biden's foreign policy prudential, given all the wars that [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=28.68s)]
*  are going on, and he's lit the fuse to many of them. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=34.64s)]
*  Let's look at the Middle East for a moment. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=37.92s)]
*  Syria is in the middle of a civil war. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=41.08s)]
*  It has slaughtered anywhere from 300,000 to 500,000 of its own citizens. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=43.04s)]
*  I don't remember Joe Biden giving a speech telling them to stop killing citizens and [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=48.68s)]
*  to start to protect them. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=53.08s)]
*  Iran's in the middle of a civil war. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=55.28s)]
*  They're slaughtering people there as well. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=57.28s)]
*  They are a surrogate for Iran. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=59.06s)]
*  They are shooting missiles as well as sending drones to kill American soldiers, for which [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=62.0s)]
*  they're not paying any price. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=68.28s)]
*  Lebanon had a civil war. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=70.16s)]
*  Hezbollah basically has won it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=72.52000000000001s)]
*  It effectively controls that government, even though there's some tension. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=75.04s)]
*  Their economy is literally crashing, which is one of the reasons why Hezbollah, should [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=78.0s)]
*  will not have a lot of support from the Lebanese. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=84.26s)]
*  Egypt's economy is crashing, crashing. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=88.14s)]
*  Of course, Iran is thriving. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=90.94s)]
*  Iran is the glimmering light of economic expansion and prosperity thanks to the funding by Joe [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=95.7s)]
*  Biden, tens of billions of dollars for nothing. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=101.1s)]
*  Michael Duran, who I had on here the other weekend, he wrote about the plan by Obama, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=104.98s)]
*  rather than Biden, Blinken, Sullivan, and the other reprobates. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=111.38s)]
*  He called it the realignment of the Middle East. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=115.86s)]
*  Now, these kinds of things can only be baked up in kitchens in Ivy Towers or Ivy League [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=118.02s)]
*  schools or what I call Poison Ivy League schools. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=124.94s)]
*  You basically have different Arab countries with different leaders. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=129.2s)]
*  Some of them have military dictatorships. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=134.34s)]
*  Some of them have monarchies. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=136.57999999999998s)]
*  Some of them are relatively recent, in the timeline in the Middle East, like the dictator [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=138.88s)]
*  who's in Egypt and so forth. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  Some of them were created in the 1920s, like Saudi Arabia and Jordan. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=146.76s)]
*  Romanacs were put in place by the British and others. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=151.4s)]
*  Some of them go back much further. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=155.44s)]
*  So when we treat the Arabs, the Muslims, these countries, as if they're all one in the same [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=158.04s)]
*  They're not, except for this. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=164.52s)]
*  They will do anything to survive. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=168.1s)]
*  The monarchies seek to survive. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=170.92000000000002s)]
*  It's one inbred to the next. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  The military dictatorships seek to survive, or they'll be knocked off by another military [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=176.32s)]
*  dictatorship or maybe the Muslim Brotherhood or something like that. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=181.44s)]
*  Iran is not an Arab country. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=186.52s)]
*  It's Persian. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=189.72s)]
*  It's trying to build a caliphate to control those Arab countries and other Muslim countries [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=191.4s)]
*  to not share their Muslim sect. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=197.02s)]
*  It's very complex. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=199.76s)]
*  It's very complicated. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=201.32s)]
*  But that doesn't make the difference between good and evil complicated. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=203.32s)]
*  That's actually very simple. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=207.58s)]
*  There's not a single democracy among the Arab states. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=209.76s)]
*  Not one. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=214.24s)]
*  Not one. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=216.64000000000001s)]
*  That they have in common. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=217.72s)]
*  There are two. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=219.62s)]
*  Many of them, but not all of them, will do anything to survive. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=220.62s)]
*  Even if it means paying billions of dollars to Hamas or some other terrorist entities [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=225.46s)]
*  to try and buy peace, they'll do what they have to do. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=229.96s)]
*  Even if it means piling on Israel, even though some of them are praying that Israel defeats [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=234.06s)]
*  Hamas once and for all so Hamas cannot build the caliphate that it wishes to build. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=240.38s)]
*  Many of them quietly and secretly want Israel to eventually take on or take out Iran, which [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=248.48s)]
*  they all fear. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=254.32s)]
*  Because again, look at what's going on in Yemen. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=256.38s)]
*  In fact, look at what's going on in Iraq. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=258.06s)]
*  The Democracy Project. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=260.32s)]
*  Another project. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=262.56s)]
*  Really, they came out of textbooks scholars wrote about. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=263.56s)]
*  Will spread democracy in a part of the world that's never really experienced it except [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=267.6s)]
*  one. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=271.62s)]
*  Israel. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=272.62s)]
*  Many of the so-called moderate Arab states, therefore, they say one thing in public and [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=274.58s)]
*  do another thing in private. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=280.78000000000003s)]
*  But they're out for their own interests. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=282.78000000000003s)]
*  The problem with the Biden administration is it treats these countries as a conglomerate [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=285.02s)]
*  in the aggregate. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=290.7s)]
*  And so as best as I can tell, what the Biden foreign policy is, is the foreign policy of [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=292.7s)]
*  an arsonist. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=299.54s)]
*  Now why do I say that? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=300.54s)]
*  Because they blew up the Middle East. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=302.34000000000003s)]
*  They went from Obama's effort to re-engineer the entire region to Donald Trump who said, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=305.22s)]
*  that's crap. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=312.02000000000004s)]
*  Let's get down to basics. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=313.3s)]
*  Let's deal with practicality. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=314.46000000000004s)]
*  There are countries that want peace. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=315.46000000000004s)]
*  There's countries that don't. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=317.02000000000004s)]
*  It's clear the Palestinians don't. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=318.70000000000005s)]
*  Let's work around them and let's deal with those countries that do. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=321.06s)]
*  And then they can work out Israel with our help in these Arab countries' individual peace [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=324.78000000000003s)]
*  arrangements, which became known as the Abraham Accords. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=329.74s)]
*  So Trump, throughout the entire playbook, the entire playbook's been totally wrong. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=332.78s)]
*  And he certainly threw out Obama's playbook because that was insane. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=337.74s)]
*  But now Biden's in office, he takes Obama's playbook, and he's in chapter, probably the [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=343.86s)]
*  epilogue near the end. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=348.7s)]
*  He's got the same failed moronic reprobates around him that Obama did. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=350.53999999999996s)]
*  It's my view that Obama is calling the shots in many, many respects, given Biden's obvious [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=357.46000000000004s)]
*  mental condition. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=362.22s)]
*  So what is it that Biden wants to achieve in the Middle East? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=363.98s)]
*  They kind of said it. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=368.1s)]
*  They want an assimilation. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=370.66s)]
*  They want an assimilation between the so-called moderate Arab states and Israel. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=373.1s)]
*  Assimilate what? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=378.58000000000004s)]
*  Assimilate their economies. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=380.3s)]
*  Assimilate their militaries. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=383.26s)]
*  Assimilate their national security interests, as Duran says, to rebalance the Middle East. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=386.86s)]
*  And in order to do that, Israel has to be weakened and other countries have to be strengthened. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=392.21999999999997s)]
*  Gets worse. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=398.46s)]
*  And in the Biden-Obama, and before that the Obama-Biden ideology, Iran has to be built [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=401.26s)]
*  up. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=408.58s)]
*  Iran has to be the counterbalance in order to achieve all these fantastic efforts at [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=410.34s)]
*  assimilation that are going to spring from it. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=417.02s)]
*  Of course, it's nuts, but this is what they're doing. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=419.73999999999995s)]
*  This is what they believe. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=422.97999999999996s)]
*  So Iran has been rearmed by the United States, by Joe Biden. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=424.82s)]
*  The Iranian people have been put down. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=431.26s)]
*  They rose up to overthrow that government. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=433.65999999999997s)]
*  They've been put down because of the money they've received and the support they've [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=435.53999999999996s)]
*  received from Biden and his regime. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=439.86s)]
*  They showed no support, no interest in the real freedom fighters, the people, the teenage [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=443.66s)]
*  girls that were rising up to try and overthrow that regime. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=449.1s)]
*  So now they have an iron grasp over their own people. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=452.14s)]
*  And with Iran, Biden's policy is disastrous. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=456.14s)]
*  He's been at the point of the spear on appeasement. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=461.62s)]
*  We have nuclear appeasement with Iran. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=465.5s)]
*  Iran's going to get a nuclear weapon, and we're not going to stop them. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=467.53999999999996s)]
*  It's going to be up to little Israel once again. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=471.02s)]
*  And they're going to be under pressure by the United States not to do it. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=472.97999999999996s)]
*  With economic appeasement, where all kinds of trade routes have been open to Iran, where [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=476.97999999999996s)]

*  90 percent of the oil Iran sells goes to China, all trade restrictions essentially have been [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=489.58s)]

*  All have been waived. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=501.62s)]

*  While they're attacking American soldiers, we're sending them billions and billions [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=509.1s)]

*  At the same time, they're trying to push Israel not to defeat Hamas in a hundred different [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=545.9399999999999s)]
*  ways. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=552.8199999999999s)]

*  The propaganda is appalling. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=568.82s)]
*  So Israel is told, you can defend yourself to a point. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=571.18s)]
*  The Biden administration actually would love if Israel would just stop right now. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=575.92s)]
*  They're going to continue to build up Iran. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=581.8s)]

*  Now Biden is desperately trying to save what he's created. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=593.2s)]
*  He lit a fire in the Middle East. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=598.2s)]
*  And so what is he doing? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=600.28s)]
*  Well, he sends two aircraft carriers that are sitting there. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=601.28s)]
*  What are they doing? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=605.6s)]
*  They're not doing anything. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=606.6s)]
*  Maybe they'll hit a few warehouses. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=607.6s)]
*  But he wants to show, we mean it. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=608.6s)]
*  He sends a nuclear sub. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=611.6s)]
*  Are they going to fire a nuclear missile somewhere? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=613.96s)]
*  What's the nuclear sub? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=616.1600000000001s)]
*  He wants to show he's strong while behind the scenes he's undermining the state of Israel [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=617.24s)]
*  and building up Iran. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=621.8000000000001s)]
*  You want to show you're strong? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=623.96s)]
*  When Iran attacks our bases and does severe damage to our soldiers, you hit strategic [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=625.6800000000001s)]

*  When Iran went after our Navy, went after freighters, Ronald Reagan knocked out half [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=633.9000000000001s)]

*  So Biden's looking for excuses. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=648.6s)]
*  He's looking for people to blame. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=650.24s)]
*  Nobody better than Netanyahu, who is hated by the American left and the New York Times [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=653.4000000000001s)]
*  and our media, who's hated by the radicals that run these parties, these minority parties [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=657.2s)]
*  in Israel, as they try and undermine his government before the war and they're trying to undermine [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=662.2s)]
*  it during the war. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=667.62s)]
*  And these billionaires like Soros and other billionaires, dark money coming in to try [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=669.32s)]
*  and undermine the state of Israel, to try and remove Netanyahu and the government in [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=674.4000000000001s)]
*  the middle of a war. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=679.96s)]
*  He does not want Israel to win any more than he does not want Ukraine to win. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=681.4000000000001s)]
*  You know, I'm not one of these isolationists, but I understand the exasperation with never-ending [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=686.72s)]
*  wars. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=691.72s)]
*  And Biden wants a never-ending war in Ukraine. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=693.1s)]
*  Late with equipment, late with the wrong equipment. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=696.04s)]
*  He's warned them that they cannot use the equipment to actually defeat Russia. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=700.04s)]
*  These people in Ukraine are being chewed up and spit out, and Israel's not going to put [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=704.12s)]
*  up with it. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=708.76s)]
*  They are not going to be chewed up and spit out. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=709.76s)]
*  So he has a failed foreign policy that can be best described as a foreign policy of arson, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=712.24s)]
*  where he sets fires all over the place or others set fires and he won't put them out [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=719.5999999999999s)]
*  in the proper way. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=723.92s)]
*  And so he claims to be concerned about civilians. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=725.9599999999999s)]
*  Unless they're Iranians, he doesn't give a damn. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=728.8399999999999s)]
*  Unless they're in any other part of the Middle East but the Gaza Strip, he doesn't give [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=731.7199999999999s)]
*  a damn. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=734.88s)]
*  He doesn't lecture those countries, those regimes, about civilians and killing your [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=735.88s)]
*  own civilians. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=740.28s)]
*  He doesn't give a damn about our own civilians on the southern border who are dying, tens [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=741.4799999999999s)]
*  of thousands, hundreds of thousands during the course of his administration, because [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=745.76s)]
*  he won't secure the border. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=749.92s)]
*  And so he's now looking for blame. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=752.8199999999999s)]
*  But it's more than that. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=755.36s)]
*  You ever see the movie The Bridge Over the River Kwai? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=756.36s)]
*  It's a great movie. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=758.8000000000001s)]
*  I believe it was 1957, give or take. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=759.92s)]
*  And there's a Lieutenant Colonel Nicholson played by Alec Guinness. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=764.12s)]
*  And trust me, Joe Biden is no Alec Guinness. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=768.04s)]
*  In the bottom line, at the end of the movie, you have a POW camp in Indochina. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=771.64s)]
*  Japanese Empire, Imperial Japan, are brutalizing American Yanks. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=779.92s)]
*  And they have these POW camps where they keep them. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=786.8s)]
*  And so they decide that they're going to use them for slave labor. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=790.4799999999999s)]
*  And they need this bridge over the River Kwai so they can move Japanese troops from one [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=794.0799999999999s)]
*  location to another. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=801.12s)]
*  And Lieutenant Colonel Nicholson, he's basically the commanding officer, the platoon that was [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=804.16s)]
*  captured, or members of the platoon who were in this POW camp. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=808.12s)]
*  And they build this bridge, and it's beautiful. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=812.84s)]
*  They develop the architecture. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=817.08s)]
*  They decide how it's going to be built. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=819.08s)]
*  They complete it. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=821.52s)]
*  They complete it in record time. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=822.64s)]
*  But the order goes out to blow it up. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=825.32s)]
*  Blow it up when a train full of Japanese soldiers are crossing the bridge. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=830.64s)]
*  And there is the plunger for the TNT on the opposite end of the bridge from where the [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=837.4s)]
*  Japanese train is coming. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=844.56s)]
*  And so the order goes out, blow it up. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=847.88s)]
*  Blow it up. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=851.1999999999999s)]
*  And the train's coming. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=852.1999999999999s)]
*  And you won't blow it up. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=854.1999999999999s)]
*  Why? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=857.4s)]
*  He was too proud of the bridge. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=858.4s)]
*  He's too proud of what they have created. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=861.52s)]
*  It didn't matter. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=865.16s)]
*  He wouldn't blow it up. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=867.6999999999999s)]
*  Then at the end, he's shot. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=868.6999999999999s)]
*  And as he's dying, he falls over, hits the plunger, the bridge blows up with a Japanese [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=870.8s)]
*  train. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=874.7199999999999s)]
*  Not a perfect parallel, but good enough. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=878.76s)]
*  That's Joe Biden's foreign policy. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=881.4399999999999s)]
*  He needs to blow it up. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=884.6s)]
*  But he won't blow it up. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=887.12s)]
*  And the enemy keeps crossing his bridge and crossing his bridge. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=889.72s)]
*  He keeps making sure that they have enough money to get across that bridge. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=894.1999999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden is a stubborn and transient individual who is always an arsonist when it comes to [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=897.5799999999999s)]
*  foreign policy. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY1lWSuY_ls&t=904.0999999999999s)]
