# White House: Hamas is unwilling to negotiate on hostages
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is)
*  It sounds like both Israel and Hamas have given up on it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, for right now, neither side is willing to come back to the table. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=3.24s)]
*  And I think it's important to remember, George, how this fell apart. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=7.2s)]
*  It fell apart because Hamas was unwilling and refused to come up with additional lists [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=9.52s)]
*  of women and children, which we know they are holding, and put them on the list so that [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  Israel could evaluate that and we could get them exchanged. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=19.88s)]
*  The White House says there is no timeline for the release of more hostages from Gaza, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=23.04s)]
*  leaving families in the dark about when they will see their loved ones again. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=28.72s)]
*  That includes the Bibas family. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=33.32s)]
*  Hamas claims 10-month-old Kefir, 4-year-old brother Ariel, and their mother Shira were [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=34.6s)]
*  killed in an airstrike but did not provide any evidence. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=40.12s)]
*  Her father, Yarden, also being held hostage. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=43.56s)]
*  Elan Keshet is a cousin of the Bibas family and joins us now. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=47.4s)]
*  Elan, good morning. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=51.68s)]
*  I see you're holding a picture of 10-month-old Kefir there. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=52.68s)]
*  First I want to start with, do you have any new information? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  Have any officials given you any insight of their whereabouts or if they're alive? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=59.32s)]
*  We don't have any additional information about their well-being. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=66.48s)]
*  What we do know is that time is running out and it makes no sense that they are still [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=71.76s)]
*  not being released, that they weren't released as part of their last release, and they must [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=77.0s)]
*  come home. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=81.64s)]
*  They are in real danger to die. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=82.64s)]
*  Elan, you're speaking now on international live television. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=85.67999999999999s)]
*  What would you like to say to Israel's government, to Hamas' captives that are holding this [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=91.36s)]
*  family and also to the White House here in Washington? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  I would like to first say, of course, thank you for having me here. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  And I want to address President Biden and every one of you at home that watches here. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=109.0s)]
*  Please help us save the family and bring them home. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=115.64s)]
*  President Biden, you've shown your ability to influence what's going on and to put pressure [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  where it counts. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=125.28s)]
*  So we really need President Biden and the entire U.S. government to help us here and [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=126.52s)]
*  put international pressure on Hamas to stop them from doing this inhumane evil and torture [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=134.0s)]
*  us every day and bring this little child and his brother and both of his parents home. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=141.67999999999998s)]
*  We can't go on like this. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=151.32s)]
*  It will soon be 60 days. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=153.79999999999998s)]
*  The one thing that's important more than anything is the safe return of the hostages home and [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=157.07999999999998s)]
*  of course, children and mothers even more urgently. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=165.64s)]
*  Ilan, do you feel that Prime Minister Netanyahu is doing enough to bring the hostages home? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=172.11999999999998s)]
*  I don't know if he's doing enough or not, but whether he does it or not, I still wish to [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=182.44s)]
*  ask him and demand and remind that the Israeli citizens are the most important [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=190.84s)]
*  for the Israeli government, of course. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=199.56s)]
*  Of course, you can't keep going with the babies and children to come back home. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=203.96s)]
*  It has been too long already. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=211.0s)]
*  So please, we demand and we beg that every day, the first thing you do is look to fear [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=213.8s)]
*  and everyone else in the eyes and think, how can I get them as fast as I can back home? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=222.28s)]
*  This is the most important thing and this should be the top priority. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=230.04s)]
*  Top priority indeed. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=235.08s)]
*  Ilan Kishad, thank you for joining us. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=236.52s)]
*  Please give us any information if you get new information on their whereabouts. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=238.52s)]
*  Thank you for joining us this morning. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCX1l4514is&t=242.92000000000002s)]
