# IDF spokesperson says Israel expects to bring all hostages home
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4)
*  Let's bring in IDF International spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Kendrickis. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=0.0s)]
*  Colonel, it's good to be with you. See, the big question is, is this extended pause, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=4.48s)]
*  some are calling it a temporary ceasefire, will happen and whether or not the hostages will be [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=9.6s)]
*  released? Here's what President Biden said about it just a short time ago. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=14.8s)]
*  We're now very close, very close. They could bring some of these hostages home very soon, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=19.92s)]
*  but I don't want to get into the details of things because nothing is done until it's done. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=27.28s)]
*  And we have more to say. We will. Things are looking good at the moment. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=32.96s)]
*  A little difficult to understand, but he said nothing is done until it's done. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=38.96s)]
*  Is it your expectation, Colonel, that this will get done? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=42.8s)]
*  Well, hello. Thank you for having me. It is definitely our expectation to get our hostages [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=48.64s)]
*  home. All of them. It's been 46 days when women, children, babies and elderly have been held in [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=54.88s)]
*  Hamas captivity. And of course, any day will be not a moment too soon to get them home. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=61.84s)]
*  There are a lot of details, a lot of moving parts as we speak. What we are doing in the IDF is of [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=69.12s)]
*  course to remain pressure on Hamas to not relent our operational pressure on them and of course, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=75.6s)]
*  execute whatever orders we are given by the Israeli cabinet. And there's many things happening [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=83.84s)]
*  at this time. I won't be able to tell you exactly where we stand and where the hostages are and the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=89.04s)]
*  technical details of it. I'll just say that, of course, it is of paramount importance for us, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=96.16s)]
*  for the IDF, for the state of Israel to get our hostages back. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=101.68s)]
*  Colonel, what we are reporting on right now at this hour from our own reporters, some of the terms [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=104.80000000000001s)]
*  of this deal, that it would be approximately 50 hostages, women and children, four, 150 Palestinian [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=111.36s)]
*  women and children being held by Israel. They're saying this would be a phased release of about 10 [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=118.88s)]
*  hostages followed by a ceasefire if the ceasefire holds, followed by more, I should say, more [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=124.88s)]
*  hostages being released if the ceasefire holds. And that multi-day ceasefire could be up to five [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=133.2s)]
*  days. Can you add any further detail to that reporting right now? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=138.32s)]
*  Yeah, I can add details that any ceasefire with Hamas based on our previous experience [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=144.95999999999998s)]
*  is always a dubious endeavor. We've had soldiers taken hostage or being abducted in 2014 after a [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=150.72s)]
*  UN ceasefire was brokered. So we have to be very careful when it comes to anything that relates to [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=160.0s)]
*  operations on the ground with Hamas. I also know that there are other conditions that Hamas is [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=166.32s)]
*  trying to stipulate what we will do and will not do while the hostages are being returned. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=171.84s)]
*  But I think that, Ballpark, your reporting seems correct. And I think that your viewers are getting [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=177.92s)]
*  a very good understanding of the situation as I understand it as well. But just like the president [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  just before said, we'll have to wait and see. And it's not done until it's done. And based on our [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=190.48s)]
*  experience with Hamas, I can only believe what I see and I can touch with my own hands. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=196.32000000000002s)]
*  Colonel, one of those stipulations as we understand it is that Israel stop surveillance [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=201.84s)]
*  of its drone fleet for six hours every day. We just talked with Michael Oren, the former [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=207.60000000000002s)]
*  Israeli ambassador to the U.S. about that. And he said there can only be one reason why Hamas [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=213.60000000000002s)]
*  wouldn't want the drones flying around. It's so that they can surreptitiously move their assets [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  about, they can regroup, rearm and prepare to take the IDF back on again. For weeks we've been [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=225.04s)]
*  hearing about the dangers both militarily and politically of declaring any kind of ceasefire. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  Why is Israel willing to do this now? Well, I think it's clear that the government, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=239.12s)]
*  you know, the cabinet is voting on it now. The IDF has made its voice heard to the cabinet. But [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=246.39999999999998s)]
*  ultimately these are decisions made by the government and by the war cabinet. Once they [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=252.72s)]
*  will make the decision, then we will execute it. There's always pros and cons. And of course, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=258.16s)]
*  we would rather not be in the situation that we are in with more than 236 Israeli hostages being [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=262.88s)]
*  held. But we have to deal the hand that we've been dealt or play the cards that we have and make the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=269.76s)]
*  best of the situation. Of course, we would rather continue to monitor the situation, continue [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=276.24s)]
*  pressure on Hamas. But if there's a chance of getting hostages back home, reuniting families [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=281.6s)]
*  and getting women, children, elderly people back home into safety in Israel, that is of course of [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=287.52000000000004s)]
*  paramount importance. Nothing says that the war ends after hostages are returned. Hamas needs to [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=293.20000000000005s)]
*  be destroyed and we need to free Gaza of Hamas and free ourselves of these terrorists. That doesn't [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=299.36s)]
*  change. Colonel, can you give us any idea of the condition of these hostages that may be released? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=305.76s)]
*  Yeah, not yet. We will have to see that. You know, we were working on the assumption that [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=315.68s)]
*  all of the hostages that will be returned are live hostages. But again, we're dealing with a [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=320.08s)]
*  very corrupt organization. Hamas is extremely corrupt. They are deceitful and they have a long [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  track record of blatant lying to the world and of course to anybody else. So we will have to see [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=332.24s)]
*  and touch and evaluate with our own hands before we can make any assurances and make any assumptions. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=338.24s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Konrykis, thank you for joining us with the update. We appreciate it, sir. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=345.6s)]
*  Thank you, Colonel. Thank you for having me. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rplm0x-pUJ4&t=349.76s)]
