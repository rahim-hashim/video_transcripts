# House members visibly shaken, 'gutted' after seeing 10/7 footage
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA)
*  Right now, the Israeli military is facing bloody street fights with Hamas terrorists. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel released some new video of soldiers taking control of an outpost in Gaza. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=6.08s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=10.84s)]
*  And the IDF is going room to room now inside Gaza's largest hospital. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=18.3s)]
*  They say they're finding weapons and military gear there, and they're searching for any [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  information on the some 240 hostages. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=29.24s)]
*  Hamas terrorists took those people during the October 7th attack on Israel. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=34.239999999999995s)]
*  I'm Harris Faulkner. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=39.32s)]
*  You are in the Faulkner Focus. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=40.76s)]
*  Israel says this is a targeted operation to protect the patients inside that huge hospital, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=42.839999999999996s)]
*  yet go after Hamas leadership. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=50.44s)]
*  And a flip here by the Biden administration. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=53.959999999999994s)]
*  Remember, for days now, they've been criticizing Israel over that hospital operation. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=56.6s)]
*  And then now a change. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=61.84s)]
*  The Pentagon has confirmed what the Israelis showed the world yesterday. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=63.28s)]
*  The terrorists are, in fact, operating inside hospitals. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=68.58s)]
*  National Security spokesman John Kirby here. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=73.12s)]
*  I can confirm for you that we have information that Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=76.0s)]
*  use some hospitals in the Gaza Strip, including Al-Shifa and tunnels underneath them to conceal [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  and to support their military operations and to hold hostages. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=91.2s)]
*  They have stored weapons there and they're prepared to respond to an Israeli military [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  operation against that facility. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=98.56s)]
*  And on Capitol Hill, members of the House visibly shaken after they watched footage [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=100.88s)]
*  of Hamas's October 7th atrocities. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=104.68s)]
*  Many of those terrorists were body cameras. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=107.72s)]
*  As you know, they were GoPro in it as they were slaughtering men, women and children, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=109.88s)]
*  entire families, one in front of each one of them and then killing the last one. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=114.8s)]
*  It's torture. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=120.72s)]
*  Senators are planning a wider viewing tomorrow in their chamber. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  These horrific images of atrocities are etched into my memory forever. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=129.24s)]
*  You could have heard a pin drop except for the sighs and the cries in the room because [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=133.76s)]
*  the video would make anyone with a soul cry. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=138.04s)]
*  Horrific scenes that I can't get into detail about because they're so disgusting. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=142.84s)]
*  They are a messianic cult. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  They are a terror organization. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=151.32s)]
*  The devil. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=154.92s)]
*  That's what they are. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=156.04s)]
*  Incarnate. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=157.04s)]
*  Michigan Democrat Haley Stevens posted, I'm gutted. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=158.76s)]
*  This is barbarism and attack on all humanity. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=162.88s)]
*  California Republican Darrell Issa said, watching the footage made me sick to my stomach. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=166.35999999999999s)]
*  Heartbreaking and dramatic newly released video from October 7th shows the bravery of [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=172.35999999999999s)]
*  a young off-duty soldier. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=178.0s)]
*  He was defending civilians who were huddled inside a rocket shelter as the terrorists [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=180.51999999999998s)]
*  tossed in grenades. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  The soldier lobbing them right back before they would explode one after another after [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=186.84s)]
*  another. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=192.95999999999998s)]
*  Seven times he did that before he himself was killed by the eighth grenade. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=194.56s)]
*  His actions saved lives, especially those seven people inside. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=200.84s)]
*  But even further than that, because while that was going on, obviously, some were maybe [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=207.72s)]
*  able to get away. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=213.68s)]
*  Alex Hogan is in northern Israel where the IDF has launched counterattacks on the border [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=216.16s)]
*  with Lebanon. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=221.56s)]
*  First of all, that point of bravery by that young man. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=222.56s)]
*  Just an angel on earth. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=227.28s)]
*  Harris, there have been so many stories of people who tried to shield others on October [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=229.28s)]
*  7th and lost their own life as a result of that. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=236.08s)]
*  So many stories of bravery. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=239.08s)]
*  There are still thousands of people who are recovering from those injuries, but there [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=240.08s)]
*  is also a completely separate conflict playing out here in Israel right now that is on the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=243.92000000000002s)]
*  of Lebanon where we are in the north. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=250.04s)]
*  Sirens just went off. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=251.92s)]
*  We're hearing reports of a potential foreign drone in the air. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=253.07999999999998s)]
*  There is also the sound of machine guns and artillery fire on the border between Israel [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=256.92s)]
*  and Lebanon. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=262.2s)]
*  It was earlier today when Hezbollah fired a range of attacks on the hillside behind [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=263.2s)]
*  us. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=267.48s)]
*  Most of these little villages are evacuated, but this is what it looks like when you hear [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=268.48s)]
*  the sound of an incoming attack. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=272.08s)]
*  So right now on the screen we're able to watch the skyline, all of the explosions taking [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=274.84s)]
*  place. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=299.35999999999996s)]
*  This is the smoke just outside from where we've been different from the other ones. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=300.35999999999996s)]
*  We can hear the loud booms of artillery overhead. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=305.44s)]
*  That major conflict here, we're hearing more sound of artillery right now, but this is [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=320.64s)]
*  in the south in Gaza where the IDF is inside the Al-Shifa hospital releasing these images. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=325.12s)]
*  So far, soldiers have uncovered ammunition and other military infrastructure. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=332.0s)]
*  It has been days of standoff outside of this hospital before today to prevent more civilian [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=335.8s)]
*  casualties. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=341.6s)]
*  Israel's defense says that it's taken control of the north and that it's also uncovered [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=342.6s)]
*  Hamas training center with tunnels, even a classroom and dozens of weapons. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=347.68s)]
*  But as far as the concerns for civilians who were caught in all of this, Israel has now [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=353.04s)]
*  green lighted the shipment to Gaza for humanitarian reasons of fuel. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=357.68s)]
*  This is the first fuel truck to drive through the Rafa crossing in this footage right here. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=362.24s)]
*  Israel had previously not allowed fuel shipments saying that Hamas would only use that fuel [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=367.04s)]
*  to fight back. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=372.0s)]
*  There is some criticism from local officials here who argue that that is simply enabling [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=373.0s)]
*  Hamas and basically using it as a weapon. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=377.56s)]
*  So again, the focus here is today is on the Al-Shifa hospital where we're just learning [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=379.96000000000004s)]
*  more details about the dozens of premature babies in the hospital. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=384.32s)]
*  They've reportedly been moved to a certain part of the hospital that does have electricity. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=388.44s)]
*  Harris. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=393.68s)]
*  Thank you very much for that update. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE69ti5XEaA&t=394.68s)]
