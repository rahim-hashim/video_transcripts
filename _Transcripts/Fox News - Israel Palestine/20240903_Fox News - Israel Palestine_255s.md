# Hamas chief Sinwar reportedly surrounded by hostages in Gaza tunnel
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [September 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg)
*  An innocent hostages shot execution style by Hamas terrorists. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=0.0s)]
*  It's igniting fury across Israel and in America. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=4.4s)]
*  And there are fresh calls to get a hostage deal done now. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=7.86s)]
*  But is that even possible? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=10.5s)]
*  Let's go to Trey Yanks. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=11.74s)]
*  He is there in Israel. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=13.540000000000001s)]
*  He has an update for us and he's going to stick around for a couple questions. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=14.540000000000001s)]
*  Hi Trey. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=17.580000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, hey Dana. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=18.580000000000002s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=20.78s)]
*  We do expect more protests here in Israel in the coming days as the country braces for [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=21.78s)]
*  what comes next in this conflict. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=26.5s)]
*  Remember the war started 333 days ago on the morning of October 7th when Hamas launched [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=28.5s)]
*  this broad attack into southern Israel, dragging more than 240 people hostage back into the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=34.74s)]
*  strip. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=41.06s)]
*  There are still more than 100 people there. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=42.06s)]
*  Some of them are dead, some alive. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=43.5s)]
*  And the demonstrators who have been in the streets of Tel Aviv and other major population [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=45.74s)]
*  centers say they will continue to protest until the government reaches an agreement [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=49.42s)]
*  with Hamas. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=54.620000000000005s)]
*  But remember, they're not negotiating directly. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=55.620000000000005s)]
*  These conversations have taken place in Cairo, Egypt, in Doha, Qatar and in other locations [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=58.08s)]
*  with the Americans involved in the process. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=63.36s)]
*  But still there are key disagreements between the two sides about how they could actually [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=65.78s)]
*  end this conflict, bring the hostages out of Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=70.88s)]
*  But I can tell you, we were in the streets of Tel Aviv the other night. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=76.28s)]
*  This is a city of around 300,000 people and about a quarter million were in the streets. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=79.0s)]
*  Some came here from other parts of Israel. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=84.28s)]
*  And they were demanding that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reach an agreement. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=86.44s)]
*  And we spoke with one father and he really stood out amid the crowd. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  And you could see the sadness in his eyes. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=94.48s)]
*  And on his shirt, he had a photo of his son who is still being held inside Gaza. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=96.2s)]
*  He's believed to be alive. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=101.44s)]
*  And he said, time is running out. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=102.88s)]
*  If they don't find a solution, my son will come back in a body bag. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=104.74s)]
*  This is very personal for the Israeli people and the entire world is watching and waiting [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=108.46s)]
*  to see what comes next. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=112.92s)]
*  Dana? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=114.24s)]
*  Hamas' requirements is that Sinwar, the mastermind of this whole thing, of October 7th, be kept [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=115.24s)]
*  alive. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=121.24s)]
*  I mean, how can Netanyahu agree to something like that? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=122.24s)]
*  Well, look, it's a broadly ludicrous ask by Hamas because we're talking about one of the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=126.16s)]
*  masterminds behind the October 7th massacre. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=132.95999999999998s)]
*  Remember, there were three people who planned this event, the deadliest day in Israel's [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=135.4s)]
*  history, the largest slaughter of Jews since the Holocaust. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=140.32s)]
*  We're talking about Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Def and Ismael Kania. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=143.84s)]
*  Mohammed Def and Ismael Kania both were killed in recent months. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=147.60000000000002s)]
*  Def in an airstrike in Gaza and an explosion in Tehran, the capital of Iran, took out Kania. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=151.28s)]
*  So Sinwar is the only one left. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=157.76000000000002s)]
*  And according to reports, he is surrounded by hostages in the tunnels beneath Gaza. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  So Hamas is trying to keep him alive. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=164.88000000000002s)]
*  But certainly he is the number one target for the Israeli military. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=167.16000000000003s)]
*  We understand that, but we also understand the complexities of the battlefield. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=170.2s)]
*  The Israelis are still striking Hamas positions inside Gaza, but with hostages being held [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  by the organization and this new threat overnight by Abel Abayda, the top military spokesman [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=179.64s)]
*  for Hamas, there is concern that as Israeli forces push deeper into these last Hamas strongholds, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=185.32s)]
*  that more hostages could be executed. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=191.51999999999998s)]
*  An incredibly complicated situation for the Israelis. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=193.92s)]
*  And it's part of the reason that you are seeing not just political pressure, but increased [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=196.84s)]
*  military pressure today to find a solution. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=200.4s)]
*  Awful stuff. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=202.72s)]
*  Trey, just about 30 seconds left. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=203.72s)]
*  We saw the protests against Benjamin Netanyahu and the calls for a ceasefire. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=205.48000000000002s)]
*  Are there protests against Hamas too? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=209.68s)]
*  I mean, after all, those were bullets from Hamas that killed the six several days ago. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=211.68s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=218.24s)]
*  These demonstrators have taken out a lot of their frustration on the prime minister, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  but they're also calling for the release of these hostages from Hamas captivity. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=224.56s)]
*  This is an event and something that has really shaken the entire country to its core. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=229.2s)]
*  And they attended funerals when they were hoping to be attending the release of these [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=235.18s)]
*  hostages. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=239.12s)]
*  Guys, back to you. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=240.12s)]
*  Trey Yanks, thank you. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3L7J-aimrg&t=241.12s)]
