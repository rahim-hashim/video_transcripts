# Israeli ambassador to the UN: We hope there will be a diplomatic solution
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [September 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU)
*  All right, Israel today launching new strikes in southern Lebanon as Hezbollah vows revenge [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=0.0s)]
*  for those pager and walkie-talkie attacks. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=4.72s)]
*  All of this as the UN General Assembly backs a resolution demanding Israel end its unlawful [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  presence in Gaza and the West Bank. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  Joining us now to react is Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Denon. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  Ambassador, always good to talk with you. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  Thank you for having me, Sandra. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=20.88s)]
*  First off, your reaction to these new strikes in southern Lebanon and where this is going [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=21.88s)]
*  next. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=25.84s)]
*  You know, we are not commenting on what happened in Lebanon in the last few days, but I will [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=26.96s)]
*  tell you that we will bring back the Israelis who live in northern part of Israel to their [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=31.6s)]
*  homes for 11 months that are displaced. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=36.4s)]
*  So we are trying diplomacy. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=39.4s)]
*  We are very patient, but the point that we have to say enough is enough. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=40.4s)]
*  So either diplomatically we will push Hezbollah off the fence or we will use our abilities [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=45.6s)]
*  and we have abilities, our might in order to push them from the fence. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=51.28s)]
*  On the latest round of these attacks now, walkie-talkies, pagers first. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=55.76s)]
*  This is the second wave of these attacks. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=59.64s)]
*  Hezbollah vowing revenge. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  Where does all this go and what is this new warfare? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=64.06s)]
*  Well, you know, one should ask himself why we have a war with Hezbollah. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=66.44s)]
*  It all started on October 8th. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=70.96s)]
*  After October 7th, Hezbollah decided to show sympathy to the attack of Hamas and to attack [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=73.56s)]
*  Israel. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=78.8s)]
*  And since that day, they launched thousands of rockets and missiles into Israel and we [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=79.8s)]
*  are pushing back, but we haven't used all of our capabilities. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=84.56s)]
*  But I think now when we're getting to a year from October 7, the Israeli public, the Israeli [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=88.46000000000001s)]
*  government decided to add another goal to the goals of the war, is to allow the people [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  of the north to go back home. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=98.14s)]
*  And in order to do that, we will have to mobilize our strengths, stretch our muscles and push [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=99.36s)]
*  them back. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=104.6s)]
*  We heard that from Israel officials overnight that we are not using the fullest of our capabilities, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=105.6s)]
*  that we have more to come. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=110.36s)]
*  What is the decision-making process, knowing how things are escalating right now? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  How do you deploy those resources and in what time? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=117.18s)]
*  Well, we still hope that there will be a diplomatic solution. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=119.76s)]
*  There are a few negotiators trying to negotiate a deal and they're telling both sides, even [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=122.64s)]
*  if you go to a war, at the end of the war you're going to have to come, sit down and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=127.2s)]
*  come to some kind of an agreement. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=131.16s)]
*  So let's do it before the war. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=132.84s)]
*  But you know, when you look at Hezbollah, you understand they are not deciding. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=135.28s)]
*  Iran is behind the proxies. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=139.12s)]
*  The ayatollahs are actually sending the proxies to fight with us. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=141.16s)]
*  So it's not for them to decide. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=144.84s)]
*  And I'm not optimistic about that. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=146.28s)]
*  I think, unfortunately, we will have no choice but to push them with our might from the border. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  Incredible strength on the part of the Israeli people and on the part of the Israeli military. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=154.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, an Israeli man was arrested over an alleged Iranian plot to assassinate Prime [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=157.6s)]
*  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  Obviously, this is amid all of these growing tensions, Ambassador. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=167.04000000000002s)]
*  How big of a threat is this and what is the reaction on the part of Israel to this? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=170.96s)]
*  The Iranians are meddling not only in the U.S. politics but also in Israel. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=175.52s)]
*  They are recruiting people online. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=179.8s)]
*  They offer them a lot of money in order to create chaos in Israel. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=182.16000000000003s)]
*  Unfortunately, we cannot go into the details, but this individual got involved. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=186.20000000000002s)]
*  He actually flew to Tehran. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=190.16000000000003s)]
*  I don't know if he was paid or not, but they are doing a lot of damages trying to infiltrate [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=192.2s)]
*  both here in the U.S. and in Israel with their money. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=198.32s)]
*  We have to push back against Iran. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=201.95999999999998s)]
*  Now we are pushing back the proxies, Hamas, Hezbollah, but at the end of the day, we, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=203.79999999999998s)]
*  the democracies of the world, will have to go and deal with the main threat, which is [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  Iran. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=213.44s)]
*  Throwing one other thing into the mix here amid these escalating tensions is the Iranian [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=214.44s)]
*  meddling in U.S. elections. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=219.88s)]
*  And the United States' response to it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=221.64s)]
*  So how would you generalize the United States' response right now, obviously, as we work [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=223.96s)]
*  our way to a presidential election just weeks away now, and how we are responding to the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=228.44s)]
*  growing threat that is Iran? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=235.24s)]
*  Well, I'm sure you have the capabilities, but you have to be aware that the Iranians [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=236.88s)]
*  ignore protocol. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=241.44s)]
*  They ignore diplomacy. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=242.94s)]
*  They will be more involved than you can imagine. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=244.51999999999998s)]
*  We see it in Israel. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=246.5s)]
*  We have seen cyberattacks in the last 24 hours. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=247.76s)]
*  They were actually texting millions of Israelis, false messages, trying to scare them about [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=250.86s)]
*  attack coming from Lebanon. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=257.46000000000004s)]
*  They will do the same here. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=259.26s)]
*  You have to be prepared for that. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=260.26s)]
*  What we're hearing coming out of the United Nations, I know that you have a message to [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=262.82s)]
*  our viewers about what we are hearing there, the unlawful presence that is Israel in Gaza. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=266.90000000000003s)]
*  Your response? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=273.34000000000003s)]
*  Well, it's a circus. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=274.34000000000003s)]
*  Yesterday, they passed a resolution condemning Israel, trying to isolate us. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=275.34000000000003s)]
*  This week, there will be a lot of traffic because all the leaders will come to New York [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=279.82s)]
*  City, but there will be no resolution condemning Hamas. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=282.7s)]
*  That bothers us. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=286.86s)]
*  You know, after what we experienced on October 7, the UN is not capable of condemning the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=287.86s)]
*  atrocities. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=292.65999999999997s)]
*  They are not capable of actually saying Hamas, but what they did yesterday was condemning [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=293.65999999999997s)]
*  Israel. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=298.46s)]
*  It's shameful. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=299.46s)]
*  Ambassador, we always appreciate when you can join us. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=300.46s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=302.5s)]
*  Thank you, Sandra. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=303.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=304.5s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--1KOPO-MWU&t=305.5s)]
