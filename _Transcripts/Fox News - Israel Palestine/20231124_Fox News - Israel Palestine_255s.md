# Sirens in Israel warn of possible aerial attack from Yemen
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M)
*  Breaking news, just moments ago, sirens sounding in Israel's Red Sea region warning of a potential [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=0.0s)]
*  aerial attack from Yemen. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=6.3s)]
*  That comes just hours into the temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, which took effect [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=8.36s)]
*  overnight. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=12.86s)]
*  Thirteen civilian hostages expected to be freed by Hamas this morning around 9 a.m. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=13.86s)]
*  Eastern time, the first of 50 over the next four days. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=18.26s)]
*  Three American citizens, though, not expected to be released today. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=21.94s)]
*  Israeli officials say the families of the hostages have all been notified. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=25.26s)]
*  Here at home, pro-Palestinian protesters temporarily halting the Macy's Thanksgiving [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=29.38s)]
*  Day Parade. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=34.1s)]
*  The New York Post calling them bloody idiots. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=35.28s)]
*  Beverly Hallberg is president of the district media group, and she joins me now. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=37.38s)]
*  Beverly, I don't want to give these idiots more of a platform after they disrupted a [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=60.980000000000004s)]
*  parade for children. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=64.7s)]
*  I'm going to focus on Joe Biden. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=66.14s)]
*  The old adage goes, doesn't it? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=68.02s)]
*  If you try to please everybody, you please no one. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=69.86s)]
*  Wouldn't his approval with regard to how he's handling the Israeli crisis be better if he [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=72.26s)]
*  just unequivocally threw support behind Israel instead of trying to meekly placate the other [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=77.62s)]
*  side? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=82.98s)]
*  I never thought I would say this, but I think our president should take a page from Senator [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=83.98s)]
*  John Fetterman, who has without any type of apology shown his support of Israel raising [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=89.4s)]
*  the Israel flag to people as he passes them. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=95.78s)]
*  Look, with Joe Biden, what he's constantly doing is reading the polls and seeing whether [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=98.5s)]
*  or not his position is going to impact him. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=102.94s)]
*  I think the way a lot of Democrats are looking at this, though, middle of the road, Democrats [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=106.06s)]
*  agree with him. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=109.66s)]
*  It's young people, it's progressives that don't like his stance. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=110.66s)]
*  But I think his campaign is looking at this as, look, if the campaign was two weeks away, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=113.74s)]
*  it would be a problem, but we have 11 months. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=117.89999999999999s)]
*  This is going to be a long game for them. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=120.58s)]
*  But I think it's a shame that the president isn't just sticking to a firm, firm position, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=122.58000000000001s)]
*  instead is reading the polls a little bit too much. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=127.42s)]
*  OK, but how does Biden win back those? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=129.58s)]
*  I'm going to call him two groups, the Jewish Democrat, who's always reliably voted Democrat, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=131.66s)]
*  and what I'm going to call the Michigan Muslim, who's not happy with how he's handled. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=136.56s)]
*  How does he win those voters back? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=139.9s)]
*  And if he doesn't, where do those votes go? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=142.66s)]
*  Well, I think he's hoping that Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee, and he's [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=144.94s)]
*  hoping that people in those camps, the progressives, that they would never vote for Donald Trump [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=150.5s)]
*  and not only never vote, but would definitely come out and vote for whoever is running against [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=155.14000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=159.9s)]
*  So I think he's pushing for Trump to be the nominee, Republican nominee. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=160.94s)]
*  Of course, all polling is showing that that is the most likely scenario. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=164.26s)]
*  And he's hoping that the long game is going to help him out. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=167.54000000000002s)]
*  But I think the Michigan battle is the most important. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=169.98000000000002s)]
*  He is looking at where his support is in that toss-up state. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=172.94s)]
*  And so that's what goes back to worrying that this president is going to be making policy [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=177.57999999999998s)]
*  decisions on whether or not he can be elected, not looking at whether or not this is in the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=182.14s)]
*  best interest of the United States and its allies. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=187.18s)]
*  Finally, the Joe Biden campaign releasing a guide to deal with, quote, crazy MAGA nonsense. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=189.89999999999998s)]
*  This first one is a doozy. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=195.38s)]
*  The crazy MAGA guide, you have to do these things. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=196.98s)]
*  Say Trump had the worst job record of any president since the Great Depression. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=199.62s)]
*  Inflation is at a new low. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=202.94s)]
*  President Biden has created nearly 14 jobs. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=204.95999999999998s)]
*  Putting aside the fact that if you did raise this at Thanksgiving, you are a psychopath. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=207.3s)]
*  20 seconds to you, Beverly. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=211.02s)]
*  These are just plain lies. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=212.82000000000002s)]
*  They are lies, and it's told to you by the people who I think are the worst communicators [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=216.10000000000002s)]
*  in the U.S. presidency that we've ever seen. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=220.34s)]
*  And by the way, he was talking about how turkey is cheaper this year, eggs is cheaper this, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=222.46s)]
*  eggs are cheaper this year. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=227.58s)]
*  But guess what? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=228.74s)]
*  He was the president last year. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=229.74s)]
*  He's always saying that it's not as bad as last year. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=231.22000000000003s)]
*  So these are not the owns that they think they are. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=233.38000000000002s)]
*  And I don't think we should be taking communication tips from Biden or Harris. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=235.92s)]
*  It's like the arsonist who burns down a house and says, look, I saved the door. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=238.88s)]
*  Doesn't work that way. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=241.95999999999998s)]
*  Beverly Holberg, happy Thanksgiving. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=242.95999999999998s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPqhyuks_M&t=245.01999999999998s)]
