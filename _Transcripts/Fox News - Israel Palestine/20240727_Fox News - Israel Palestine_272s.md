# ‘DISRESPECTFUL’: Trump slams Kamala Harris’ remarks about Israel
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [July 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo)
*  former President Trump meeting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=0.0s)]
*  with Israeli Prime Minister [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=1.7s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=2.74s)]
*  Netanyahu says he hopes that [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=5.4s)]
*  Israel is getting close to a deal [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=7.1000000000000005s)]
*  to bring the hostages home. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=9.78s)]
*  He met with President Biden [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=11.44s)]
*  and Vice President Harris [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=12.72s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=13.82s)]
*  Harris said that they have [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=14.780000000000001s)]
*  an unwavering commitment [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=16.18s)]
*  to Israel and to its security, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=17.42s)]
*  but also called what's happening [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=19.12s)]
*  in Gaza devastating. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=20.32s)]
*  Some of her comments angered, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=21.92s)]
*  some in the Netanyahu camp. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=23.56s)]
*  Here's the reaction on that [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=25.42s)]
*  from President Trump. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=27.32s)]
*  I think her remarks were [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=29.66s)]
*  disrespectful. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=31.96s)]
*  They weren't very nice, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=33.28s)]
*  pertaining to Israel. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=35.32s)]
*  I actually don't know how a person [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=36.92s)]
*  who's Jewish can vote for her, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=38.42s)]
*  but that's up to them. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  But she was certainly disrespectful [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=42.32s)]
*  to Israel, in my opinion. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=44.0s)]
*  Okay, with that, we bring in [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=46.34s)]
*  Ari Fleischer, former White House [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=47.46s)]
*  press secretary for President [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  George W. Bush and a Fox News [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=49.94s)]
*  contributor. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=51.88s)]
*  Ari, always good to have you [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=52.38s)]
*  with us. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=53.44s)]
*  What's your reaction to the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=54.6s)]
*  comments? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=56.28s)]
*  This is obviously one of the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=56.94s)]
*  first kind of crack-set [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=58.18s)]
*  foreign policy for her as nominee. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=60.78s)]
*  How do you think that went, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=63.84s)]
*  and what do you think about [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=64.78s)]
*  President Trump's comments? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=65.44s)]
*  Well, I wish that the Biden- [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=68.12s)]
*  Harris administration had [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=70.18s)]
*  an unwavering commitment [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=71.38s)]
*  to Israel. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=72.42s)]
*  I fear they have an unwavering [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=73.36s)]
*  commitment to winning [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=75.16s)]
*  the state of Michigan. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=76.26s)]
*  Kamala Harris's only goal here [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  is to create space, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=81.36s)]
*  to create distance between [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=82.4s)]
*  herself and Israel, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=84.03999999999999s)]
*  to send a signal. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=85.34s)]
*  When she says to those who [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=86.4s)]
*  think that Israel has used [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=88.4s)]
*  too many attacks, that Israel [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=90.06s)]
*  has been too aggressive, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=91.8s)]
*  I hear you, I see you. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=93.3s)]
*  She is speaking to the Arab [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=95.14s)]
*  community of Michigan. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=96.54s)]
*  She is speaking to the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=97.68s)]
*  progressive community across [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=99.34s)]
*  the United States of America. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=100.78s)]
*  That's where she focused her [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=102.44s)]
*  remarks. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=103.88s)]
*  That's because of politics. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=104.62s)]
*  What she should have said is [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=106.88s)]
*  the United States supports the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=108.22s)]
*  destruction of Hamas. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=109.62s)]
*  We don't want any future [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=111.88s)]
*  hostages to be taken. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=113.36s)]
*  And until Israel is able to [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  destroy Hamas, that has to [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=116.32s)]
*  come first because there will [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=119.02s)]
*  be no peace if Hamas is back [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=120.96s)]
*  in power. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=123.06s)]
*  Here's a piece of what she [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=123.86s)]
*  said on Thursday so people [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=125.36s)]
*  can see it for themselves. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=127.25999999999999s)]
*  Let's watch. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=128.3s)]
*  I've had an unwavering [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=130.2s)]
*  commitment to the existence [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=131.6s)]
*  of the state of Israel, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=133.48s)]
*  to its security, and to the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  people of Israel. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=137.07999999999998s)]
*  What has happened in Gaza [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=138.18s)]
*  over the past nine months [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=139.94s)]
*  is devastating. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=141.44s)]
*  As I just told Prime Minister [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=142.48s)]
*  Netanyahu, it is time to get [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=143.76s)]
*  this deal done. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=145.88000000000002s)]
*  So, strong language there. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  There were people in the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=149.28s)]
*  Netanyahu group who said that [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=150.42000000000002s)]
*  she was not as forceful behind [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=151.72000000000003s)]
*  closed doors as she was in [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=154.82000000000002s)]
*  public. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=155.86s)]
*  She said that that's absolutely [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=156.76000000000002s)]
*  not what happened, her team [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=158.22000000000003s)]
*  said, that the comments were [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  consistent. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=160.9s)]
*  The Israeli prime minister, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=162.14000000000001s)]
*  the minister, excuse me, of [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=163.46s)]
*  national security, Ben Gavir, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=164.60000000000002s)]
*  said, quote, on Axe, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=166.5s)]
*  there will be no truce, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=168.34s)]
*  Madam candidate. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=170.44000000000003s)]
*  How is this relationship, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=173.14000000000001s)]
*  and how does it affect [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=174.5s)]
*  U.S. national security? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=177.0s)]
*  Well, I think U.S. national [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=180.64s)]
*  security is immediately tied [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=181.64s)]
*  to what is happening with [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=183.14s)]
*  Iran and, therefore, what is [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  happening with Hamas and [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=185.28s)]
*  Hezbollah. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=186.32s)]
*  And under the Biden-Harris [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=187.32s)]
*  administration, they [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=188.62s)]
*  immediately gave Iran access [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=189.88s)]
*  to the oil markets, to tens of [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=192.57999999999998s)]
*  billions of dollars that [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=194.17999999999998s)]
*  President Trump had frozen, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=195.16s)]
*  which limited Iran's ability [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=196.76s)]
*  to fund Hamas, to fund [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=198.42s)]
*  Hezbollah. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=199.79999999999998s)]
*  What did Hamas do with that [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=200.85999999999999s)]
*  money? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=202.06s)]
*  They attacked Israel, and [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=202.79999999999998s)]
*  hence this is where we are [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=204.08s)]
*  now with the war in Gaza. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=205.56s)]
*  But none of this will end, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=207.32s)]
*  Martha. There will be no peace [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=208.56s)]
*  if Hamas continues to exist. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=210.16s)]
*  Israel, Donald Trump was [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=212.6s)]
*  right when Israel, he said, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=214.32s)]
*  Israel needs to finish the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=215.36s)]
*  job. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=216.3s)]
*  And what that means is to put [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=217.1s)]
*  an end to Hamas. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=218.94s)]
*  If you're going to have peace, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=219.94s)]
*  if you're going to give the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=221.3s)]
*  people of Gaza a chance to [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=221.98s)]
*  have free lives, independent [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=223.4s)]
*  lives, proud, successful [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fachOd-3aTo&t=225.38s)]
