# Ben Domenech: Biden doesn't care about Israel or its interests
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [March 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU)
*  Welcome back, America. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=0.0s)]
*  One of my favorite people, Ben Dominic, is with me. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=1.4000000000000001s)]
*  Ben, this administration is funded around. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=4.94s)]
*  It's funding Hamas. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=8.540000000000001s)]
*  It's funding Hezbollah. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=9.6s)]
*  It's funding the Houthis. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=10.74s)]
*  Hundreds of billions of dollars in oil. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=12.780000000000001s)]
*  Iran has attacked us. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=15.88s)]
*  No effective response to them. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  The Houthis are now saying, if you want to come [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=18.78s)]
*  through the Red Sea, you've got to get a license from us. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=20.56s)]
*  Iran is really weeks, if not months, away from getting [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=24.96s)]
*  a nuclear weapon, and they are trashing the hell out of the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=28.22s)]
*  state of Israel. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=30.58s)]
*  Your father-in-law, John McCain, went to the Senate [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=31.419999999999998s)]
*  floor, and he said, for a half hour, I don't come here [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=33.72s)]
*  lightly. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=38.1s)]
*  I don't criticize appointees of another president, especially [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=38.56s)]
*  Obama, who defeated me. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=41.8s)]
*  But this man Blinken is dangerous, and he's going to [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=43.86s)]
*  get people killed. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=46.64s)]
*  And that's when he was up for Deputy Secretary of State. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=47.86s)]
*  What do you respond to this? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=50.980000000000004s)]
*  Well, I think that he's obviously been proven correct, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=52.44s)]
*  everything that the senator said at the time has been shown to [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=55.260000000000005s)]
*  be true about Anthony Blinken. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=59.160000000000004s)]
*  And look, we say a lot of the time that we've got kind of the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=61.36s)]
*  JV team from the Obama era running the show now when it [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=65.74000000000001s)]
*  comes to foreign policy, national security, and defense. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=70.14s)]
*  And I think that this is just proof positive to that. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=73.68s)]
*  We have seen this administration respond so [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=76.78s)]
*  inadequately to our enemies around the world, the enemies of [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=80.66s)]
*  our allies in ways that have absolutely allowed them to run [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=84.24s)]
*  roughshod over our interests and embolden them. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=88.53999999999999s)]
*  They don't really want to go around and actually follow any [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=92.72s)]
*  of the lessons that we've learned over the decades about [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=96.02s)]
*  the importance of deterrence, the importance of showing [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=99.82s)]
*  strength and not letting our enemies get away with things. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=102.36s)]
*  Instead, they just wag their fingers and say, well, you know, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=105.86s)]
*  you've done it again. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=110.1s)]
*  Don't do it again. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  And of course, that just emboldens our enemies more and [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=112.46s)]
*  more. It creates more risks for our allies and it undermines [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=115.6s)]
*  them in critical ways when America needs to be backing them [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=119.64s)]
*  up, needs to be standing strongly with them and behind [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=123.34s)]
*  them. And that's it's a total indictment of this [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=127.58s)]
*  administration. And I think it's you know, it starts at the top. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=130.32s)]
*  It starts with President Biden and it works all its way down [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=133.38s)]
*  from there. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=137.06s)]
*  Says he's going to build a temporary port to get food to [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=138.06s)]
*  Gaza because apparently one of the drops killed five [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=140.94s)]
*  Palestinians literally landed on their heads. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=143.73999999999998s)]
*  You have a man of utter and complete incompetence and [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=147.48s)]
*  stubbornness. He looks at the state of Israel that is fighting [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  like hell with Hezbollah and Hamas, funded all by Iran. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=154.17999999999998s)]
*  They're surrounded. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=158.39999999999998s)]
*  He doesn't put pressure on Iran. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=159.95999999999998s)]
*  He doesn't even put pressure on Hamas. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=162.45999999999998s)]
*  He's got Israel under criminal investigation for possible war [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=164.7s)]
*  crimes. He's issuing executive orders against their citizens [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=168.36s)]
*  today in Samaria. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=171.26s)]
*  He is literally character assassinating Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=173.06s)]
*  publicly. And he said when he came off the floor after a [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=177.36s)]
*  speech, it's now reported that he said to a few Democrat [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=179.94s)]
*  senators, Bibi and I are going to have a come to Jesus moment. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  Don't tell anybody. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=187.14000000000001s)]
*  What is the problem with this man? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=189.34s)]
*  He really does despise the state of Israel. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=191.24s)]
*  That's my contention. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=194.18s)]
*  You know, I think you're absolutely right. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  And in fact, you know, in Franklin Foer's book that looks [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=197.66s)]
*  back at previous interactions between Benjamin Netanyahu and [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=200.62s)]
*  Joe Biden, the way that he talks about him and the way that he [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=204.82s)]
*  attempts to manipulate him, it's just an absolute insult to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=209.06s)]
*  America's greatest ally in the Middle East. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=213.8s)]
*  And I think it's something that, you know, when you look at the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=216.18s)]
*  perspective that the president has on Israel, everything is [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=219.68s)]
*  just there, an irritant that needs to be bent to his will. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=223.57999999999998s)]
*  He's he undermines their interests every which way. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=227.44s)]
*  And he sees them now, I think, as a domestic political problem. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=231.54s)]
*  You saw the images of the Gaza protesters who were in the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=235.98s)]
*  streets trying to block the motorcade to the state of the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=240.61999999999998s)]
*  union. And I really do feel that this White House is more [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=244.2s)]
*  concerned about their progressive left flank than they [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=248.5s)]
*  are about America's ally, Israel. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=252.2s)]
*  They are more concerned with the 100,000 protest votes that you [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=254.28s)]
*  saw in Michigan with the vote, the uncommitted vote in [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=258.18s)]
*  Minnesota and the like going into this election than they are [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=262.32s)]
*  about the continued existence of the state of Israel and their [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=266.28s)]
*  need to protect themselves from these terrorist villains. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=270.2s)]
*  And that is just an absolute indictment of their priorities. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=274.0s)]
*  And here's the thing. First of all, those progressives, they [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=277.06s)]
*  will end up voting for them, just like AOC will still end up [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=279.8s)]
*  voting for him. You know, just like, you know, Rashida Tlaib and [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=282.59999999999997s)]
*  people like that will end up voting for him. He doesn't need [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=285.56s)]
*  to do it, but he is. And it's because he doesn't care about [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=287.8s)]
*  Israel or their interests. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=290.96s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, click here to subscribe to Fox [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=292.35999999999996s)]
*  News YouTube page and catch our hottest interviews and most [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=296.0s)]
*  compelling analysis. You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFdD59qM0oU&t=299.4s)]
