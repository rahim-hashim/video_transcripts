# State Dept: ‘We have seen Hamas commit atrocities’
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg)
*  The world has to decide who to believe. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=0.0s)]
*  Do we believe the Hamas spokesperson who said that rape is forbidden, therefore it couldn't [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=5.2s)]
*  have possibly happened on October 7th? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=9.68s)]
*  Or do we believe the women whose bodies tell us how they spent the last minutes of their [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=14.6s)]
*  lives? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=21.72s)]
*  Who are we going to believe? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=24.18s)]
*  Well that was Sheryl Sandberg. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=26.599999999999998s)]
*  She joined female Israeli leaders addressing the United Nations today, sharing details [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=28.52s)]
*  about horrific sexual violence committed by Hamas terrorists, including the rape and mutilation [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=32.68s)]
*  of women taken hostage. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=38.6s)]
*  One of the women that was there, Moran Zerkazistein, founder of the Israeli Women's Rights Group. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=40.8s)]
*  The group rose to prominence earlier this year while protesting the country's judicial [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  reform plan, but since the war began, they've shifted their focus. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=51.16s)]
*  She joins us now. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=55.12s)]
*  Moran, thank you very much for joining us. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=56.12s)]
*  An incredibly difficult subject for all of us, but one that is certainly at the forefront [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=58.12s)]
*  of all of this. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=63.64s)]
*  And we just had a State Department briefing in which we learned that the spokesperson [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=65.24s)]
*  there just told one of our reporters that Israel has shared the evidence they have collected [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=69.16s)]
*  of these Hamas rapes with the Biden administration. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=75.12s)]
*  So they are going on the record now, condemning Hamas use of rape as a weapon of war against [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=79.28s)]
*  Israeli women on October 7th. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=84.64s)]
*  I want to get first your response to that. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=87.08s)]
*  It happened in a briefing just a short time ago. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=89.12s)]
*  So from one hand, I'm happy that it's happening and the truth is getting out to the world [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=94.64s)]
*  and the world understands that what happened was true, was vicious, was unhuman and the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  crimes against humanity. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=106.88s)]
*  I'm just sorry that it took 50 days. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=108.80000000000001s)]
*  I'm going to quote the State Department spokesperson directly here as we're also, by the way, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=112.67999999999999s)]
*  awaiting a White House press briefing. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=117.47999999999999s)]
*  We also know the National Security Advisor is going to be briefing from the podium today, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=120.08s)]
*  Jake Sullivan. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=124.67999999999999s)]
*  This is quoting Matt Miller. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=126.11999999999999s)]
*  Okay, I believe we've been able to turn the sound. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=128.51999999999998s)]
*  It just happened. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=130.68s)]
*  He just said this at the latest briefing at State. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=131.68s)]
*  Listen. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=134.92s)]
*  We've been asking Hamas commit atrocities both on October 7th and since October 7th [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=135.92s)]
*  and we obviously condemn those atrocities and support Israel's actions to hold Hamas [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  accountable for them. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  So to your point, it has taken a while and you look at the global response to this. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=150.23999999999998s)]
*  How would you characterize that so far and what do you want to see happen next now that [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=157.45999999999998s)]
*  we know that there is proof and there are many thousands of stories of this happening? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=164.88s)]
*  So I have to say that the U.S. government was believing and telling the story to the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=171.16s)]
*  world. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=179.32s)]
*  The ones that was disappointment was the women organization, including the U.S., the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=180.4s)]
*  UN women organization. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=185.92s)]
*  They didn't speak and when it did, it did it too little, too late and they have to understand [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=188.32s)]
*  that they are setting the tone and when they are not condemning, when they are not believing, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=194.16s)]
*  they are justifying what happened to women. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=199.72s)]
*  And I'm the founder of the largest women movement in Israel. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=202.12s)]
*  We were hugged by women organizations, how we got so many women out to the street, hundreds [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  and thousands of women and now when we need them, they don't believe us, they don't reply [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=211.64000000000001s)]
*  to us. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=216.74s)]
*  And I have to say, I want to call to activists and feminist women around the world, not just [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=217.84s)]
*  feminist organizations. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=223.2s)]
*  Rape is rape. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=225.76s)]
*  You can't contextualize rape. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=226.76s)]
*  Even if it doesn't fit your narrative, even if you don't like the Israeli government, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=230.2s)]
*  it doesn't matter what happened to Israeli women. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=233.8s)]
*  Can't happen anywhere, in any conflict, any area in the world. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  And women should speak up now. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=242.92s)]
*  And that is happening. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=246.56s)]
*  This is some of what we heard from those women who are speaking up at the UN meeting [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=248.48s)]
*  on this sexual violence. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=253.72s)]
*  When I saw the list of women's rights organizations who have said nothing, I nearly choked. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=257.15999999999997s)]
*  When evidence emerged indicating the use of rape as a weapon of war by Hamas, the voices [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=263.96s)]
*  we expected to speak up fell into the loudest silence we could have imagined. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=268.59999999999997s)]
*  Today we will scream their story, for there cannot be silence in the face of such atrocities. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=273.24s)]
*  So while they are speaking up and out, Moran, I want to play out the sound of a female sitting [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=282.08s)]
*  US Congresswoman, Jaya Paul, calling for a balance in our condemnation of what is happening [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=288.64s)]
*  in this war. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=296.32s)]
*  Listen. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=297.32s)]
*  Frankly, morally, I think we cannot say that one war crime deserves another. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  That is not what international humanitarian law says. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=303.88s)]
*  With respect, I was just asking about the women, and you turned it back to Israel. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=307.44s)]
*  I'm asking you about Hamas, in fact. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=313.2s)]
*  I already answered your question, Dana. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=314.88s)]
*  I said it's horrific. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=316.68s)]
*  However, I think we have to be balanced about bringing in the outrages against Palestinians. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=318.2s)]
*  I mean, as many times as we've now heard that, it gets more and more difficult to hear. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=327.56s)]
*  She's equating Hamas' atrocities that we were just speaking about to Israel's military [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=333.64s)]
*  campaign in response to October 7th. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=340.12s)]
*  Your response to it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=343.68s)]
*  So this is what's so disappointing. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=346.88s)]
*  You can acknowledge and emphasize the Palestinians, and it doesn't mean you can't believe and [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=349.6s)]
*  condemn what the Hamas did. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=356.32s)]
*  I have to say the Hamas is not the Palestinian people. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=357.92s)]
*  And really, what happened to Israeli women, the rape, the torture, the mutilation, it's [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=361.84s)]
*  unhuman, it's crimes against humanity. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=368.44s)]
*  And if you, as a woman, as a leader, can say those words, I don't think you are worthy [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=373.24s)]
*  for your position. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=378.88s)]
*  Just real quickly before you go, the lack of condemnation of what happened October 7th [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=380.64s)]
*  and what continues to happen there from the United Nations. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=387.32s)]
*  What is your response to that? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=391.0s)]
*  So, I think today is a turning point, and I think now more and more newspapers, media, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=393.08s)]
*  leaders around the world understand what's going on, and they will raise their voices, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=406.08s)]
*  and eventually the women organizations will have to do it as well. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=411.35999999999996s)]
*  But we will remember. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=415.08s)]
*  We will remember they didn't speak. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=416.71999999999997s)]
*  We will remember that they wasn't there. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=418.84s)]
*  Appreciate you joining us today, and we will continue to follow all the reaction to that [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=422.64s)]
*  coming up and everything that came out of that UN meeting. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=427.18s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=429.88s)]
*  Thank you very much for joining us. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=430.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVppXsXHtrg&t=433.64s)]
