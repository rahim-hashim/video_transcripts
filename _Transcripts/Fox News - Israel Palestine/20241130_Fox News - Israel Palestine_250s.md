# Here’s how Trump’s ‘unpredictability’ is making an impact on the world stage
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA)
*  So as the ceasefire deal appears to be cracking at least a little bit, where is this all heading next? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=0.0s)]
*  Author of the new book, preparing for World War III, a global conflict that redefines tomorrow. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=5.72s)]
*  Retired U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Bob McGuinness joins us now. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=11.66s)]
*  It's great to have you on the program this morning and I want to get your take on this. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=15.92s)]
*  The ceasefire appears to be intact at least for now, but ultimately the sparring isn't a great sign that it could see 60 days, is it? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=19.16s)]
*  Yeah, Jackie, we've seen this for decades and decades. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  Certainly the 2006 fight was ended with UN Resolution 1701. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=31.76s)]
*  It's almost identical to what we're seeing today. 60 days, a cool-off period. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=38.96s)]
*  Hezbollah has to move north of the Latani River, 20 miles from the border. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  And of course Israel has to extract itself from southern Lebanon, where it's been. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=49.44s)]
*  I think there's a host of issues going on. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=54.4s)]
*  Certainly for the Israelis, it's war weariness, quite frankly. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  You know, they've got the fight going in Gaza. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=63.92s)]
*  They've been attacked twice by Iran directly. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=65.68s)]
*  They have the Houthis causing problems. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=68.48s)]
*  And of course, they're getting problems out of Syria. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=71.28s)]
*  And so what they've done here recently over the last 14 months, the Israelis, is they've diminished the leadership of Hezbollah. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=74.48s)]
*  Which of course is hurting Iran's proxy war against Israel. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=84.2s)]
*  They've diminished significantly their arsenals of drones and rockets and missiles. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=89.4s)]
*  And of course their infrastructure, which are mostly underground tunnels that are all south of the Latani that are facing Israel. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=95.0s)]
*  So there are a host of issues going on here. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=102.0s)]
*  I don't expect it to last all that long into the future, at least at an intense level. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=104.64s)]
*  Because the Israelis are tired of this, but they've got to defend themselves. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=111.80000000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. I mean, they're fighting on multiple fronts here. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  But I'm wondering what you think this says about Iran being that Hezbollah, Hamas, they're Iranian proxies. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=118.72s)]
*  And an incoming Trump administration who has said it will be very tough on Iran, it will go back to a maximum pressure campaign. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=125.0s)]
*  The fact that Hezbollah would even agree to said ceasefire to me indicates that Iranians are also saying, you know what, we should back off a little too. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=133.04000000000002s)]
*  Well, you know, it's a calculation. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=141.92s)]
*  They're concerned that JCPOA, of course, is dead under Trump and they're going to get more sanctions. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=143.92s)]
*  And then of course, the U.S. is going to up its ante, perhaps militarily in the region, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=150.48s)]
*  which is going to stop more of those so-called ballistic missiles and drones that Iran would like to toss at Israel. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=155.6s)]
*  So all of these factors and mostly the unknown aspect of Mr. Trump's unpredictability is causing the Ayatollah and Tehran to really be cautious. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=163.04s)]
*  Now, my concern is that China and Russia are going to have a role here. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=173.88s)]
*  Of course, they're aligned with Iran. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=179.32s)]
*  They're helping the Houthis to make the Red Sea more dangerous. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=181.79999999999998s)]
*  And of course, they're helping Assad in Damascus. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=185.79999999999998s)]
*  So they're not going to abandon Hezbollah for now, but they're going to resupply and eventually we'll get back in a few years to much the same threat that was posed, you know, 14 months ago by Hezbollah. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=190.96s)]
*  And unfortunately, I'm hoping that we end this terrible situation in Gaza with a meaningful outcome that protects not only the remaining people there, but brings peace to the southern part of Israel. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=203.4s)]
*  And of course, there are many who are still praying for their loved ones and hoping for the return of the hostages as well. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  So a lot to get to in the new year. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=223.67999999999998s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel, we so appreciate your time. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=225.6s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  Thank you, Jackie. Have a great day. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=229.32s)]
*  You too. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=230.56s)]
*  Right now. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRkc5eoCTsA&t=248.04s)]
