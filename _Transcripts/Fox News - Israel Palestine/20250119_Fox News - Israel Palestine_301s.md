# Netanyahu is prepared to do what's necessary to get the people back, Amb Nathan Sales says
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [January 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk)
*  More on the ceasefire deal. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's bring in Nathan Sales, former ambassador at large [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=1.3800000000000001s)]
*  and counterterrorism coordinator [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=4.16s)]
*  under the first Trump administration. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=6.0s)]
*  Why now? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=10.44s)]
*  Why is this ceasefire deal coming into effect [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=12.08s)]
*  just days before the Trump administration returns to office? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=16.96s)]
*  Well, John, I think you've put your finger on it right there. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=21.64s)]
*  I think there's two factors that led to this deal [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=23.96s)]
*  being concluded here at the 11th hour. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=26.8s)]
*  The deal's been out there in the public domain [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=30.36s)]
*  for months and months, but something changed. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=32.64s)]
*  And the two things that changed were, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=34.44s)]
*  one, Donald Trump got reelected as president, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=35.68s)]
*  and that sent an unmistakable signal to Israel [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=38.44s)]
*  and the rest of the world that we have Israel's back. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=41.72s)]
*  And that makes it easier for Israel to take some risks. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=45.2s)]
*  And there's risks with any deal you make [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=48.7s)]
*  with terrorist organizations. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=51.2s)]
*  A deal with the devil is gonna inevitably involve risks. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=52.44s)]
*  But if the United States has Israel's back, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=55.6s)]
*  Netanyahu and his government are prepared [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=58.68s)]
*  to do what's necessary to get their people back. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=61.24s)]
*  And second of all, the second thing that's changed is, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  Israel has subjected Hamas and its terrorist allies [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  and its patrons in Iran to an unrelenting campaign [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=69.88s)]
*  of military pressure, eliminating leaders, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=73.7s)]
*  eliminating foot soldiers. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=76.0s)]
*  And Israel has been able to accomplish many of its war aims, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=78.08s)]
*  enabling it to take steps now to wind down hostilities [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=82.0s)]
*  and get its people back. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  We know that some of the hostages have been killed [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=87.63999999999999s)]
*  by Hamas even seconds before they were supposed to be, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=91.0s)]
*  or potentially could have been rescued. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  How do we know how many are actually remaining? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=96.91999999999999s)]
*  Well, we don't really know, John. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=100.17999999999999s)]
*  And tomorrow is going to be an emotionally [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=101.72s)]
*  very difficult day for Israel as hostages start to come out [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  because we're going to find out about what's happened [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=110.04s)]
*  to them in those terror tunnels for the past 400 plus days. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=112.64s)]
*  Some people have been killed, as you said, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=116.52000000000001s)]
*  on the precipice of being rescued. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=119.4s)]
*  The ones who survived were certainly brutalized [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  and subjected to inhumane treatment [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=124.72s)]
*  by these Hamas savages. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=126.72s)]
*  So this all goes to show the price [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=128.08s)]
*  that Israel is prepared to pay. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=130.82s)]
*  There's a social compact in Israel. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=132.56s)]
*  We will get you back, even if we have to pay [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=134.8s)]
*  an enormous price. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=137.96s)]
*  And I think what we're going to see tomorrow [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=139.5s)]
*  is a reopening of the wounds of October 7th for Israel. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=141.78s)]
*  As they celebrate the return of these hostages, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=145.74s)]
*  they're also going to feel intense emotional turmoil [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=149.94s)]
*  over what has been taken from them. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=154.3s)]
*  Yeah, and the balance is not exactly equal. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=156.14000000000001s)]
*  It's roughly 2,000 Hamas militants and arrestees [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=159.70000000000002s)]
*  who are going to be released in exchange [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=165.18s)]
*  for these first 33 hostages, right? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=167.2s)]
*  That's right, and these are the worst of the worst. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=169.95999999999998s)]
*  Some of the people who will be released [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=171.88s)]
*  from Israeli prisons, I mean, let's be clear. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=173.76s)]
*  These are not peaceful protesters or political prisoners. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=176.28s)]
*  These are hardened terrorists in many cases, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=179.48s)]
*  people who have been convicted before Israeli courts [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=181.72s)]
*  of committing murder and other crimes of violence. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=185.26s)]
*  And so as they are returned to the battlefield, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=188.48s)]
*  there's a real risk that they're going to do [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=191.95999999999998s)]
*  what terrorists always do, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=194.12s)]
*  and that is pick up an AK-47 [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=195.96s)]
*  and hunt down Jews and Israelis. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=198.28s)]
*  So I think Israel is going to keep an eye on these folks, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=200.4s)]
*  and it's significant. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=203.28s)]
*  They're not being sent to the West Bank. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=204.44s)]
*  They're going to be sent, as we understand, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=206.48s)]
*  into Gaza, a war zone. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=208.68s)]
*  So if they do something stupid and pick up a rifle, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=211.6s)]
*  I'm sure the Israelis are going to be watching. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=214.72s)]
*  President Biden, in his farewell address, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=217.24s)]
*  said that, well, he seemed to sort of take credit [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=219.84s)]
*  for this deal and said it was exactly the same terms [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=222.6s)]
*  that he had presented months ago. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=226.56s)]
*  Is that accurate? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=229.4s)]
*  And if so, why, again, are they, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=230.48s)]
*  is this deal coming to fruition [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=233.95999999999998s)]
*  so late in the Biden administration? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=235.92s)]
*  Well, you know, President Biden may believe that, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=238.6s)]
*  and some of the advisors around him, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=240.95999999999998s)]
*  even they may believe it, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  but I don't think anybody in the Middle East thinks [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=244.62s)]
*  that the Biden administration [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=247.28s)]
*  should be spiking the football with this deal. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=248.56s)]
*  It's clear to everybody in Israel, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=250.92s)]
*  everybody in the Middle East, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=253.24s)]
*  that Donald Trump's election and his threat [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=254.64s)]
*  to unleash hell on Hamas is what really created [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=257.52s)]
*  the momentum that enabled this deal to get done. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=261.52s)]
*  So, you know, ultimately it doesn't matter [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=264.28s)]
*  who gets the credit. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=266.64s)]
*  What matters is that Israel is going to get its people back, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=267.68s)]
*  but there's something a little unseemly [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=271.4s)]
*  about President Biden smirking at the camera [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=273.1s)]
*  and asking if it's a joke that President Trump [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=275.4s)]
*  had a role here in bringing these hostages home. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=278.06s)]
*  Let's hope they all come home, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=281.54s)]
*  whatever the number might be. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=284.46s)]
*  Ambassador Nathan Sales, we appreciate your time. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=286.1s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiCfMcGg_sk&t=288.5s)]
