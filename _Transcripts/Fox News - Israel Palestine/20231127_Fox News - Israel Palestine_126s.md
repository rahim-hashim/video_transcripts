# BBC editor 'doesn't regret' false Gaza reporting
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY)
*  Alright, Joey, over to you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, glad you're here. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=1.6s)]
*  Now to this. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=3.04s)]
*  BBC International editor Jeremy Bowen admits he made mistakes in his reporting on the Gaza [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=4.04s)]
*  Hospital blast last month. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=8.44s)]
*  But he says, quote, I don't regret one thing because I think I was measured throughout. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=10.84s)]
*  I didn't race to judgment. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=15.44s)]
*  Yeah, but his initial report said the explosion destroyed Al-Ali hospital. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=17.32s)]
*  It was already damaged from a smaller attack at the weekend. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=22.56s)]
*  The building was flattened. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=26.0s)]
*  Fox News contributor and columnist for The Messenger, Joe Concha, joins us now. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=27.48s)]
*  He said the building was flattened. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=32.08s)]
*  We know that's not true. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=33.64s)]
*  You know, this reporter, we don't know who he is really. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=35.08s)]
*  I'm sure many people don't know who this BBC editor is, but I think it does show a larger [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=38.36s)]
*  trend of reporters supporting, you know, the Palestinian side over Israel and then him [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=41.88s)]
*  so blatantly saying he doesn't regret what he said. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=48.34s)]
*  What do you think about all of this? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=51.16s)]
*  Well, first, that was a very moving interview you did there, Carly. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=53.0s)]
*  I'm a little teared up, so I'll try to work through this. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=57.28s)]
*  Just reminds me so much of my own son who will be turning nine this year. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=61.04s)]
*  Let's be clear without any ambiguity getting back to the topic at hand. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=65.16s)]
*  This international editor for the BBC, Jeremy Bowen, should be fired. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  It's one thing to get something wrong and be contrite about making a mistake. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  And this was obviously a big one because remember of all the violent protests that resulted [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=76.08s)]
*  from reporting from the BBC, The New York Times, CNN, Washington Post, all saying this [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=79.8s)]
*  strike was carried out by Israelis and that hundreds were dead at a hospital. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=85.16s)]
*  And for Bowen to say that he has no regrets clearly shows that he is agenda driven. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=89.92s)]
*  He is sympathetic to Hamas and he should not be in any senior position at any international [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=95.84s)]
*  news organization full stop. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=101.52s)]
*  And it's this sort of reporting. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  It's one thing to get something wrong when we're talking about politics. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=105.6s)]
*  But in this case, this is the type of stuff that could get people killed. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=108.38s)]
*  And for him to say, hey, you know what? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=111.4s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=113.16s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=114.16s)]
*  This person should not be working anywhere near any news organization, guys. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=115.16s)]
*  And I know we're out of time. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=119.24s)]
*  So that'll be it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=120.24s)]
*  It's just too much to ask for the truth. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=121.24s)]
*  Just simply the truth. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=122.92s)]
*  Joe Conta, thanks for joining us. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=123.92s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UshQmtl6tY&t=125.32s)]
