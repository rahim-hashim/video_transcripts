# Israel is 'decimating' this terrorist organization: Bush foreign policy adviser
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [September 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw)
*  An Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directly addressing the Iranian people saying [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=0.0s)]
*  their leaders stand in the way of better times. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=4.8s)]
*  And this is coming as Israel plunges Hezbollah into complete disarray by killing their chief [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=7.72s)]
*  in a daring attack and wiping out the entirety of the terror group's chain of command. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=13.16s)]
*  Want to bring in Dan Sinor, former foreign policy advisor to President Bush and host [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=17.64s)]
*  of the Must Listen To podcast, Call Me Back. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=21.32s)]
*  I believe Dan that we cannot understate the significance of this for Israel and for the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=25.52s)]
*  Jewish people. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=31.72s)]
*  But I also felt that it showed Western civilization what it was like to feel like they're on [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=32.72s)]
*  offense against terrorism. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=39.0s)]
*  Yeah, well I would say when Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke at the UN last Friday, and [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=41.04s)]
*  also when he spoke to the US Congress a little over a month ago, he said that this victory, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=48.16s)]
*  that Israel will win, this will be Israel's victory, but it will also be America's victory. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=53.88s)]
*  And I think that was an important point for two reasons. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=59.82s)]
*  One, there's no terrorist organization with the exception of Al Qaeda that has more American [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=61.96s)]
*  blood on its hands than Hezbollah. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=66.48s)]
*  Going back obviously to the embassy bombing and the bombing of the Marine barracks in [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=69.84s)]
*  Beirut in the early 80s, all the way to Ahmad Magdiya who is the leader of the Aradwan forces, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=74.28s)]
*  which is the elite commando force of the special force of Hezbollah that when I was [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=82.36s)]
*  in Iraq was responsible for a lot of the bloodshed of American soldiers in Iraq, and on and on [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=87.8s)]
*  and on. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  We can just go on example after example. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=94.03999999999999s)]
*  And here Israel is now decimating this terrorist organization that has just been slaughtering [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=95.84s)]
*  Americans for decades. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=100.72s)]
*  So that is very important. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=102.5s)]
*  Justice is served. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=104.32s)]
*  A. B. to your point, it is sending a message of what it's like to actually say, no, we're [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=105.32s)]
*  not going to do a ceasefire. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=112.48s)]
*  You don't get to launch a war against Israel and then call for a ceasefire. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=113.48s)]
*  If you look back at every mini war waged against Israel, 96, Lebanon, 2002 in the West Bank [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=116.72s)]
*  from Palestinian jihadists, you go to 2006 Lebanon war, you go down to mini wars from [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=124.4s)]
*  launched by Hamas against Israel, 2009, 2014, 2021. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=130.24s)]
*  Every one of these wars, with the exception of the 2002 war in the West Bank, every single [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=135.74s)]
*  one of them ended with a call on Israel for a ceasefire after war had been unleashed on [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=140.24s)]
*  Israel. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=145.84s)]
*  Then Israel is told, no, no, no, you can't respond the way you had planned. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=146.84s)]
*  We need to implement a ceasefire. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=149.84s)]
*  And here Israel is saying, no, no ceasefire. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=151.8s)]
*  We are going to decimate the enemy. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=154.68s)]
*  And that's an important message for the world and for the United States. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=156.08s)]
*  Ever since October 7th, President Biden has been saying to Israel, as you were saying [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=159.32000000000002s)]
*  this morning, take the win. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=163.20000000000002s)]
*  And instead, Israel said we're going to press our advantage. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=166.44s)]
*  So when it comes to Iran, what do you think is next? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=169.4s)]
*  You know, I don't know. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=173.76000000000002s)]
*  But I think if you if Israel has continued continuing to move against Hezbollah and then [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=175.36s)]
*  over the last 24 hours, they've been hitting the Houthis pretty aggressively in Yemen [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=180.28s)]
*  again, which is in the interest of the United States and the world. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=184.36s)]
*  Israel is hitting the Houthis in Yemen. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=187.72s)]
*  And I you know, all signs are now are they going to literally pursue some kind of massive [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  regime change in Iran? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=196.60000000000002s)]
*  No, I don't think Israel has the capability to do that. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=197.92s)]
*  I think Israel could only do that in partnership with the U.S. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=199.88s)]
*  and both countries, got Gulf allies in the Middle East. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=202.44s)]
*  But I I do think that Israel is look, it's mess. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=205.67999999999998s)]
*  It's when it took out Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas in Tehran a couple of months ago. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=209.48s)]
*  I think that was a message to Iran. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=214.35999999999999s)]
*  We have the capability to conduct a military operation in the heart of your regime, in [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=216.0s)]
*  your capital. And so whether it's full on war or continued operations like we've seen [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=222.0s)]
*  inside Iran, I think I think we're going to see some action. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=227.56s)]
*  Dan Zienor, thanks for getting on with us today. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHJtyft9Hw&t=231.6s)]
