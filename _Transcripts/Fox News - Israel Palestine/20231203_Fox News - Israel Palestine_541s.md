# ‘Too easy’ to forget what happened on Oct. 7: John Kirby
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4)
*  This morning I spoke with John Kirby, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=0.0s)]
*  the National Security Council [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=2.12s)]
*  Communications coordinator. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=3.7800000000000002s)]
*  So Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=6.72s)]
*  overnight about the situation in Israel, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=8.4s)]
*  and when he was asked about the role [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=10.76s)]
*  postwar of the Palestinian Authority, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=12.76s)]
*  he said this that the Palestinian [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  Authority quote pays murderers and [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  educates their children to hate Israel. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=18.12s)]
*  And to my sorrow to murder Jews and [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=20.52s)]
*  ultimately for the disappearance [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=23.0s)]
*  of the state of Israel, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=24.32s)]
*  he added we would be putting the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=25.6s)]
*  same element utterly unreformed, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=27.52s)]
*  utterly unchanged into Gaza. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=28.76s)]
*  Is that what the Biden administration [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=30.16s)]
*  expects Israel to do? Well, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=32.2s)]
*  I think he hit it right on the head [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=33.84s)]
*  when he talked about a PA that's unreformed. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=36.24s)]
*  One of the things that Secretary Blinken [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=39.0s)]
*  was talking to our Israeli counterparts [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=41.160000000000004s)]
*  about when he was there was the need to [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  reform the Palestinian Authority, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=46.32s)]
*  revitalize Palestinian Authority that [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=47.88s)]
*  is much more much more able to meet [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=49.44s)]
*  the aspirations and the needs of [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=52.0s)]
*  the Palestinian people. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=54.08s)]
*  We agree that that's not the case, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=55.08s)]
*  right now. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=57.44s)]
*  What what is the plan though? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  I mean, what would the US role be? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  Who should be governing? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=62.32s)]
*  I mean, Netanyahu has said they don't [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=63.559999999999995s)]
*  want to occupy it. They don't want [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=65.72s)]
*  to control it right? So what happens next? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=67.96s)]
*  Well, we agree with him on that too. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=70.64s)]
*  We don't want to see Israel [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=72.88s)]
*  reoccupied Gaza. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=74.67999999999999s)]
*  We don't think that that's a long term [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=75.32s)]
*  strategic goal that's that's really [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=77.72s)]
*  achievable or wise for the Israeli people. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=79.52s)]
*  We believe that at the core the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  future of governance in Gaza has got [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=83.75999999999999s)]
*  to be something that the Palestinian [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=85.92s)]
*  people have a vote in a voice in that [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=88.0s)]
*  they have they have a governance that [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=90.68s)]
*  is truly representative of them and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=93.04s)]
*  their aspirations. Now what exactly [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  that looks like Shannon we don't know, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=96.52s)]
*  but we are asking the same questions [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=98.8s)]
*  you're asking me of ourselves and of [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  our partners to see what we can do in [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=103.2s)]
*  the region working again with with [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=105.64s)]
*  both Israeli and Arab partners to see [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=107.56s)]
*  what a revitalized reformed Palestinian [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=109.8s)]
*  Authority could look like and could [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=111.72s)]
*  that reformed Palestinian Authority [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=113.84s)]
*  actually be able to govern Gaza in a [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=115.32s)]
*  way that again meets those aspirations [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=117.72s)]
*  that those are the same questions [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=119.8s)]
*  we're asking ourselves. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=121.55999999999999s)]
*  We don't have firm answers right now, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=122.72s)]
*  but but we don't believe it's too [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=124.91999999999999s)]
*  early to be looking hard at this. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=127.08s)]
*  Yeah, and there's a lot of probably [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=129.51999999999998s)]
*  heartbreak and destruction between [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=131.6s)]
*  here and there as conflict and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=132.84s)]
*  fighting has resumed in the region. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=134.6s)]
*  There's obviously coordinated message [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=136.44s)]
*  messaging out from the administration [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  this weekend about the current [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=140.0s)]
*  strategy underway in Israel. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=141.76s)]
*  Here's a little bit from the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=143.2s)]
*  Secretary of Defense here at the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=145.12s)]
*  Reagan Forum and also the vice president. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=147.16s)]
*  The center of gravity is the civilian population. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=149.88s)]
*  And if you drive them into the arms of the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=153.88s)]
*  enemy, you replace a tactical victory [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=156.4s)]
*  with a strategic defeat. No [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=158.4s)]
*  forcible displacement, no re occupation, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=160.12s)]
*  no siege or blockade. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=164.88s)]
*  So the question is, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=169.04000000000002s)]
*  is that a public message for Israel? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=170.12s)]
*  Is that a message for the more progressive [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=172.32s)]
*  wing of the president's own party who [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=174.76s)]
*  was saying things like this? No, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=176.88s)]
*  actually Shannon, you hit you hit it [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=178.76s)]
*  again in the first part of your question. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=180.84s)]
*  This is a this is a consistent message [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=183.28s)]
*  that we have been taken to our Israeli [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=185.6s)]
*  counterparts privately and of course, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=188.0s)]
*  obviously we're talking publicly [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=189.79999999999998s)]
*  too about the same big goals. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=191.12s)]
*  And I would tell you Shannon that [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=193.16s)]
*  and Secretary Blinken talked about [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=195.07999999999998s)]
*  this before he left Israel that the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=196.76s)]
*  Israelis have been receptive to those [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=198.88s)]
*  messages and just look in fact, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=200.8s)]
*  you know, if you talk about civilian casualties. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  Yes, they are conducting some shaping [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=204.60000000000002s)]
*  operations for potential moving [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=206.68s)]
*  operations in the South. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=208.76000000000002s)]
*  They've actually put up a map online [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=210.4s)]
*  that is identified for the people of Gaza, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=213.28s)]
*  areas where they should not go in [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=215.24s)]
*  areas where they can go with a measure of safety. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=217.16000000000003s)]
*  Now I don't know of too many modern [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=219.76000000000002s)]
*  militaries that actually take that extra step, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=221.16000000000003s)]
*  so they clearly are trying to make an [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=223.8s)]
*  effort to be more precise and more cautious here. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=226.28s)]
*  And that's of course something we've [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=228.52s)]
*  been urging them to do literally [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=229.76s)]
*  from the beginning of the conflict. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=231.95999999999998s)]
*  That's not something that a current [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=234.56s)]
*  sitting congresswoman believes is actually happening. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=236.28s)]
*  Here's her take on what's happening [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=238.84s)]
*  in our role in it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=240.92s)]
*  What we are witnessing is the gross [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=243.67999999999998s)]
*  violation of human rights in Gaza, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=246.6s)]
*  and that is being done with US military assistance. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=249.64s)]
*  So what is your message to her and [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=256.15999999999997s)]
*  others on the progressive left of the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=257.71999999999997s)]
*  president's party who are saying these things publicly? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=259.36s)]
*  What's being done with US military [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=261.52000000000004s)]
*  and security assistance is helping our [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=263.28000000000003s)]
*  friend and partner Israel go after a [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=266.2s)]
*  truly genocidal threat, a threat posed by Hamas. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=268.6s)]
*  And I think it's just too easy as we get [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=271.92s)]
*  further and further away from the 7th of October [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=274.0s)]
*  to forget what happened on that day. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=276.24s)]
*  1200 Israelis literally slaughtered, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=277.68s)]
*  kids in front of their parents, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=280.04s)]
*  parents in front of their kids. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=281.6s)]
*  And we've got to help Israel eliminate [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=283.64s)]
*  the threat to the Israeli nation and [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=286.44s)]
*  Israeli people from that threat, from Hamas. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=288.52s)]
*  And we're going to keep doing that. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=290.68s)]
*  Absolutely. Now look at the same time, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=291.96s)]
*  just like you and I've been talking now [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=293.91999999999996s)]
*  for a few minutes, we want them to do it [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=295.24s)]
*  in the most careful, cautious, deliberate way possible. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=297.24s)]
*  How they do this matters, as Secretary Blinken has said, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=299.68s)]
*  and we're continuing to work with them. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=302.35999999999996s)]
*  And again, I would stress that the Israelis [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=303.88s)]
*  have been receptive to those messages, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=305.88s)]
*  and they have actually altered the way [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=307.79999999999995s)]
*  they have been conducting some of their operations. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=309.28s)]
*  Now I also want to say clearly, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=311.32s)]
*  too many thousands of individual civilians [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=313.4s)]
*  have been killed, too many more thousands [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=315.71999999999997s)]
*  have been wounded. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=318.04s)]
*  We have more than a million that have been [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=318.8s)]
*  internally displaced in Gaza. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=320.24s)]
*  We're not blind to the humanitarian crisis, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=321.88s)]
*  which is why we work so hard to get that pause [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=323.88s)]
*  in place for seven days, so that we can get hostages out [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=326.6s)]
*  and get an accelerated amount of food, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=329.36s)]
*  water, medicine and fuel into Gaza. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=331.88s)]
*  So we're certainly working on the humanitarian plight here. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=334.04s)]
*  But I think we've got to stay core [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=337.44s)]
*  to what happened on the 7th of October [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=339.48s)]
*  and remember the threat that the Israeli people [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=341.24s)]
*  are still facing from Hamas. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=343.48s)]
*  Yeah, and it's existential. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=346.0s)]
*  But critics of the guidance or the conversations [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=347.76s)]
*  that we're having publicly and privately with Israel [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=350.92s)]
*  say that the Biden administration is making demands [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=353.59999999999997s)]
*  that Israel cannot actually fulfill. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=356.52s)]
*  Here's from the Wall Street Journal editorial board. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=358.28s)]
*  If Israel must do more to protect civilians, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=360.48s)]
*  but can't evacuate them and can't hit Hamas, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=362.92s)]
*  when it hides in key civilian infrastructure and safe zones, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=365.71999999999997s)]
*  how is it to fight at all? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=368.76s)]
*  Israel deserves US support as it topples Hamas, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=371.2s)]
*  not a repeat of Mr. Biden's Ukraine treatment, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=373.88s)]
*  they say was rules, restrictions and hesitations [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=376.56s)]
*  that push a decisive victory further away. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=379.2s)]
*  How much of this council that you're having privately [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=382.08s)]
*  with Israel requires them to pass any decisions by us [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=384.79999999999995s)]
*  before they take them? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=390.84s)]
*  None, I mean, that argument just isn't in comport [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=391.76s)]
*  with the facts that we're laying down restrictions [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=395.4s)]
*  or sort of red lines for Israel. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=398.12s)]
*  Israel is a sovereign nation, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=400.0s)]
*  attacked in a brutal way on the 7th of October. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=402.35999999999996s)]
*  They have every right and responsibility [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=405.32s)]
*  to go after the terrorist group [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=407.2s)]
*  that perpetrated those attacks and planned them. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=408.8s)]
*  And oh, by the way, has made it clear [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=411.12s)]
*  they're gonna do it again and do more. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=412.71999999999997s)]
*  They have every right and responsibility to go after them. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=414.5s)]
*  We would do the same thing, any nation would. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=416.71999999999997s)]
*  Now, what we have done is talk to them, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=419.08s)]
*  share our perspectives and our lessons learned [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=420.86s)]
*  about urban warfare, as Secretary Austin said, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=422.94s)]
*  about not turning a tactical victory into a strategic defeat. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=425.84s)]
*  Of course, we're gonna share that, that's what friends do. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=428.92s)]
*  But they're making these decisions. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=431.28s)]
*  They're deciding the targets that they're gonna hit. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=432.64s)]
*  Obviously, we'll continue to talk to them [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=435.08000000000004s)]
*  about being as careful and cautious as possible. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=436.56s)]
*  We don't wanna see any more innocent civilians killed. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=439.0s)]
*  And I don't think the Wall Street Journal wants that either. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=441.68s)]
*  But we are not gonna stop giving them the security assistance [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=444.08000000000004s)]
*  that they need to go after this, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=447.8s)]
*  as you quite accurately put it, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=449.16s)]
*  an existential threat to the Israeli people. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=451.04s)]
*  Quickly, I wanna make sure that we ask, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=454.84000000000003s)]
*  how many Americans do we think are still hostages? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=456.54s)]
*  Why don't we have them back? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=459.32s)]
*  When do we get them back? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=460.32s)]
*  Well, Shannon, we think the number, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=461.36s)]
*  obviously, somewhere in the neighborhood of eight to nine, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=462.96000000000004s)]
*  probably more like nine. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=465.40000000000003s)]
*  We don't have perfect visibility on all of those Americans. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=466.52000000000004s)]
*  So that's why we're being a little bit careful [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=469.68s)]
*  with the specificity of the numbers. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=471.2s)]
*  But that's kind of the population that we believe it is. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=473.72s)]
*  We know that there's at least one other American woman [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=477.6s)]
*  who's unaccounted for. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=480.70000000000005s)]
*  We don't know much about her, her condition, where she is. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=481.64s)]
*  And I would say the same thing, unfortunately, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=484.68s)]
*  about the other Americans that are being held hostages. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=486.44s)]
*  We just don't have perfect visibility. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=488.72s)]
*  Now, we're getting some information from the families [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=490.76s)]
*  who at least are helping us understand [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=493.71999999999997s)]
*  why they believe their loved ones were taken hostage. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=495.59999999999997s)]
*  And the Israelis are also trying to flesh out [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=497.84s)]
*  some of our information. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=500.15999999999997s)]
*  But we're working at this literally by the hour. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=501.28s)]
*  We wanna get that pause put back in place [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=503.23999999999995s)]
*  so that again, more hostages can come out. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=505.9s)]
*  I'll say this, two things, if you'll allow me. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=508.35999999999996s)]
*  One, Hamas is the reason that the pause ended, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=510.28s)]
*  because they refused to put on the list [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=513.12s)]
*  additional women and children that we know [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=515.52s)]
*  that they are holding, and they're refusing to let go. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=517.9599999999999s)]
*  And two, we're working at literally by the hour [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=520.96s)]
*  to see if we can't get this back on track. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=523.72s)]
*  John Kirby, we always appreciate your time. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkQbgIs4C4&t=527.08s)]
