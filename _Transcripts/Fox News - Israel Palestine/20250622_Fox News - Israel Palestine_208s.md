# 'ASYMETRIC THREAT': DeSantis says Iran 'cannot match' US after strikes
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ2wHQxrp2A)
*  There are still hundreds of thousands of Americans in Israel who were stranded there for the past week [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ2wHQxrp2A&t=0.0s)]
*  with Israeli airspace all but shut down. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has done many efforts to get [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ2wHQxrp2A&t=4.96s)]
*  people home, more than 1,500 people back to America. The governor joins me right now. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ2wHQxrp2A&t=11.36s)]
*  Governor, thank you for being here. Your reaction to what has taken place? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ2wHQxrp2A&t=16.4s)]
*  Well, President Trump's policy has been consistent and correct that Iran cannot have nuclear weapons. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ2wHQxrp2A&t=21.76s)]
*  And his actions last night put force behind that policy in a way that I think is going to be very [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ2wHQxrp2A&t=27.36s)]
*  beneficial for the U.S. interests and the broader world. Think about it. Under President Biden, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ2wHQxrp2A&t=33.68s)]
*  Iran was on a surefire path to a nuclear weapon. Now, thanks to President Trump's actions, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ2wHQxrp2A&t=38.64s)]
*  Iran going nuclear is a pipe dream at this point. So it was the correct decision. It was expertly [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ2wHQxrp2A&t=43.84s)]
*  executed. And hats off to everybody that's been involved in that. And I think that we understood [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ2wHQxrp2A&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  when the first war broke out with Israel and Iran, this was going to have implications for [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ2wHQxrp2A&t=57.12s)]
*  our country one way or another. And in Florida, we knew just as a matter of fact, we had a lot [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ2wHQxrp2A&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  of our residents that were over in Israel as these ballistic missiles were raining down. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ2wHQxrp2A&t=66.24s)]
*  Ben Gurion Airport, as you mentioned, was shut down. And so how do you get these people back? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ2wHQxrp2A&t=71.2s)]
*  Now, we rescued many people after the Hamas attacks on October 7th, 2023. We've also rescued [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ2wHQxrp2A&t=75.68s)]
*  Floridians and other Americans from instability in Haiti. And so we sprung into action. We were [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ2wHQxrp2A&t=82.08s)]
*  able to get 1,500 during the first week out of Israel, and we're now running flights. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ2wHQxrp2A&t=87.12s)]
*  We've had hundreds of people repatriated back to Florida. I was in Tampa the other day greeting [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ2wHQxrp2A&t=92.32s)]
*  people in the wee hours of the morning. And it's a difficult situation. If you're a college student [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ2wHQxrp2A&t=98.0s)]
*  over there studying abroad or if you're there with your family, all of a sudden you're in this midst [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ2wHQxrp2A&t=103.2s)]
*  of a situation which is very, very dicey. So those operations are ongoing. We're going to [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ2wHQxrp2A&t=108.32s)]
*  continue to help rescue our fellow Floridians and fellow Americans when they need help. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ2wHQxrp2A&t=113.44s)]
*  Thank you for those flights from Tel Aviv to Tampa. Very effective. Governor, when you were [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ2wHQxrp2A&t=118.32s)]
*  in the House of Representatives, you also studied the Iran conflict. Do you expect retaliation? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ2wHQxrp2A&t=123.28s)]
*  Well, Iran has always been an asymmetric threat, Maria, in the sense that that was one of the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ2wHQxrp2A&t=132.0s)]
*  reasons the nuclear problem was such a big issue, because they're militant Islamists. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ2wHQxrp2A&t=136.4s)]
*  And so using nuclear weapons, even if there was a devastating response against them, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ2wHQxrp2A&t=141.68s)]
*  that may be an inducement for them to use it, given their radical ideology. I would imagine a [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ2wHQxrp2A&t=146.8s)]
*  conventional response is not going to be very effective against the United States. They are not [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ2wHQxrp2A&t=152.72s)]
*  a match for us there. But I do think that they will try to work through their proxies to deliver [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ2wHQxrp2A&t=157.44s)]
*  more terrorism in the region. And as you mentioned earlier in your show, President Biden led in [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ2wHQxrp2A&t=164.4s)]
*  massive numbers of people during his administration. Are we to believe that Iran, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ2wHQxrp2A&t=170.08s)]
*  who they view us as the great Satan, that they just didn't want to take advantage of that? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ2wHQxrp2A&t=175.52s)]
*  I think it's probably the case that they did. So I think it'll be more of an asymmetric response. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ2wHQxrp2A&t=179.52s)]
*  I don't think that they can match the United States conventionally. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ2wHQxrp2A&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  Governor, thank you very much. We'll be watching your work in Florida. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ2wHQxrp2A&t=187.6s)]
