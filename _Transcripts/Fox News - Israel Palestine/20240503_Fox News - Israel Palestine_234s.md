# Frat brother who helped save American flag during anti-Israel protest speaks out
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [May 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U)
*  All right, by now you may have seen the viral moment from UNC where a group of fraternity [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=0.0s)]
*  brothers faced off with a mob to protect the American flag. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=4.64s)]
*  Joining us now, one of those fraternity brothers, UNC student, is Isaac Mala. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=20.44s)]
*  Isaac, what motivated you to defend the flag? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=25.6s)]
*  Yeah, well, first of all, thanks for having me on. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=28.64s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=32.0s)]
*  And I'll say when we talk about motivation for the flag, the primary reason I was on [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=33.64s)]
*  that quad, right, before this ever even began to become an American issue, I was on there [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=37.56s)]
*  because I'm Jewish and I'm Orthodox and a lot of members that were holding up that flag [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=42.0s)]
*  were. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=46.24s)]
*  And so we were there really just kind of holding up our Israeli flags and trying to stop hate. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=47.64s)]
*  There's been a lot of anti-Semitism around the country. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=52.96s)]
*  So we were there first and foremost for our country of Israel. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=55.760000000000005s)]
*  When this becomes an American issue, that hits kind of double hard. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=58.38s)]
*  And that really hits us both in our religious country and our home one that we really feel [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=61.96s)]
*  is deeply important to us. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=67.84s)]
*  I've seen a lot about us being heroes or unbelievable people. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=69.64s)]
*  It's none of that. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=73.6s)]
*  We see a country that we love and we believe in and we stand for its values being desecrated. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=75.06s)]
*  And we didn't want to sit by and just let it happen. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=80.52s)]
*  So were you trying to protect the Israeli flag or the American flag or both? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=84.72s)]
*  So initially there was no protection of the Israeli flag. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=89.96s)]
*  We just wanted the Jewish students on campus to have their voice heard. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=92.46s)]
*  Very much like I'm here today to have my voice heard. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=96.06s)]
*  We wanted that to be on campus as well. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=97.88s)]
*  When the American flag became, I guess, in danger is the word you can use, when we saw [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=100.12s)]
*  that it started to be lowered and began to be ripped off, especially on a day where four [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=103.44s)]
*  officers were shot and killed less than two hours away from campus. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=108.12s)]
*  We have a flag that's hanging at half mass because those that commit their lives to serve [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=112.04s)]
*  our country and to serve our states are being shot down and killed. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=115.44000000000001s)]
*  That's the flag you're going to rip down? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=118.72s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=120.36000000000001s)]
*  Not on that day. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=121.44000000000001s)]
*  And so I'm honestly very proud of our administration because they shut it down immediately and [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=122.44000000000001s)]
*  I'm very thankful for that. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  So Isaac, I want to show viewers what everything looked like from your angle. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=128.8s)]
*  This is a video from one of your buddies. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=133.32s)]
*  Watch. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=135.36s)]
*  Fascists, fascists, fascists, fascists, fascists, fascists. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=138.04s)]
*  Fascists. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=147.68s)]
*  Wait a second. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=148.68s)]
*  Do they understand how stupid that sounds? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=149.68s)]
*  So wait, as a Jewish student you're a fascist? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=152.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=155.88s)]
*  I mean, these are just dumb people. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=156.88s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=158.35999999999999s)]
*  They're not bright people. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  And I know you're graduating as a junior, which is impressive, but these people haven't [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=160.35999999999999s)]
*  read a book, it sounds, or they don't know basic history. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=164.62s)]
*  Uh, Laura, I was called a Nazi today, so, you know, I don't really understand how that [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=167.72s)]
*  makes any sense, to be completely honest. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=174.0s)]
*  Um, none of this makes sense to me. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=176.56s)]
*  This is a country that has given people the ability to protest and to have their voice [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=179.46s)]
*  heard and I wholeheartedly respect that, regardless of your political affiliation, regardless [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=183.6s)]
*  of whether or not you believe what I believe. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=188.24s)]
*  That's not what matters. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=190.44s)]
*  Um, and yet, when we do that and when we try to protect the flag we love, my friend stands [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=191.44s)]
*  next to me, has a water bottle hit in his face, still has a black eye and is bleeding. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=197.36s)]
*  I don't, I really don't get it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=201.04000000000002s)]
*  Isaac, um, thank you for joining us and telling this story tonight and thank you for doing [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=204.12s)]
*  what you did. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=209.46s)]
*  Um, we really appreciate it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=210.46s)]
*  Alright, why can't President Trump talk about his trial? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  But Michael Cohen, Joe Biden, they can. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=215.4s)]
*  The latest from the courtroom next. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=218.0s)]
*  And most compelling analysis, you will not get it anywhere else. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rm1B6Kq13U&t=227.36s)]
