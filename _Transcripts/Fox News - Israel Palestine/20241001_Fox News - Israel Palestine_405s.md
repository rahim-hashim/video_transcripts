# Retired general warns Iran's situation is 'much more fragile' than people realize
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8)
*  Let's bring in retired four-star general Jack Keane, former Army Vice Chief of Staff, now [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=0.0s)]
*  Chairman of the Institute for the Study of War, and Fox News' senior strategic analyst [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=5.68s)]
*  general. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=10.84s)]
*  Good to have you with us. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=11.84s)]
*  We have not heard from you yet so far on this breaking news. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=12.84s)]
*  Tell us your reaction, sir. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=15.88s)]
*  Well, certainly, Iran launching 200 missiles against Israel is a significant event in itself, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=18.76s)]
*  but also providing early warning that that event is taking place is also pretty significant. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=25.92s)]
*  What's going on with the Iranians here? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=32.0s)]
*  I believe the Iranians have been back on their heels for some time now, ever since Hanaiya [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=34.0s)]
*  was killed in a high-security zone where many of their senior leaders live. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=40.040000000000006s)]
*  And they promised retaliation, and eight weeks later, I think we're almost in the ninth week, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=46.0s)]
*  there's finally some retaliation. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=51.44s)]
*  My Israeli sources, relatively high, told me that Hamas, very frustrated with Iran over [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=53.879999999999995s)]
*  this, Hezbollah, very frustrated that they didn't get more support out of Iran. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=60.6s)]
*  And I think the Iranians are calculating. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=65.56s)]
*  They want their proxies to do the work for them. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=67.56s)]
*  That was the concept from the beginning. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=69.53999999999999s)]
*  But I believe that given the tenuous situation that they have domestically in the country, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=71.96s)]
*  my sources also tell me it's a much more fragile situation than many people realize. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=77.74s)]
*  So what's the early warning all about? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=83.2s)]
*  I think that's what it's all about, is letting Israel know the attack is coming, about when [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=85.48s)]
*  it's coming, to minimize the casualties so there is not a very effective response back [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=91.0s)]
*  on Iran that would put pressure on that domestic population. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=97.64s)]
*  And I think that's exactly what we should do, frankly. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=102.52000000000001s)]
*  And I think the United States should make up its mind to take the Houthis off the board. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=106.0s)]
*  They have shut down the Suez Canal for months. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=111.52s)]
*  They fired on U.S. Navy warships with anti-ship ballistic missiles and we're still playing [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=114.2s)]
*  defense with these guys. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=118.88s)]
*  It makes no sense whatsoever. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=120.68s)]
*  I'm assuming the United States had a role to play tonight in helping Israel, and that's [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=123.0s)]
*  certainly very worthy and we've got enormous capability. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=127.24s)]
*  And I think the Israelis will probably attack sooner rather than later. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=130.56s)]
*  So General, I want to go back to what you just laid out there because you're suggesting, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=136.18s)]
*  and correct me if I'm wrong, that Iran is in such a complex position right now, the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=141.42000000000002s)]
*  leadership in Iran, and we've seen the hierarchy chart of which everyone is knocked out, although [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=147.10000000000002s)]
*  there's a lot of deputies underneath those people, but that they essentially needed for [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=153.42000000000002s)]
*  their own power in their own country to show this display of an enormous missile strike [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=157.78s)]
*  on Israel in order to sort of let their own people know, look, we're responding to these [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=164.26s)]
*  hits against Nasrallah and Henneah. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=171.05999999999997s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=173.45999999999998s)]
*  And if that's the case, what do you think Israel does do next? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=174.45999999999998s)]
*  Well, I think they'll calculate that they responded very lightly the last time, just [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=180.38s)]
*  taking down an air defense facility right outside Natanz, which is a nuclear enterprise. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=187.14s)]
*  They did that internally from the country, and I think they wanted to show a little bit [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=193.04s)]
*  of leg there that they could do something like that and not have to penetrate Israeli [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=197.67999999999998s)]
*  airspace, but at the same time, you know, they weren't doing any real damage. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=202.16s)]
*  This time I think they're going to take some action. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=206.39999999999998s)]
*  It likely would be more forcible, more comprehensive, but also you have to keep in mind the main [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=208.64s)]
*  effort that Israeli, Israel is conducting right now is where? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=215.23999999999998s)]
*  It's in Lebanon. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=220.23999999999998s)]
*  They've got a ground incursion going on and they've got a systematic campaign to take [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=221.79999999999998s)]
*  down as many leaders as they can and as much of the rocket launchers and missiles and other [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=226.32s)]
*  infrastructure that they have there. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=232.32s)]
*  So that is their main effort. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=234.44s)]
*  But I do think they'll seize the opportunity that the Iranians have presented to them. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=236.84s)]
*  And even though there's no casualties here, I mean, this is a major event. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=242.72s)]
*  200 ballistic missiles is significant, and I don't see how the Israelis can ignore that [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=247.16s)]
*  and just go punch back lightly like they did the last time. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=253.4s)]
*  And I think they're very sensitive to the fact that Iran's leadership is in a much more [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=258.08s)]
*  fragile position with their domestic population. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=263.32s)]
*  And I think they may be more sensitive to that than the United States is. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=267.6s)]
*  We share intelligence, so I'm assuming both of us are aware of it, but the Israelis are [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=271.92s)]
*  more sensitive to it in terms of wanting to do something about it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=276.20000000000005s)]
*  The United States, I don't think, wants to do anything about it, to be frank about it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=280.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, and I want to get to that with you. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=283.40000000000003s)]
*  But it's interesting. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=285.08000000000004s)]
*  I was listening to General Kellogg before and he was talking about Netanyahu and what [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=286.6s)]
*  he has accomplished, which has been extraordinary. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=290.48s)]
*  You think about this pager attack, you think about the decapitation of so many of these [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=293.04s)]
*  leaders across the board. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=298.28000000000003s)]
*  And I'm thinking also about Netanyahu at the UN. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=300.0s)]
*  And he showed one chart called the blessing and one chart called the curse. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=303.48s)]
*  And the blessing is a future in the Middle East that has the Arab states and Israel and [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=307.96s)]
*  Saudi Arabia pushing towards a more advanced economic strong future for the region. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=314.12s)]
*  And the curse was Iranian leadership. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=320.3s)]
*  So if Iran is back on its heels, as you say, is this not the moment to take advantage of [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=322.3s)]
*  this and to push them further back and perhaps give the Iranian people a chance at brand [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=328.56s)]
*  new leadership in their country, General? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=334.92s)]
*  Yeah, well, you put your finger right on it. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=338.4s)]
*  I don't want to be polyamorous about it and say, you know, there's going to be an overthrow [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=340.0s)]
*  to regime next week or so, but it takes time. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=342.96s)]
*  And I think it is time to push back here and certainly develop that situation. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=346.72s)]
*  And what the Israelis have done in Lebanon is absolutely stunning and unprecedented in [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=353.84s)]
*  my frame of reference. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=359.84s)]
*  I think it's something they've been planning, obviously, for a very long time. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=361.64s)]
*  And Netanyahu made a commitment to up his game here. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=365.76s)]
*  He knew full well the United States wasn't with him. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=369.58s)]
*  What the United States wants to do is stop. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=372.36s)]
*  They want to stop all the shooting in Gaza, in Lebanon. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=374.84s)]
*  Just stop it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=379.59999999999997s)]
*  Stop it with the Houthis. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=380.59999999999997s)]
*  And take the status quo. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=382.84s)]
*  And the status quo is totally unsatisfactory to the Israelis. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=384.67999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, indeed. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=387.91999999999996s)]
*  We heard President Biden say stop and ceasefire. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=389.0s)]
*  General Keene, thank you very much. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8&t=391.23999999999995s)]
