# Trump in 'direct talks' with Iran: 'The goals have not changed'
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM)
*  So, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu becoming the first foreign leader to meet with President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump since his tariffs went into place. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=4.8s)]
*  U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce joins us now. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=7.2s)]
*  Tammy, we know about where the Israelis stand when it comes to trade, but I also know they're [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=10.08s)]
*  going to be talking about what happens when it comes to Gaza. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=14.64s)]
*  The reports are they now control 50 percent of Gaza, and for the first time they are clearing [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=17.64s)]
*  and holding land. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=23.66s)]
*  What's their objective now as it relates to the hostages? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=25.44s)]
*  Well, I'm sure not having been in that meeting, but we know that what the president has said [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=28.12s)]
*  and what Secretary Marco Rubio has said for the State Department is that the hostages [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=32.96s)]
*  have to be released, Hamas cannot continue to have any role or exist in Gaza, and the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=37.92s)]
*  president has noted, of course, a constant work for a ceasefire. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  None of that has changed. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=47.68s)]
*  All of this is happening because of what Hamas has done. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  Israel continues to defend itself, and in our case, of course, we continue to argue [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=52.64s)]
*  and push for and demand a release of the hostages that are still being held, including [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=57.16s)]
*  an American hostage, of course, Aidan Alexander, and a need for a ceasefire, which we [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=63.32s)]
*  were on. We had one. We are on track for a second phase. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=69.84s)]
*  Hamas decided never mind. And that's where we're at. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=73.52s)]
*  So the goals have not changed, certainly not for us, not for the State Department and [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=76.36s)]
*  not for the American people. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=81.92s)]
*  Have you heard a proposal or are we presenting a proposal for the day after the fighting [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=83.36s)]
*  starts, stops and the hostages are returned? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=87.8s)]
*  What is the image of what Gaza would look like? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=91.24s)]
*  Or are we still working that out? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=93.96s)]
*  Well, what the president has said and what Secretary Rubio has reminded people is that [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=95.83999999999999s)]
*  nothing can really happen until there is the fighting stops and the carnage ends and the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=101.0s)]
*  hostages are released. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  The president has issued a number of different ideas, but he has he's made it clear to [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=107.52s)]
*  everyone in the region there has to be a new idea. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=111.96000000000001s)]
*  It cannot be what it's been before. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=114.84s)]
*  We have to make sure this does not keep happening every generation. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=117.0s)]
*  So what it looks like afterwards is, in fact, if we will be successful, is that Hamas will [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=121.04s)]
*  not exist. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=127.76s)]
*  There will finally be an end to the carnage. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=128.76s)]
*  And then the region and the world will be able to work on how to get especially the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=130.84s)]
*  first victims of Hamas, the Gazan people into a framework where they can have a future they [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=135.76s)]
*  can rely on. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=141.32s)]
*  We were surprised to get this and intrigued when we heard this announcement from the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=142.32s)]
*  president yesterday. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=146.44s)]
*  We're having direct talks with Iran and they've started it'll go on Saturday. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=149.44s)]
*  We have a very big meeting and we'll see what can happen. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=156.28s)]
*  I think if the talks aren't successful with Iran, I think Iran is going to be in great [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=159.64s)]
*  danger. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=165.64s)]
*  And I hate to say it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=166.64s)]
*  Great danger because they can't have a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=168.4s)]
*  I know we're sending another aircraft carrier steaming to the region. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=171.04s)]
*  The Iranians come back and say these aren't direct talks. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=174.67999999999998s)]
*  They said they will be indirect talks. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=177.72s)]
*  You'll be in separate rooms and go to an intermediary. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=179.23999999999998s)]
*  What could you tell us? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=182.5s)]
*  Well, you know, they're at the table and they understand to take President Trump seriously. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=183.5s)]
*  They know that he's a man who does what he says, he means what he says, and they're suddenly [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=188.68s)]
*  at the table. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=193.84s)]
*  And this is the difference when it comes to a powerful leadership, leadership that makes [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=195.12s)]
*  it clear to the enemies of humanity that they had better stop doing what they're doing and [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=199.88000000000002s)]
*  do as we tell them effectively, which is to stop the terrorism, stop in this case, certainly [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=205.64000000000001s)]
*  the seeking of a nuclear weapon and of nuclear framework when it comes to the nature of what [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=212.04000000000002s)]
*  they say. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=219.16000000000003s)]
*  It's of course for peaceful civilian purposes. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=220.16000000000003s)]
*  But of course, Iran is the world's largest sponsor of terrorism. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=223.16000000000003s)]
*  So we know what they're doing. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=227.54000000000002s)]
*  The president has said they will not have a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=228.64s)]
*  He is serious. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=231.72s)]
*  He's going to make sure and I think they know he's serious. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=232.72s)]
*  So that's what's happening here. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=236.11999999999998s)]
*  And it's of course going to make not just America safer, but the world safer. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=237.32s)]
*  And the only person who could have done this is President Trump alongside a cabinet that [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=242.0s)]
*  also takes all of this very seriously for the world. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=246.48s)]
*  Will Secretary of State Marco Rubio be leading those talks on Saturday? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=249.76s)]
*  Well, we know that the secretary of state has been involved in the peace talks for Russia, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=254.04s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=259.64s)]
*  He is, of course, the leader when it comes to America's diplomacy. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=260.64s)]
*  He is, in fact, I think safe to say the world's leading diplomat. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=264.16s)]
*  So clearly without being involved in the nature of negotiations or diplomatic planning, Secretary [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=269.08s)]
*  Rubio has made a huge difference already around the world. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=276.6s)]
*  And I think that we're going to see an imprint from him as directed by President Trump on [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=279.44s)]
*  this dynamic as well. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=284.24s)]
*  So it's not, we don't know if it's going to be Steve Witkoff or it's going to be Marco [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=285.58s)]
*  Rubio. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=288.6s)]
*  Your secretary of state Marco Rubio yet? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=289.6s)]
*  Well, I'm not going to speak about who is going to be in a negotiating position. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=291.52s)]
*  The president noted it would be almost the highest ranks, almost the top people. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=296.0s)]
*  But we'll eventually find out. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=301.32s)]
*  But I'm certainly, I can't discuss that at this point. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=302.84s)]
*  Yesterday the president said from here on in, every time the Houthi rebels attack a ship [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=305.48s)]
*  in the Suez Canal or the surrounding area, is they're going to consider an attack from [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=311.36s)]
*  Iran. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=315.52000000000004s)]
*  Do you think that means we will hit them back immediately, hit Iran back instead of hitting [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=316.52000000000004s)]
*  the Houthi rebels back? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=321.12s)]
*  Well, I'm not going to speculate. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=322.44s)]
*  This is not a situation I can speculate on, nor would I. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=324.92s)]
*  But one thing that the world knows, whether it's the Houthis or our allies or the bad [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=329.28000000000003s)]
*  guys, is that you can trust America to do what's necessary to certainly defend this [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=333.92s)]
*  country. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=339.28s)]
*  And it will act on, certainly under the Trump administration, it will act on our word and [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=340.28s)]
*  our understanding that across the board, that the carnage that is unleashed around the world, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=344.52s)]
*  that has been allowed to go on in just 11 weeks of the Trump administration, that we [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=350.28s)]
*  are taking care of business. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=355.48s)]
*  The president wants peace around the world everywhere where the terrorist nations are [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=356.96s)]
*  implementing terrorism and mass carnage, that we are the ones who are going to stop it. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=363.12s)]
*  And that's part of it. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=369.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, there's a report from Reuters saying the Iranian-sponsored Iraqi militias are going [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=370.03999999999996s)]
*  to put down their weapons and no longer attack American assets. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=375.8s)]
*  Do you believe that? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=379.88s)]
*  Well, we'll see. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=380.88s)]
*  Actions matter. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=382.64s)]
*  So we'll see about actions. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=383.96s)]
*  And this is just like America. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=385.2s)]
*  We take action. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=386.68s)]
*  You can believe the president and what he's going to do. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=387.79999999999995s)]
*  I think that decisions are usually made when it comes to what people do versus what they say. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=390.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=395.7s)]
*  We know one thing, the region only understands strength and President Trump is showing a lot of strength. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=396.7s)]
*  Tammy, Bruce, thanks so much. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=400.42s)]
*  We look forward to seeing what happens Saturday. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=401.78s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=403.98s)]
*  Very exciting. Thank you. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGLVgdyPLbM&t=404.98s)]
