# 'Teaching and preaching antisemitism': Former Harvard professor issues warning
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg)
*  I want to bring in now Alan Dershowitz, longtime civil liberties attorney who taught at Harvard [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=0.0s)]
*  University law for nearly four decades. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=5.28s)]
*  Alan, thank you so very much for being in focus today. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  First of all, I'm curious to know just from your personal perspective, are you keeping [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=12.16s)]
*  in touch with people still on that campus? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=16.68s)]
*  And what are you hearing from inside the campus, from the Jewish community in particular? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=18.92s)]
*  Well, first of all, I've been banned essentially from the Harvard campus for the last 12 years [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=23.84s)]
*  since I retired. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=28.96s)]
*  People at Harvard don't want to hear my points of view on President Trump. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=31.12s)]
*  They don't want to hear my points of view on Israel. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=34.36s)]
*  They don't want to hear my points of view on Western values. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=36.44s)]
*  So I am persona non grata at Harvard. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=40.4s)]
*  The only time I've ever been invited back by a student group, my speech had to be taken [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=42.84s)]
*  off campus for fear of my physical safety. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=47.16s)]
*  But yes, by telephone, I am in touch. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=50.36s)]
*  Harvard has become a bastion of left wing, just similar points of view. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=52.72s)]
*  Not only do they tolerate anti-Semitism, they teach it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=62.84s)]
*  According to a Harvard report, they teach anti-Semitism in the Divinity School, particularly [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=66.68s)]
*  how horrible that is in the name of Christianity. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=71.48s)]
*  They teach anti-Semitism. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=74.4s)]
*  They teach it in the School of Public Health. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=76.2s)]
*  They named as their speaker at the graduation at the Divinity School, the class marshal, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=79.8s)]
*  was a thug who had intimidated, threatened, and harassed an Israeli student. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=87.2s)]
*  The school said they would punish him for it, but they didn't. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=92.88000000000001s)]
*  The law school gave a $65,000 scholarship to one of the other thugs who had harassed [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=95.44s)]
*  a Jewish student, and they gave him the $65,000 to work for an anti-Israel organization that [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=100.84s)]
*  promotes hatred against Jews. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=110.36s)]
*  So Harvard is deeply, deeply complicit in anti-Semitism, anti-Americanism, and something [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  has to be done about it. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=118.16s)]
*  And President Trump is starting in the right way. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=120.2s)]
*  Look, prevention is the key, preventing these things from happening. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=123.68s)]
*  I just published a new book, my 57th book. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=129.92s)]
*  It's called The Preventive State, and it's all about how to prevent these things from happening. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  And one of the major tactics that's been used to prevent over the years has been deportation [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=137.76s)]
*  and preventing people from coming into the country. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=143.4s)]
*  Allen, I want to step in for just a second. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  Congratulations on that many books in one lifetime and can't wait to read the latest. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=147.88s)]
*  Look, I want to jump in on what President Trump is doing. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  You just gave him credit for taking some steps. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=155.72s)]
*  I want to talk about this latest and how legally it could help, because you know there's so [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  much lawfare against him. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=161.88s)]
*  The liberals are trying to slow him down. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=163.8s)]
*  But what he's saying is before anybody else can get a foreign visa in this country, he [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=165.76s)]
*  wants the time for his administration to pause those foreign visas while they vet these students [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=169.68s)]
*  thoroughly, social media, everything. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=176.12s)]
*  What is your take on that legally? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=178.84s)]
*  Legally, it's perfectly permissible. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=180.68s)]
*  The administration has the right to determine who comes into the country. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=183.36s)]
*  Congress has some power. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=188.52s)]
*  The branch that has the least amount of power over this issue is the judiciary, which is [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=190.36s)]
*  taking all the power now. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=194.44000000000003s)]
*  And we have the right to know who comes into this country. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=197.64000000000001s)]
*  There is no First Amendment right to come into the country and preach anti-American, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=200.52s)]
*  anti-Semitic. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=205.84s)]
*  From the beginning of time, countries have deported, exiled, made decisions about who [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=207.92s)]
*  stays in the country and who doesn't. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  And what we're seeing going on on college campuses today, look, these two kids who were [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=216.24s)]
*  killed in Washington, D.C. last week, two wonderful young people, I predicted that shooting [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=220.44s)]
*  in my book The Preventive State. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=226.92s)]
*  I absolutely predicted it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=228.72s)]
*  I said based on my representation over the years of radicals, some of whom became murderers, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=230.92s)]
*  when you start protesting in a violent way, breaking windows and harassing people and [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=237.8s)]
*  shoving people, the step toward planting a bomb or getting a gun is a short step. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=245.24s)]
*  So in my book The Preventive State, I actually predicted that this would happen. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=251.76000000000002s)]
*  And it happened tragically to two young people. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=257.04s)]
*  It's going to happen again. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=260.2s)]
*  Oh, sadly. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=261.2s)]
*  The day after this happened, I was getting an honorary degree. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=262.2s)]
*  And the school, a different school, had to redouble my security and create a mechanism [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=265.4s)]
*  to escape. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=271.88s)]
*  So you see this intensifying because we know that the president, and it says it right there [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=272.88s)]
*  on our screen for viewers, is intensifying his anti-Semitism, Jewish hate fight right [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=276.35999999999996s)]
*  now. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=281.79999999999995s)]
*  But you think that people who are perpetrating, and look, if you're punching and hitting and [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=282.79999999999995s)]
*  screaming and doing all of that, not the screaming, but depending on what you're screaming, I [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=287.0s)]
*  This is not protected. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=292.76s)]
*  This is not protest, what we're watching. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=294.72s)]
*  This is violence, as you described it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=297.3s)]
*  I had on yesterday Leo Terrell, who heads the Justice Department's Task Force to Combat [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=299.04s)]
*  Anti-Semitism for the Trump administration. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=304.68s)]
*  He was in focus with me with the message, bring it on. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=307.64000000000004s)]
*  Watch. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=312.24s)]
*  Trump is going nowhere. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=313.64s)]
*  We're going to have to match them in court, Harris. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=314.64s)]
*  This is going to be a battle in the courtroom. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=316.68s)]
*  If it goes all the way to the Supreme Court, Trump is going to do that. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=318.88s)]
*  This is not academic freedom. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=322.32s)]
*  This is anti-Semitism in its purest, most hatred form, and it's being tolerated not [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=323.52s)]
*  only on universities, but throughout the country. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=329.12s)]
*  So I said this yesterday, Alan, after those words from Leo, I said, it's like these campuses [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=331.92s)]
*  are sanctuary cities and states. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=337.56s)]
*  They have become their own sanctuary areas. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=339.76s)]
*  And Leo said, yeah, you know what, the civil rights of 1964, 60, 65, that legislation, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=342.66s)]
*  that act says that they can stomp that out legally. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=349.26000000000005s)]
*  There's not a problem there. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=353.1s)]
*  But you've been and also taught on that campus for four decades. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=355.06s)]
*  What does it really take to change schools like Harvard? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=361.5s)]
*  Money? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=364.38s)]
*  Oh, it's going to take an enormous amount of effort. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=365.38s)]
*  First of all, you have to get back to meritocracy, where people are selected for faculty and [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=368.58s)]
*  student positions based on their merits, broadly defined. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=373.09999999999997s)]
*  Second, you have to eliminate all of these departments that teach intersectionality, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=376.94s)]
*  DEI, gender studies, ethnic studies. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=381.46s)]
*  These are all incubators for anti-Semitism. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=385.18s)]
*  These schools, some of these departments, like the Divinity School and the Public Health [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=388.74s)]
*  School are rotten to the core. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=392.65999999999997s)]
*  They have to be essentially monitored to make sure that they're not teaching and preaching [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=395.14000000000004s)]
*  anti-Semitism. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=400.58000000000004s)]
*  It's not only tolerating anti-Semitism. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=401.58000000000004s)]
*  It's teaching it and rewarding it. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=404.22s)]
*  And that's what's going on today on many college campuses. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=406.58000000000004s)]
*  And you cannot today be a conservative, a pro-Israel person, and expect to be given [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=409.94000000000005s)]
*  an audience under the marketplace of ideas at Harvard University and other universities. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=415.86s)]
*  So it's really important to take some action. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=421.3s)]
*  They should be targeted actions. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=423.94s)]
*  They should target the departments that are teaching this stuff. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=425.3s)]
*  They should be targeting students who, if they got a visa, would be hurting people in [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=429.46s)]
*  this country. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=435.82s)]
*  They should be more targeted and less general. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=436.98s)]
*  But it's a good beginning. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=440.34s)]
*  And I think vetting every potential applicant coming into this country is legally permissible [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=442.42s)]
*  and desirable from a moral point of view. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=448.06s)]
*  Look, I wrote down what you said in quotes. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=450.54s)]
*  Places like Harvard are incubators for anti-Semitism. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=453.21999999999997s)]
*  They're just crooking it. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=456.18s)]
*  I mean, it's disgusting. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=457.5s)]
*  In the memory of Yaron and Sarah, who you spoke of, who died in Washington, D.C., at [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=459.82s)]
*  the Capitol Museum, it's only been a week. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgPYUQrafdg&t=463.86s)]
