# Hamas expected to release 10 more hostages as cease-fire holds
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k)
*  Fox News alert. Take a look. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=0.0s)]
*  Looks like smoke rising over Gaza, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  despite the temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=5.8s)]
*  set to continue through tomorrow. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=9.48s)]
*  We're going to verify exactly what's happening right now. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=11.08s)]
*  But meantime, today we are expecting Hamas [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=13.72s)]
*  to release 10 more hostages. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=16.04s)]
*  You're watching Fox and Friends First [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=18.48s)]
*  here on a Tuesday morning on Todd Fire. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=19.68s)]
*  And I'm Carly Schimke. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  51 people held by Hamas are now back in Israel. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  After the terror group released 11 more women [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=25.68s)]
*  and children yesterday. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=28.44s)]
*  They were airlifted to a hospital in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=30.44s)]
*  And that's where we find Trey Yanks this morning. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=32.800000000000004s)]
*  Trey, that smoke plume could change things, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=35.4s)]
*  but right now we just don't know what it is [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=37.96s)]
*  or what's going on. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=41.0s)]
*  Yeah, Todd, Carly, good morning. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=45.08s)]
*  It is day five of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=46.32s)]
*  We're looking at those live images there [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=49.5s)]
*  of the Gaza border with black smoke rising [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  from inside the strip. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=53.96s)]
*  It could be an indication there was a ceasefire violation. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=55.6s)]
*  It could be a tactic for Israelis [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=58.199999999999996s)]
*  to cover their forces as they reposition. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=60.08s)]
*  We simply don't know at this point, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=62.599999999999994s)]
*  but we are looking into it at this hour. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  It comes after 11 more hostages were freed overnight [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=66.39999999999999s)]
*  as part of this larger ceasefire deal. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  They were flown here to the Ichelov Hospital [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=72.44s)]
*  in the center part of Tel Aviv, nine of them children. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=74.6s)]
*  And we know that they are from the same small community [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=78.08s)]
*  of Neroz taken into Gaza on October 7th. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=80.6s)]
*  All of them have fathers that are being held inside Gaza. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=84.28s)]
*  Israeli officials are hopeful that 10 additional hostages [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=87.84s)]
*  will be released tonight as part of the ceasefire [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=90.92s)]
*  that has been extended for two additional days. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  It's these families reuniting that stands out [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=95.84s)]
*  over the past week. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=97.92s)]
*  You look at this video here of the Broz family [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=99.16s)]
*  that was reunited over the weekend, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=102.04s)]
*  these kids meeting their dog for the first time [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=103.56s)]
*  in more than 50 days. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=105.88s)]
*  You can see the joy on their faces. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  We also continue to follow developments from inside Gaza, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=109.0s)]
*  where right now Palestinians are using the lull and fighting [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=111.80000000000001s)]
*  to gather supplies and clean water. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=114.72s)]
*  At this water station in Hanunis, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=117.0s)]
*  Gazans fill up large jugs, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=118.56s)]
*  unsure about when they'll have the next opportunity to do so. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=120.4s)]
*  And we should note this is the longest conflict [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=123.92s)]
*  in the history between Israel and Gaza. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=126.04s)]
*  The closest in length was 51 days back in 2014, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=128.64s)]
*  but this clearly still developing [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=132.44s)]
*  with hostages still held inside Gaza [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=134.28s)]
*  and the fighting expected to continue later this week. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=136.68s)]
*  And Trey, so notable that you said that all the children [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=139.64s)]
*  that were released yesterday have fathers still inside Gaza, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=141.96s)]
*  which could have been done by some cruel design. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=145.8s)]
*  And the other thing that's coming to light now [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=148.32000000000002s)]
*  that is of concern is that some of the hostages [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=150.8s)]
*  aren't being held by Hamas, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=153.36s)]
*  they're being held by other terror groups. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=155.36s)]
*  And that raises a lot of questions on what happens to them. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=157.44s)]
*  Could they possibly ever be part of a hostage negotiation [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=161.24s)]
*  between Hamas and Israel if they're being held [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=165.32000000000002s)]
*  by another group like the Palestinian Islamic Jihad? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=168.36s)]
*  It's a great question. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=172.6s)]
*  And look, there are reports that indicate [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=174.88s)]
*  up to 40 hostages being held inside Gaza [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=176.76s)]
*  aren't actually being held by Hamas, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=179.6s)]
*  the group that still controls part of the strip. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=181.4s)]
*  There are other organizations like Islamic Jihad, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=183.92s)]
*  DFLP, PFLP, smaller criminal organizations [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=186.28s)]
*  that are families inside Gaza. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=189.64s)]
*  And they are reportedly holding some of the hostages. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=192.32s)]
*  It further complicates these negotiations [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=194.51999999999998s)]
*  because the reality is Hamas may not be able to identify [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=196.84s)]
*  where they are being held. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=199.48s)]
*  And thus they can't get them and release them [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=201.2s)]
*  as part of a larger deal that's being negotiated [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  by the Qataris or the Egyptians. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=205.48s)]
*  And so as we look forward into this, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=207.88s)]
*  there could be a few more days of ceasefire. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=209.84s)]
*  Even this extension could be extended. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=211.72s)]
*  But we will get to a point where the fighting [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=213.96s)]
*  is expected to resume. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=215.88s)]
*  Israeli forces say they are preparing for weeks of battle [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=217.24s)]
*  inside Gaza as they push deeper into the strip [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=220.4s)]
*  and continue to go after Hamas leadership. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=223.12s)]
*  Tre, thanks a lot for us in Tel Aviv. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=225.28s)]
*  Tre, thank you so much. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJDtlOGe3k&t=227.07999999999998s)]
