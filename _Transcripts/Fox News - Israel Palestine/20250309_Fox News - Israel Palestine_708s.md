# 'PROBABLY THE END OF THE WORLD': Trump warns of dangers posed by nuclear weapons
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [March 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM)
*  Let me go back to what happened in the Oval Office the other day. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=0.0s)]
*  I call it a smackdown of Zelensky. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=4.44s)]
*  It looked really rough, but then again, at the end of the day, you may have your deal [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=8.0s)]
*  back. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=12.68s)]
*  So was that all the art of the deal? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=13.68s)]
*  What specifically ticked you off? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=14.9s)]
*  Well, you know, he was able to, it was like taking candy from a baby, what he did. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  He's a smart guy, and he's a tough guy. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=24.96s)]
*  And he took money out of this country under Biden like candy from a baby. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=28.92s)]
*  It was so easy, with that same attitude. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=37.32s)]
*  And I just don't think he's grateful. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=41.72s)]
*  We gave him, in my opinion, $350 billion. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=44.68s)]
*  Europe is in for $100 billion. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=48.64s)]
*  We gave him $350 billion, and he's talking about the fact that they have fought and they [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=51.2s)]
*  have. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=55.72s)]
*  There's a bravery, because somebody has to use the weapons. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=56.72s)]
*  Without those weapons, don't forget, I was the one that gave him the javelins that was [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=58.42s)]
*  able to knock down all the ties. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=62.660000000000004s)]
*  Obama gave nothing. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=64.42s)]
*  Look, if I were president, that would have never happened. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=66.02000000000001s)]
*  You wouldn't have had Russia going into Ukraine. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=69.02000000000001s)]
*  You wouldn't have had the whole situation with Hamas and October 7th. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=71.78s)]
*  It would have never happened because Iran was broke. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=76.5s)]
*  They had no money. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=79.42s)]
*  They weren't giving it to Hamas or Hezbollah, anybody else. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=80.42s)]
*  You would have never had the worst evacuation anyone's ever seen, which is Afghanistan, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=83.4s)]
*  which was the most embarrassing day in the history of our country. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=89.36s)]
*  And you know what else? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=92.0s)]
*  You wouldn't have had inflation. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=93.64s)]
*  We had record-setting inflation under Biden. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=95.48s)]
*  It was a killer. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=97.72s)]
*  And it's one of the reasons I won the election. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=98.72s)]
*  But you may get it again with these tariffs, right? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=101.2s)]
*  You may get it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  I mean, one CEO said to me, my input costs have already started to go up. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  I'm going to have to raise prices. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=107.16000000000001s)]
*  In the meantime, guess what? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  the last three, four days at good levels. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=111.56s)]
*  I mean, you know, when you add interest rates, you're talking about it's gone down. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  We've been â€” I've been saying, let's get interest rates down. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  You know, nobody ever gets rich when the interest rates are high because people can't borrow [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=123.88s)]
*  money. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=129.0s)]
*  Interest rates are going down. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=130.0s)]
*  You know what else is going down? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=131.0s)]
*  What have I been trying to get down? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=132.56s)]
*  Energy. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=134.4s)]
*  Energy is going down. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=135.98000000000002s)]
*  I'd love to see energy go down. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=137.84s)]
*  You know, energy is really what caused it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=140.0s)]
*  They screwed up my energy. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=141.72s)]
*  I had the most energy, and they screwed it up. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=142.8s)]
*  Then they went back to it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=145.72s)]
*  It was going through the roof. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=147.16s)]
*  They went back to some drilling. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=148.36s)]
*  But it was gone. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=151.4s)]
*  It was hopeless. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=152.56s)]
*  It was lost. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=153.56s)]
*  But energy's gone down, and interest rates have gone up over the last week. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=154.56s)]
*  That's a big thing. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=158.64000000000001s)]
*  I love that. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  Do you expect Zelensky to come back? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  Do you expect to do that rare earth minerals deal? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=161.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=164.24s)]
*  I think it'll happen. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=165.24s)]
*  Are you sure there's the content that you think there is there? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=166.24s)]
*  Some people were questioning if, in fact, there is the titanium and the lithium, all [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=169.12s)]
*  those batteries, the rare earth minerals. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=174.76s)]
*  You think it is rich with those things? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=176.51999999999998s)]
*  Well, I do. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=178.48s)]
*  I do. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=179.48s)]
*  I mean, I've had it checked. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=180.48s)]
*  I've had it checked. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=181.48s)]
*  It's very valuable. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=182.48s)]
*  But with all that being said, Biden should have never put up $350 billion. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=183.48s)]
*  He should have equalized with Europe. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=189.39999999999998s)]
*  All he had to do is say, you've got to stay even with us. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=191.0s)]
*  They're in for $100 billion. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=193.88s)]
*  We're in for $350 billion. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=194.88s)]
*  How does that? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=197.48s)]
*  We have an ocean in between us, right? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=198.92s)]
*  We're not in the danger that they are. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=199.92s)]
*  They are in much greater danger, if you call it danger. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=201.95999999999998s)]
*  He should have never done that. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=206.0s)]
*  You know the other thing with Europe that bothers me? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=207.28s)]
*  They've given Russia more money, by far, for buying their oil than they put into Ukraine. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=210.32s)]
*  So they're paying all this money to Russia, and we're in there for $350 billion. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=218.56s)]
*  Biden should have never done that. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=224.56s)]
*  I spoke with the president of Poland the other day. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=225.83999999999997s)]
*  President Duda has great respect for you. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=229.08s)]
*  And I said to him, you know, what if the U.S. walks away and stays away? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=231.72s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=236.96s)]
*  Without the United States, do you believe that Europe is capable of offering meaningful [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=238.32s)]
*  security to Ukraine? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=244.4s)]
*  I would like to believe it, but experience to date shows that this has not been the case. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=246.64s)]
*  The entire history so far of the last three years of the war shows that without American [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=253.84s)]
*  support, Ukraine will not survive. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=260.04s)]
*  Are you comfortable with that? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=262.68s)]
*  The fact that you walked away and Ukraine may not survive? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=264.32s)]
*  Well, it may not survive anyway, but, you know, we have some weaknesses with Russia. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=267.6s)]
*  You know, it takes two. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=274.96s)]
*  Look, it was not going to happen, that war, and it happened. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=276.96s)]
*  So now we're stuck with this mess. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=280.56s)]
*  Think of what he stuck me with. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=282.94s)]
*  Open borders where we have 21 million people came into our country, many of whom should [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=284.96s)]
*  not be here. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=288.71999999999997s)]
*  Many are criminals. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=289.71999999999997s)]
*  Many, many are criminals. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=290.71999999999997s)]
*  Many murderers. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=291.88s)]
*  Murderers. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=292.88s)]
*  Drug dealers. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=293.88s)]
*  Drug lords. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=294.88s)]
*  We got that. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=295.88s)]
*  We have the whole mess with Israel on October 7th. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=298.97999999999996s)]
*  We have all of the ramifications from the worst and dumbest withdrawal in history. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=302.94s)]
*  Both Ukraine and Israel were both attacked by aggressors. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=309.08s)]
*  Is America treating both countries similarly? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=313.21999999999997s)]
*  Are they treating the aggressors similarly? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=315.64s)]
*  I think so. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=320.08s)]
*  Look, they're very different. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=321.08s)]
*  Are you favoring one over the other? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=322.08s)]
*  They're very different places. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=323.08s)]
*  OK, very, very different. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=324.08s)]
*  You're talking about different levels of power. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=325.46s)]
*  You're talking about different parts of the world. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=328.0s)]
*  The Middle East has been under attack forever. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=331.64s)]
*  It's been... [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=333.88s)]
*  You look. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=334.88s)]
*  When wasn't it under attack? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=336.09999999999997s)]
*  And then we came along and did the Abraham Accords, which was unheard of. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=338.47999999999996s)]
*  Have you been as tough on Russia as you've been on Hamas? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=342.32s)]
*  I mean, what do you want to say to critics? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=345.35999999999996s)]
*  Well, I've been much tougher, because I haven't done to Hamas. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=347.32s)]
*  That's been Israel that has to do to Hamas. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  But Israel does tell me what's going on. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=352.88s)]
*  I think I've been very tough to Russia, tougher than anybody's ever been to Russia, if you [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=356.08s)]
*  think about it. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=361.67999999999995s)]
*  First of all, we had the Russia, Russia, Russia hooks, which was a very bad thing. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=362.67999999999995s)]
*  It could have led to a war. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=367.72s)]
*  And that was started by Schiff and all these lowlifes. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=369.44s)]
*  I know. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=371.88s)]
*  They're total lowlifes. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=372.88s)]
*  And it was a fake deal, the 51 intelligence agencies. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=375.20000000000005s)]
*  It was... [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=378.84000000000003s)]
*  I took all their passes away. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=379.84000000000003s)]
*  They can't participate anymore. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=381.16s)]
*  These guys know it came from Hunter Biden's laptop from hell, which came from his bathroom [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=383.64000000000004s)]
*  and or his bedroom. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=390.20000000000005s)]
*  OK, not a pretty sight. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=391.76000000000005s)]
*  But this was a Hunter Biden thing. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=393.88s)]
*  They said it was from Russia. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=395.32s)]
*  No, I've been I've been very tough. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=396.88s)]
*  Remember this. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=400.28s)]
*  I'm the one that stopped the Russian pipeline, Nord Stream 2. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=401.28s)]
*  I stopped it. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=405.23999999999995s)]
*  Biden came in and he approved it. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=406.32s)]
*  I'm the one that put sanctions on Russia. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=408.91999999999996s)]
*  I'm the one that gave the javelins against Russia. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=411.15999999999997s)]
*  No, I've been very tough, but I got along well with Putin. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=413.91999999999996s)]
*  And because I got along well, oh, they say, oh, he's so nobody's ever been. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=417.79999999999995s)]
*  Putin would be the first to say it. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=422.52s)]
*  Nobody's been tougher than Trump. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=424.28000000000003s)]
*  And Biden hasn't been tough. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=426.44s)]
*  Biden's done nothing. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=428.44s)]
*  He was a weak, pathetic man. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=429.44s)]
*  So is there anything else you want to say to the critics who say you chose a side in [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=431.68s)]
*  the Ukraine-Russia story, and that's Russia, because, you know, you called Zelensky a dictator [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=436.40000000000003s)]
*  and you had the fight. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=441.6s)]
*  Nobody has been tougher on Russia than Donald Trump. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=445.28000000000003s)]
*  Nobody. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=449.04s)]
*  And they know that. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=450.24s)]
*  They know that. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=451.24s)]
*  Just look at the things I just told you. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=452.24s)]
*  The pipeline, I stopped it. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=453.72s)]
*  The biggest job they've ever done was the pipeline, Nord Stream 2. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=456.36s)]
*  Nobody ever heard of it until I came along. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=459.6s)]
*  They were building it happily. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=461.08000000000004s)]
*  They were going to supply Germany and everybody else all over Europe. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=462.08000000000004s)]
*  And what did I do? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=466.32000000000005s)]
*  I stopped it. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=467.6s)]
*  The biggest economic job they've ever had, I stopped it. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=469.5s)]
*  Biden got in. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=472.72s)]
*  On the second day, he approved it. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=474.76000000000005s)]
*  He said, let it go forward. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=476.64000000000004s)]
*  It was totally stopped. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=478.24s)]
*  Just that one thing alone tells you everything. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=480.08000000000004s)]
*  No, I was tough. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=482.68s)]
*  At the same time, I got along with Putin. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=483.68s)]
*  I got along with Kim Jong-un. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=488.0s)]
*  I got along with President Xi. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=489.76s)]
*  But nobody was tougher, like, on China than I was. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=492.44s)]
*  And then there are reports now that Russia says it will help the United States negotiate [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=495.24s)]
*  a nuclear deal with Iran. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=500.03999999999996s)]
*  What kind of a deal with Iran do you want to do? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=502.12s)]
*  You said they cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=504.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=506.24s)]
*  Well, there are two ways Iran can be handled, militarily or you make a deal. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=507.24s)]
*  I would prefer to make a deal, because I'm not looking to hurt Iran. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=511.56s)]
*  They're great people. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=514.84s)]
*  I know so many Iranians from this country. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=515.96s)]
*  Well, not the leadership. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=518.52s)]
*  No, not the leadership. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=519.52s)]
*  The people. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=520.52s)]
*  No, they're very evil people. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=521.52s)]
*  No, but the people of Iran are great people. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=522.52s)]
*  But they had a tough regime, and they'd meet and they'd be shot in the streets. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=526.32s)]
*  I mean, it was a tough deal. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=530.88s)]
*  But I would rather negotiate a deal. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=534.2s)]
*  I'm not sure that everybody agrees with me, but we can make a deal that would be just [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=537.36s)]
*  as good as if you won militarily. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=541.48s)]
*  But the time is happening now. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=546.0400000000001s)]
*  The time is coming up. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=547.5600000000001s)]
*  Something's going to happen one way or the other. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=549.0400000000001s)]
*  I hope that Iran, and I've written them a letter saying, I hope you're going to negotiate, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=550.7600000000001s)]
*  because if we have to go in militarily, it's going to be a terrible thing for them. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=556.48s)]
*  You wrote a letter to the Khomeini? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=561.4000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=563.44s)]
*  When did you send the letter? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=564.44s)]
*  Yesterday. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=566.0799999999999s)]
*  And you said you'd better negotiate, or we want you to negotiate? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=567.0799999999999s)]
*  No, I didn't say you'd better. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=569.48s)]
*  I said, I hope you're going to negotiate, because it's going to be a lot better for [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=570.48s)]
*  Iran. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=573.7199999999999s)]
*  And I think they want to get that letter. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=575.56s)]
*  The other alternative is we have to do something, because you can't let them have a nuclear [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=578.64s)]
*  weapon. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=582.12s)]
*  You said you wanted to do the Golden Dome. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=583.12s)]
*  You've got a lot of ideas for America. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=585.12s)]
*  But then earlier you said you wanted to cut a trillion dollars in defense spending, right? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=587.36s)]
*  I didn't say I was going to do it. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=591.3199999999999s)]
*  You're not going to. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=592.3199999999999s)]
*  So I was like, which is it? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=593.3199999999999s)]
*  Are you cutting defense spending, or are you building a sub? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=594.3199999999999s)]
*  I said I never said defense spending. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=595.4000000000001s)]
*  OK, because I think you were talking about denuclearization. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=597.4000000000001s)]
*  Correct. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=599.4000000000001s)]
*  And that's where the cutting of the spending came in. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=600.4000000000001s)]
*  I never said cut. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=602.72s)]
*  Not in these days. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=604.6800000000001s)]
*  I'd love to cut defense spending, but not now, because you have China, you have Russia, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=605.6800000000001s)]
*  you have a lot of problems out there. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=610.6800000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=613.24s)]
*  In fact... [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=614.24s)]
*  No, what I have said is we spend a lot of money on nuclear missiles, nuclear weapons. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=615.24s)]
*  The level of destruction is beyond anything you can even imagine. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=621.44s)]
*  It's just bad that everybody has to spend all this money on something that if it's used, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=624.6800000000001s)]
*  it's probably the end of the world. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=629.72s)]
*  Wow. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=631.72s)]
*  What's the say to that? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=632.72s)]
*  You know, when I listen to these climate lunatics and they talk about global warming, and they [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=635.44s)]
*  say the ocean's going to rise one-eighth of an inch in the next 300 years, and you know... [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=642.2s)]
*  And nobody ever talks about nuclear weapons or some of the other things. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=649.52s)]
*  The nuclear weapons in particular right now. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=653.64s)]
*  And they talk about the climate. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=656.84s)]
*  And they talk about the dangers of the climate. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=660.2s)]
*  But they don't talk about the dangers of a nuclear weapon, which could happen tomorrow. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=663.08s)]
*  They say in 300 years, I watched Biden for years say the existential threat. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=666.96s)]
*  He loved the term, existential threat. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=674.0s)]
*  Our greatest existential threat is from the climate. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=677.32s)]
*  I said no. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=681.64s)]
*  The greatest is sitting in shelves in various countries called nuclear weapons that are [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=683.04s)]
*  big monsters that can blow your heads off for miles and miles and miles. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=687.84s)]
*  And they never mention that. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoaWIH7MXM&t=693.84s)]
