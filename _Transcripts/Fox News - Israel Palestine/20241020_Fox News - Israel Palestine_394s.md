# Pompeo warns this 'bad policy' has put 'America at risk'
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM)
*  He has been called a war criminal, lambasted by those pro-Palestinian protesters in our [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=0.0s)]
*  country and hundreds of thousands of demonstrators in his own. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=5.22s)]
*  But you know, through it all, all the criticism and the attacks, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=8.58s)]
*  has stood firm, unwavered in his determination to protect his nation, forged for the Jewish [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=13.74s)]
*  people from the Holocaust. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=19.98s)]
*  What comes next? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=22.2s)]
*  Matt Pompeo is with us, former Secretary of State, former director of the CIA, also a [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=23.2s)]
*  Fox News contributor. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=27.88s)]
*  Next, Mr. Secretary of State, the decapitating of Hezbollah leaders in those astounding attacks [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=29.9s)]
*  in Lebanon, Sinwar taken out. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=35.42s)]
*  Do you see this as Netanyahu's Churchill moment, where he even resisted the Biden administration, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=38.06s)]
*  telling him, don't go into Rafa, and if he listened, Sinwar would potentially still be [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=44.339999999999996s)]
*  alive? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=49.379999999999995s)]
*  Well, Eric, there's no doubt about it. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=50.379999999999995s)]
*  If the Israelis had followed the guidance, really the demands and the threats from the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=54.22s)]
*  United States of America, the Hezbollah leadership, the Hamas leadership, political leadership, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=58.14s)]
*  Haniyeh was negotiating for the Hamas Iranian terrorists, they'd all still be alive and [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=63.300000000000004s)]
*  the threat on Israel and the United States of America would still be out there. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=69.82000000000001s)]
*  So good on the Israelis from doing what was necessary. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=72.98s)]
*  But so far, Eric, we've only got what's necessary. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=76.9s)]
*  It is not sufficient. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=78.78s)]
*  We need to get the hostages back. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=79.78s)]
*  None of us should forget that there are still Americans that are held hostage, US citizens. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=82.38s)]
*  I pray they are all still alive, as with all of the hostages. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=86.89999999999999s)]
*  And the only way to get that is to have the leadership in Iran determine that the costs [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=90.74s)]
*  of continuing this conflict are too high. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=94.66s)]
*  No matter how many terrorists are taken out on the ground in Gaza or in Syria or in Yemen, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=97.3s)]
*  as long as in Tehran, the leadership believes that it can get away with this, that it can [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=103.14s)]
*  kill Americans, it can kill Israelis, it can conduct terror campaigns of the most barbaric [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=106.78s)]
*  proportion, and there'll be no costs imposed on the regime itself. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=111.78s)]
*  This conflict will continue. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=115.48s)]
*  We won't get the hostages home, and Israel will be insecure. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=116.8s)]
*  Do you think that the Iranians in Tehran, do you think they're recalculating at all, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=120.72s)]
*  or do they see that they can potentially get away with this with all their terror support? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=125.48s)]
*  Well, I think they've learned a lot, Eric. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  I think they've learned, one, that their missile system is wholly ineffectual against the amazing [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=133.08s)]
*  defenses that, frankly, Israel, with the support of the US military, has provided to Israel. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=137.12s)]
*  They've fired the largest ballistic missile attack in the history of the world and did [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=143.16s)]
*  relatively little damage inside of Israel, so I think they're rethinking their capacity [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=147.2s)]
*  to inflict pain directly from Iran, but make no mistake about it, their core intention, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  the wiping Israel from the face of the earth and then following that by the elimination [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=157.44s)]
*  of the United States of America. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=161.76s)]
*  That statement they have made for many, many years has not been deterred, has not been [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=163.72s)]
*  changed, and the regime is intent on accomplishing that. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=167.32s)]
*  And to date, all the Biden administration has done is it says, we fear escalation, we're [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=171.68s)]
*  happy to negotiate with you to try and get you to stop your nuclear program, but the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=175.2s)]
*  Iranians have continued to enrich, to build out that program, at enormous risk to the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=179.08s)]
*  United States of America, and they now have almost $30 billion with which to do that because [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=183.68s)]
*  the Biden administration has refused to enforce the sanctions that were put in place during [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=188.96s)]
*  the Trump years. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=194.0s)]
*  Has that just emboldened the Iranians and the regime to continue its terror ways? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=195.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's emboldened them as a practitioners matter. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=201.0s)]
*  We've seen that, right? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=204.48s)]
*  October 7th is a direct result of them feeling like the U.S. wouldn't respond. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=205.48s)]
*  The hundreds of rockets that have rained in from the north, keeping the Israelis from [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=209.68s)]
*  going back to their homes in the northern part of Israel, that's just they're feeling [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=213.6s)]
*  free to go do that, and their continuation of their nuclear program, same thing. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=217.04s)]
*  They're building, they perceive little risk, there's no reason for the Iranians to change [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=222.24s)]
*  U.S. unapologetic defense of America and helping Israel defend itself as well. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=227.28s)]
*  Israel and the Prime Minister and Defense Minister Galant have said that the Israelis [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=232.88s)]
*  will respond to those recent Iranian attacks. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=236.64s)]
*  Do you think they will go after the nuclear program? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=239.56s)]
*  Do you think they will go after the oil fields? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=241.52s)]
*  Or has there been some deal cut with the Biden administration to try and not do that because [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=243.6s)]
*  of the election? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=249.4s)]
*  I don't think there's any doubt that the Israelis are under enormous pressure from the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=250.4s)]
*  United States. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=256.08s)]
*  We only need to believe some of the reporting we've seen that the Americans have actually [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=257.08s)]
*  leaked Israeli actions. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=261.28s)]
*  American intelligence talking about what Israel might do. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  I don't know what targets they'll go for. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=267.2s)]
*  I don't know how Israel will decide to respond, but I am convinced of this. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=268.52s)]
*  The Israelis understand this as an existential threat to their nation. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=272.4s)]
*  1948 is the creation of the state, and the adversaries in Iran want that to go away. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=277.03999999999996s)]
*  They're going to stay at this and do the necessary to protect and defend themselves, and they [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=284.36s)]
*  should be doing it. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=287.28000000000003s)]
*  Without Vice President Harris talking about this being a potential genocide in Gaza, that's [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=288.76000000000005s)]
*  just fundamentally indecent and misunderstands who it was. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=293.16s)]
*  It was the Iranians that caused all of the grief for the innocent civilians in Gaza. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=296.64000000000004s)]
*  Until there is a resolution that gets security for them and for the globe, the Gulf State [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=303.28000000000003s)]
*  countries too are going to see themselves as needing to hedge because the United States [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=309.52s)]
*  has simply refused to support its ally in the region. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=313.72s)]
*  And finally, the Vice President is elected as president. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=316.4s)]
*  Do you fear or do you worry about what type of message that could send to Tehran, especially [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=319.4s)]
*  people like you? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=324.24s)]
*  John Bolton, Brian Hook, the former president, who apparently are under an assassination [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=325.52s)]
*  plot by Tehran? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=330.16s)]
*  Yeah, Erica, it's all green light. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=332.36s)]
*  She will continue to do precisely what Barack Obama did, what President Biden has done, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=336.28s)]
*  and what she's done as the vice president to see the group that is inside Iran as moderates, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=340.47999999999996s)]
*  as someone that you can negotiate with instead of a nation that only understands power and [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=346.28s)]
*  risk to starve them, to put pressure on the regime, starve the regime, starve its power, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=350.15999999999997s)]
*  and create a model which builds the deterrence that we had for four years. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=355.68s)]
*  Eric, you talk about assassination attempts here inside the United States. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=360.64s)]
*  The Biden administration has done far too little to convince the Iranians to stop not [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=364.15999999999997s)]
*  just doing it, but threatening to do it against former senior American officials and, frankly, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=368.4s)]
*  non-government officials, too, here in the United States. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=373.12s)]
*  It's been a bad policy. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=375.88s)]
*  It's put America at risk. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=376.88s)]
*  And I am very hopeful that we will turn the page in January and go back to a model which [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=377.88s)]
*  can actually protect the American people. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=382.32s)]
*  America at Risk by Iran says the former secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=384.91999999999996s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, thank you for joining us on this Sunday. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=389.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=392.36s)]
*  It's been really good to see you. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0ccyKWqUM&t=393.36s)]
