# Military expert reveals the ‘name of the game’ to defeat Hamas in the next four years
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA)
*  Retired Brigadier General Rob Spohling with us right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=0.0s)]
*  General, we talk a lot about, and we did, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  when Syria was ruled by Assad, and now, of course, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=6.0s)]
*  it's a whole new government taking over. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=8.16s)]
*  A lot of people are hopeful [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=9.44s)]
*  that it's not gonna be a devil we don't know. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=11.6s)]
*  It's not a devil at all. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=13.68s)]
*  We knew the one that was there, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=15.4s)]
*  and this is going to be very different. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=16.84s)]
*  But I'm old enough to remember, General, as are you, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=18.6s)]
*  there was great hope, at least in Iran, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=20.84s)]
*  after the Shah of Iran left, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=23.36s)]
*  that the Atoll committee would add order and structure, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=24.96s)]
*  and of course, it was anything but. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=29.04s)]
*  So what do you see happening now? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=31.32s)]
*  Well, I don't believe that we're gonna see [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=34.4s)]
*  some great civilizations arise out of Syria. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=37.36s)]
*  I think the bigger lesson to learn here [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=41.160000000000004s)]
*  is the incredible weakening of Iran [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=43.6s)]
*  just since the election, our election, in early November, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=46.32s)]
*  and you just see Iran starting to contract [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=51.6s)]
*  in terms of its ability. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=55.92s)]
*  Some of this has to do with what the IDF has done, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=57.68s)]
*  but a lot of it has to do just with the changing nature [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=60.84s)]
*  of the overall globe since the election. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=64.4s)]
*  So General, the issue becomes what now, right? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=68.0s)]
*  I mean, we've already had Hezbollah's chief on the wires [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=70.4s)]
*  saying that we hope the new rulers of Syria [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=73.32s)]
*  will see Israel as an enemy and not normalize ties with it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=75.84s)]
*  So everyone is trying to get their PR points in. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=79.88s)]
*  Where do you see this going? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=82.72s)]
*  Well, you know, I think what you're gonna see [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=85.2s)]
*  is a strong support of Israel, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=88.2s)]
*  and more importantly, we're gonna see a lot of our adversaries [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=89.8s)]
*  start to rock back on their heels. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  You're already starting to see Russia clear out of Syria. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  You're seeing the withering of Iran, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=97.64s)]
*  and I think you're gonna start to see China [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=100.12s)]
*  begin to do some rechecking [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=102.24s)]
*  of some of the things that they've done. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=104.08s)]
*  And what this does is it gives us an ability [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=105.72s)]
*  to start focusing here on the homeland. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=108.12s)]
*  Digital infrastructure, you know, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=110.32s)]
*  the fact that we have drones flying around [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=111.64s)]
*  that people are worried about. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=113.96s)]
*  I'm not as concerned about that, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=115.16s)]
*  but I am concerned about the ability to, you know, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=116.72s)]
*  in the future, detect and track those types of things. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=120.08s)]
*  So building on our energy supply, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=123.56s)]
*  building on our manufacturing, reshoring manufacturing [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=126.48s)]
*  here in the United States, protecting the homeland, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=129.96s)]
*  I think that's gonna be the name of the game [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=131.92s)]
*  for the next four years. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=134.52s)]
*  And I think it's a very positive development [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=135.4s)]
*  what's happening in the Middle East. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=137.92s)]
*  You know, General, if I can talk about [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=139.88s)]
*  the next four to five weeks, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=141.28s)]
*  Donald Trump has already warned Hamas, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=142.76s)]
*  you better release all of these hostages, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=145.68s)]
*  you gotta, it's gonna be hell to pay. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=147.36s)]
*  Let's say they don't do that, then what? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=149.24s)]
*  Well, first of all, I think the IDF [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=154.4s)]
*  has clearly established their supremacy in the region. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=156.24s)]
*  They've dealt with Hamas, they've dealt with Hezbollah [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=159.0s)]
*  to the extent that they need more support. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=162.48000000000002s)]
*  You're gonna see weapons coming in to support them [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=165.56s)]
*  and, you know, capabilities if they need it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=169.28s)]
*  But my sense is, you know, where the IDF is now [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=171.8s)]
*  with what they've done, and given the fact [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=175.12s)]
*  the Biden administration has really, you know, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=177.72s)]
*  kind of shortchanged them with regard [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=179.64000000000001s)]
*  to resources and material, I think that's going to change. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=181.84s)]
*  And I think, again, that's gonna give us more time [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=185.12s)]
*  to focus on domestic issues, which I think are, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=188.12s)]
*  from a national security perspective, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=191.12s)]
*  are much more serious right now. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=193.0s)]
*  You know, if I can switch to Ukraine, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=195.44s)]
*  but there is a method, my man is here, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=197.16000000000003s)]
*  because if you think that Vladimir Putin [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=198.76000000000002s)]
*  has just lost a port in Syria that he had, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=200.20000000000002s)]
*  and he's down to really Crimea right now [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=203.28s)]
*  and the importance of that for him in Europe, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=205.36s)]
*  would it push him to resolve this long war in Ukraine [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=209.08s)]
*  with Donald Trump or do just the opposite? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=213.8s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=216.6s)]
*  Well, I think it will, and more importantly, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=218.36s)]
*  I think the president now can turn to China and say, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=220.2s)]
*  look, you keep supporting the Russians [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=222.84s)]
*  and we're gonna basically turn your ships around [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=225.24s)]
*  at our ports. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=227.48s)]
*  And so I think, given the fact that the president has stated [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=228.32s)]
*  that he wants to end that war, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=232.08s)]
*  and quite frankly, Neil, what I've been saying [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=233.48000000000002s)]
*  from the very beginning is we don't need to seek a victory [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=236.84s)]
*  for Ukraine, what we need to seek is a ceasefire. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=240.04000000000002s)]
*  I think the Russians and Putin are gonna be more [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=243.32000000000002s)]
*  than ecstatic to figure out how we get to a cessation [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=246.44s)]
*  of hostilities, maybe not peace, but as you know, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=250.52s)]
*  we're still at war on the Korean Peninsula, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=254.16000000000003s)]
*  but we're not fighting, that's the key piece. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=256.84000000000003s)]
*  All right, General, thank you very much. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=259.28000000000003s)]
*  We're gonna take a quick break here, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=261.6s)]
*  but I wanna alert you to something happened [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=262.64s)]
*  on the White House. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WelNtVUCorA&t=263.96s)]
