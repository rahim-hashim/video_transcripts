# 13 Hamas hostages back in Israel, IDF confirms
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw)
*  The first groups of hostages being released by Hamas nearly 50 days after they were captured [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=0.0s)]
*  in that barbaric October 7th terror attack that killed over 1,200 people. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=7.44s)]
*  Thirteen Israelis were freed and the IDF confirms they are back in Israel. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=12.8s)]
*  Along with the 10 Thai hostages and one Filipino national, they were released separately under [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  a separate deal. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=23.48s)]
*  Total of 50 Israelis are expected to be freed over the next four days as part of the ceasefire [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=25.12s)]
*  deal that was arranged in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=29.4s)]
*  We're getting new videos showing a convoy of Red Cross ambulances carrying those hostages [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  out of Gaza. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=40.0s)]
*  You see it there. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=41.0s)]
*  But the uplifting sight of their captivity ending comes as American hostages are still [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=42.0s)]
*  being held in Gaza. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=47.0s)]
*  That includes Abigail Adan. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=48.84s)]
*  She turns four years old today. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=51.2s)]
*  They're not expected to be included in today's release. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=53.64s)]
*  We remain hopeful that they will in the future. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=56.36s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, is monitoring the situation as [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=59.68s)]
*  this fragile ceasefire deal with Hamas unfolds. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=63.28s)]
*  Hello, everyone. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=66.08s)]
*  Welcome to a special edition of Outnumbered. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=67.76s)]
*  I'm Kayleigh McEnany and joining me today, Fox News contributor Tammy Bruce, director [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=69.24s)]
*  of the Tech Policy Center at the Heritage Foundation, Kara Frederick, Restoring America [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=74.28s)]
*  editor for The Washington Examiner, Kayleigh McGee White, and Fox News contributor and [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=78.92s)]
*  columnist for The Messenger, Joe Concha. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=83.2s)]
*  Let's go straight to Trey Yanks live at Hatzurim Air Base in southern Israel with the latest [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=86.55999999999999s)]
*  Trey. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=91.24s)]
*  Hey, Kayleigh, good afternoon. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  We do expect those hostages to be brought here to the Hatzurim Air Base in southern [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=95.16s)]
*  Israel. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=100.36s)]
*  We can now confirm they are in Israeli territory. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=101.36s)]
*  And now we should change our wording. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=104.52s)]
*  They are no longer hostages. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=106.91999999999999s)]
*  They are finally home. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=108.32s)]
*  These 13 Israelis have gone through 49 days of hell, truly. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=109.75999999999999s)]
*  And the entire population of Israel breathing a sigh of relief at this moment tonight, as [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=114.96s)]
*  we understand, according to the Israeli Defense Forces, they are accompanying these hostages, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=120.83999999999999s)]
*  special forces and also Shin Bet Security Forces, making sure that they get the appropriate [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=126.39999999999999s)]
*  medical attention. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  We understand that the military has assigned a soldier to each individual person. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=132.76s)]
*  They also will have doctors and psychologists working around the clock to ensure they have [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=136.92s)]
*  everything that they need. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=140.95999999999998s)]
*  We saw some video earlier today. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=142.4s)]
*  The military preparing noise canceling headphones and sunglasses and blankets for these people. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=144.12s)]
*  They have in many cases been living in tunnels or in rooms sheltered from the outside world [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=149.96s)]
*  after they were dragged into Gaza on October 7. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=155.32000000000002s)]
*  We are getting more details to on where these individuals are from. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=158.88000000000002s)]
*  Early reports indicate many are from the community of Neroz, a small kibbutz that sits on the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=162.28s)]
*  border with Gaza. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=167.04000000000002s)]
*  We reported there where so many dozens of people were killed during that massacre. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=168.3s)]
*  There are also reports indicating that the individuals released will include mothers [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=173.12s)]
*  and their children. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=177.85999999999999s)]
*  And so you can just imagine how many families across Israel today are just overjoyed that [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=179.01999999999998s)]
*  these these people have been released as part of this larger deal that was negotiated by [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=184.66s)]
*  the Qataris. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=189.54s)]
*  Kaylee. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=190.54s)]
*  Trey, Kibbutz Neroz is home to little Kefir, the youngest hostage, now 10 months old, his [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=191.54s)]
*  brother Ariel, his mom Shiri. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=197.29999999999998s)]
*  We talk about them often here on Outnumbered. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=198.94s)]
*  I know we don't have any names currently that we can report to our audience, but I did hear [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=201.82s)]
*  you mention a mother and a daughter were among these hostages. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=206.79999999999998s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=210.14s)]
*  That is correct. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=213.14s)]
*  And we understand there may be multiple mothers and daughters released as part of this larger [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=214.14s)]
*  deal. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=219.72s)]
*  And we are getting in names right now, actually, of the hostages. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=220.72s)]
*  And I see on this list, you might remember a few weeks ago, Kaylee, we talked about this [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=223.95999999999998s)]
*  boy that was turning nine years old, Ohad, the little boy with glasses. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=228.9s)]
*  We brought you his photo. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=232.94s)]
*  And this was probably six weeks ago. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=233.94s)]
*  We talked about him and he is among the list back in Israel. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  And so there are so many of these people who the milestones that passed as they were in [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=239.58s)]
*  captivity, they will be returning to loved ones tonight. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=245.02s)]
*  Family members will be able to speak with them on the phone before actually seeing them [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=249.26s)]
*  in person. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=252.38s)]
*  In some cases, they'll be taken to hospitals in central Israel where they will receive [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=253.38s)]
*  that specialized care. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=257.22s)]
*  Additionally, one other name that's on the list that is quite interesting is an older [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=259.5s)]
*  woman who was previously declared dead by the factions inside Gaza, an indication that [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=263.5s)]
*  Hamas and Islamic Jihad may have been trying to use psychological terror against the Israeli [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=270.3s)]
*  people saying that some hostages were dead when they actually weren't. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=275.46s)]
*  So again, you can imagine the relief of her family. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=279.46s)]
*  It just gives you a sense of how unpredictable this situation is. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=282.06s)]
*  And really until the moment that these individuals crossed into Israel, we were not able to confirm [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=285.66s)]
*  that they were all safe and OK. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=291.86s)]
*  You started to see this video trickle out from the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=293.42s)]
*  And it gave some hope to this country because they could see there were elderly women among [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=298.5s)]
*  the group. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=302.3s)]
*  They had some assistance as they were walking, but they seemed broadly OK. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=303.3s)]
*  Some children and even some of the people waving to the individuals that were standing [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=307.16s)]
*  on the side of the road. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=312.86s)]
*  So this was facilitated again by Qatar, who helped to negotiate the deal between Israel [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=314.12s)]
*  and Hamas. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=318.68s)]
*  The plan was to get them into the hands of the Red Cross, then go into Egypt where they [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=319.76s)]
*  would be met by Shin Bet, Israel's security agency, to confirm their identities, then [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=323.92s)]
*  travel into Israel. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=328.14s)]
*  We understand actually through the Karim Shalom crossing, which is normally a crossing for [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=329.72s)]
*  goods into Gaza. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=333.56s)]
*  They are now on their way to Hatsareem Air Base where we are at right now. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=336.26s)]
*  We understand they will be evaluated again to see what sort of medical treatment that [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=339.9s)]
*  they need and then go on to local hospitals in the central part of Israel. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=343.72s)]
*  But again, tonight we can report 13 Israelis have returned into Israel as part of this [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=348.32000000000005s)]
*  larger deal that was negotiated on behalf of Qatar. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=354.44000000000005s)]
*  And remember, this is just day one of what is expected to be four days of a ceasefire. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=357.28000000000003s)]
*  And I do just want to end my producer just confirming to me now they are on their way [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=362.54s)]
*  here as we speak. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=367.68s)]
*  So possibly later in the program, we'll actually be able to show you that bus as it enters [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=368.8s)]
*  this air base behind me. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=373.48s)]
*  But again, this will just be a staging point to get them to other medical facilities. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=375.28s)]
*  As I was saying, though, this is day one of a four day ceasefire. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=380.02s)]
*  Israelis hoping to get 50 of their citizens out as part of this deal. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=383.28s)]
*  Kayleigh. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=387.64s)]
*  Trey, so you've shared with our viewers, Ohad is among the hostages released. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=388.64s)]
*  Little Ohad, we talked about him on Outnumbered. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=393.2s)]
*  He celebrated his ninth birthday in the hands of Hamas. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=395.68s)]
*  He's a beautiful young boy with glasses. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=399.28s)]
*  Our viewers may remember seeing his picture. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=401.62s)]
*  So nine year old Ohad, we understand, is freed. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=403.42s)]
*  Praise God, we prayed for him and our family. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=408.3s)]
*  But I want to ask you this, Trey, have you gotten any indication? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=411.1s)]
*  I know there was debate as to whether they would come via helicopter with those noise [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=414.14s)]
*  canceling headphones, sunglasses to shield these little children, their eyes, these mothers, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=418.22s)]
*  or whether they would come via bus or some vehicle. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=424.1s)]
*  Any indication yet? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=426.78000000000003s)]
*  Yes, so it appears they are going to come in a bus. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=428.78s)]
*  They had this helicopter on standby just in case any of the individuals were in desperate [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=432.61999999999995s)]
*  need of immediate medical attention. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=437.14s)]
*  But again, based on the images that we saw, they appear to be stable and on their way [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=438.9s)]
*  here as we speak. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=443.94s)]
*  And I do also want to note here, this information is just coming in. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=446.0s)]
*  So bear with me here as I read this. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=448.61999999999995s)]
*  But it appears that Ohad's mom, yeah, and his grandma are released as well. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=450.62s)]
*  And it just gives you a sense of these families and the relief that they're going to have [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=457.82s)]
*  tonight. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=461.54s)]
*  Kaylee. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=462.54s)]
*  Praise God, an answered prayer in an absolutely horrific situation. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=463.54s)]
*  Trey Yanks, thank you so much for your phenomenal coverage as always. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=468.58s)]
*  Tammy Bruce, Ohad is freed. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=473.46s)]
*  He celebrated his ninth birthday in captivity. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=476.3s)]
*  Ohad was described as a bright kid who loves soccer, tennis and solving the Rubik's Cube. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=479.78000000000003s)]
*  I hope they have a Rubik's Cube among those toys there. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=486.18s)]
*  You know, it is the reason why you don't second guess Israel's decisions here. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=489.34000000000003s)]
*  This was and continues to be ransom to get those innocent people back home. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=495.24s)]
*  There he is. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=500.90000000000003s)]
*  Everyone ranging from the grandmothers to the children. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=502.70000000000005s)]
*  This is his generation now is a generation that should never have to face this again. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=507.26s)]
*  It has happened for two millennia against the Jews. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=512.0600000000001s)]
*  This is what the world has seen. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=516.02s)]
*  We've certainly the 20th century within living memory of the children at the camps being [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=518.1800000000001s)]
*  separated and gassed first. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=523.26s)]
*  So this is something that regarding the human condition, crimes against humanity, the focus [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=525.9s)]
*  and deliberation of Israel of saving the innocent, their own innocent, the innocence of so many [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=533.02s)]
*  other nations involved in this now. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=539.3000000000001s)]
*  But hopefully that when it comes to the sentiment of the Israeli people that this they understand [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=542.02s)]
*  this can't continue to do what you can to get as many innocent people out without once [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=548.38s)]
*  again giving up, which has been the history here of this is why I think Hamas was surprised [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=554.14s)]
*  at the Israeli reaction, which is shocking. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=559.1800000000001s)]
*  But this has been the circle for now decades. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=561.74s)]
*  Clearly I think Israel knows it has to stop that the generation of the children leaving [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=566.86s)]
*  this terrorism and this is psychological terrorism, which continues, has got to be the last generation [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=571.9399999999999s)]
*  that experiences this in this dynamic. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=578.06s)]
*  No doubt about it. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=580.42s)]
*  You know, Joe Concha, Ohad, the photo, I'm not sure if this is the one we put up, but [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=581.42s)]
*  there was some Hebrew written on it when we first showed his photo here on outnumbered. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=586.1s)]
*  And the Hebrew said, you're welcome to celebrate my birthday. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=590.18s)]
*  So they wanted the nation, the globe to celebrate Ohad's birthday. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=594.3399999999999s)]
*  Once a hostage, now a free nine year old boy. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=598.14s)]
*  And it's great to hear that there is a mother and a grandmother waiting for him. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=600.6999999999999s)]
*  Thank God. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=605.3399999999999s)]
*  My son turns nine this year. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=606.3399999999999s)]
*  I know the mindset of an eight, nine year old boy. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=607.3399999999999s)]
*  I can't imagine the hell that he went through. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=609.38s)]
*  But there's another birthday that's being celebrated today and that's by Abigail Moradon. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=613.06s)]
*  She's only three now, four years old today. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=617.58s)]
*  And she, if she's released, she goes from one hell of being in these tunnels with these [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=620.86s)]
*  terrorists for 49 days and out to another where either she thinks she's going to be [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=626.14s)]
*  reunited with her parents who were murdered or she witnessed her parents being murdered. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=629.9000000000001s)]
*  And then she was taken hostage for 49 days. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=634.6800000000001s)]
*  You talk about the human story here, Tammy, that that's a story where you just wonder [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=637.1s)]
*  if a girl like that can ever have a normal life ever again. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=640.74s)]
*  Yeah, no, well said, Kara. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=644.0200000000001s)]
*  And when we talk about this kibbutz, as I mentioned, Kefir, the 10 month old, the youngest [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=646.54s)]
*  hostage was from this kibbutz. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=651.58s)]
*  So too is Ariel, his brother, his mom, Shiri, his dad, Yarden. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=653.3s)]
*  And one of his family members wrote this and I want to read it because I think it really [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=658.1s)]
*  puts the mind of our viewers in the mind of someone who has a family member in captivity. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=662.58s)]
*  We must muster the little strength that we have to avoid falling apart. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=668.3s)]
*  We try to resist the urge to anticipate, hope, celebrate or even imagine because never before [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=672.46s)]
*  has anyone felt so close and yet so far away from something at the same time. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=678.1s)]
*  I imagine there are hundreds of families out there with those exact feelings and emotions [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=683.0600000000001s)]
*  right now. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=687.84s)]
*  Oh, and it's devastating when you think about, you know, we're mothers here. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=688.84s)]
*  I couldn't imagine this happening to my own young child. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=692.3000000000001s)]
*  And what I think we should bear witness to, I think it's very much worth talking about. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=696.4200000000001s)]
*  What Israel sacrificed to do this, the moral character of their leadership in order to [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=702.02s)]
*  make this deal. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=708.22s)]
*  When you think about it, they had a lot of momentum on the battlefield in Gaza. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=709.64s)]
*  They sacrificed that. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=713.74s)]
*  They're letting the Hamas terrorists refit, rest and shore up their defenses for the backside [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=714.78s)]
*  of this fighting. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=722.18s)]
*  And they're doing it because they're saying every one of our citizens matters, women, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=723.46s)]
*  children, every single one of them that matters. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=727.9s)]
*  So we're going to give up that strategic positioning on the battlefield, knowing that [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=730.06s)]
*  it's going to put IDF soldiers at risk on the backside of all this too. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=734.6999999999999s)]
*  And they did it anyway, because that is who they are. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=738.8199999999999s)]
*  That is who they are. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=742.02s)]
*  And at the same time, you know, these families, you imagine these children coming home, these [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=743.5799999999999s)]
*  mothers coming home, there's the uncertainties. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=747.78s)]
*  What state are they in psychologically, physically, emotionally? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=750.6999999999999s)]
*  We know the Israeli government has gone to great pains knowing that for 49 days, these [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=753.78s)]
*  individuals were in the dark, probably in cells, making sure they have glasses, noise [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=757.86s)]
*  canceling headphones, consulting with Holocaust survivors, excuse me, even to make sure every [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=762.4200000000001s)]
*  detail is perfect. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=767.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=768.7s)]
*  And I look at the picture of the children who are still over there, who have now been [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=769.7s)]
*  released and who will soon be getting off that bus. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=773.1400000000001s)]
*  And I hope that every single leftist who was tearing down those posters in New York, in [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=775.5400000000001s)]
*  D.C., in cities across the country, are forced to watch those children as they get off that [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=780.4200000000001s)]
*  bus and realize that those are the pictures that they were tearing down. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=785.54s)]
*  Those are the innocent civilians that were trapped in Gaza in tunnels in the dark and [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=789.54s)]
*  were forced to suffer for 49 days. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=794.18s)]
*  And I think you touch on an important point that even Trey mentioned. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=796.74s)]
*  The psychological warfare that Hamas is still using in this to torture Israeli civilians [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=799.62s)]
*  is a very important element, because the fact is that there are about 240 hostages, now [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=805.3399999999999s)]
*  about 220 hostages in Gaza. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=809.98s)]
*  There is no guarantee that they're going to get all 240 hostages back. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=813.62s)]
*  There's no guarantee that all 240 hostages are going to be able to return to their homes [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=817.58s)]
*  because their homes have been burned, their family members have been killed. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=821.62s)]
*  And the fact is that Hamas is holding that over Israel's head in an attempt to gain [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=825.0600000000001s)]
*  leverage and to prevent Israel from conducting its offensive mission. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=829.7800000000001s)]
*  This needs to be addressed, and I wish that more outlets would spend time covering that [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=833.94s)]
*  aspect of it. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=837.82s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=838.82s)]
*  Well said. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=839.82s)]
*  As the first hostages are finally released from Hamas captivity today, the White House [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=840.82s)]
*  says it, quote, is doing all we can to free Americans still captive in Gaza. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=845.34s)]
*  We'll bring you a live report on those efforts next. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=850.86s)]
*  Hey, everyone. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2cLsnMaMbw&t=853.58s)]
