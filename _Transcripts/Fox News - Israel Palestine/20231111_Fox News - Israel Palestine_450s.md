*  All right, welcome back to the big weekend show tonight. More shocking displays of anti-Semitism and pro Hamas messaging from New York City [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Where crowds shut down Grand Central Station to London were hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets to call for a ceasefire [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=7.5600000000000005s)]

*  But this one was a little bit different because it coincided with Armistice Day here in the UK [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=24.46s)]
*  Which marks the end of World War one a commemorative weekend celebrate here in the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=30.0s)]
*  Remembrance weekend here in the United Kingdom to remember the war dead [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=34.56s)]
*  The prime minister here was she Sunni can call this protest [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=38.58s)]
*  disrespectful and provocative [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=42.64s)]
*  But still the pro-Palestinian protests going on again for yet another weekend since the October 7th [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=44.04s)]
*  Hamas attacks in Israel the route today takes them in front of the US Embassy along the Thames River a [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Different from previous weekends which took them [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=57.02s)]
*  Through government center areas they want to avoid that on this particular weekend because to protect a notable British War Memorial [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=59.82s)]
*  the Cenotaph [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=67.82000000000001s)]
*  Since these protests started after October 7th [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=69.9s)]
*  Metropolitan police have made hundreds of arrests many of them involving hate crimes including anti-Semitic crimes as well as alleged Islamic phobic offenses [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=73.22s)]
*  in London Molly Lyon Fox News [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  All right, so people are taking to the streets showing their support for Hamas or [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=86.94s)]
*  Palestine or is it Hamas? We're not sure and unfortunately, they're not sure guy [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=92.22s)]
*  I want to read this quote to you just to talk about how social media has been really involved in how people are getting their [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=96.38s)]
*  Messaging it says protester. I do believe social media in general has played a role [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=102.84s)]
*  Reporter, where did you learn was it mainly tick-tock protester? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=108.5s)]
*  Another protester. Yeah, actually it was [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=113.98s)]
*  And then another protester everyone posts and that's and that's how we're going to make a difference [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=116.82000000000001s)]
*  Honestly another protester everyone else is sharing it. That's how the message is getting out [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=123.42s)]
*  Mm-hmm, and the algorithm is doing its thing. Yeah, I think it's why you see online young people much more likely to support Palestine [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=129.38s)]
*  effectively in many cases Hamas in this [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=138.38s)]
*  Conflict I saw a clip going around from London the other day where some of the people being interviewed had not even heard about the October 7th [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=141.70000000000002s)]
*  Massacre, yes, you didn't know about it. Yeah, they just assume this all came out of nowhere [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=148.18s)]
*  Let's go protest Israel for some reason meanwhile here at home, Joey [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=151.42000000000002s)]
*  The NYPD just put out statistics from October from last month [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=155.78s)]
*  There's been an uptick a significant one in hate crimes of the confirmed hate crimes just in New York City [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=160.38s)]
*  Last month almost 70% of them were against Jews [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=167.14s)]
*  I know the administration is all about Islamophobia right now [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=171.26s)]
*  But 70% nearly of these hate crimes were targeting Jews in New York City and last night in New York City [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=174.33999999999997s)]
*  To help celebrate Veterans Day you had some of these masked pro Hamas agitators [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=181.42s)]
*  Literally tearing down American flags [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=187.73999999999998s)]
*  And I just wonder here in the West in the United States and in the United Kingdom when you have [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=190.51999999999998s)]
*  Veterans Day weekend being sort of polluted with some of this violence and some of the most vile things that are being said the ripping down [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=196.72s)]
*  Of our flag in our country [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=203.84s)]
*  Yesterday and then in London armistice day to honor the British fallen the government asked the protesters [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=206.95999999999998s)]
*  Maybe hold off this weekend for once they of course said middle finger [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=212.88s)]
*  That was feeling a fire to be some sort of a backlash here Anita to stick with this what happened in New York City [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=216.56s)]
*  There was a New York police card [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=221.88s)]
*  It was graffitied with hateful things all over it [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=223.23999999999998s)]
*  But we also have a graphic here to show some of those statistics you're talking about [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=226.35999999999999s)]
*  So we're looking at hate crime reports just in New York City from October 23 versus 22 [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  And I think we have a graphic for this, but it's 214 percent surge. I found some numbers here in October of this year [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=234.72s)]
*  69 of [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=243.51999999999998s)]
*  Targeting harassment or crimes against Jews versus eight against Muslim and I want to point that out [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=245.96s)]
*  Not because and right here's another from tick-tock actually is even better the phrase stand with Palestine [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=251.48000000000002s)]
*  285 million impressions the phrase stand with Israel 64 million impressions [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=258.12s)]
*  So it shows you even the complicity within the algorithm as as guy pointed out [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=262.32s)]
*  But to look at this I think what bothers me is when the administration addresses it they cannot address [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=266.68s)]
*  Antisemitism without throwing in Islamophobia. I feel like they're not the same thing right now in this moment [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=273.36s)]
*  Yeah, well, they're clearly not the same thing when you look at those numbers [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=277.92s)]
*  Yeah, they are not the same thing, you know and to guys point about the algorithm and social media [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=280.9s)]
*  And there's no question that it is fueling these these protests now look in the United States [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=286.92s)]
*  We have the First Amendment. We have the Constitution [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=292.12s)]
*  It's a great thing to have the right to protest march with your signs chant do what you want to do [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=294.82s)]
*  But you really cross the line when you provoke violence when you start intimidating people threatening people [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=300.62s)]
*  I heard a report the other day where Jewish students are afraid to enter their campuses through the front gates [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=307.02s)]
*  So, you know my concern is that this is a long war in Israel [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=314.46s)]
*  This is going to go on for a long time. So how long did the protests go on? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=319.76s)]
*  Exactly Sarah want to bring you in on this. I think this is really important [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=325.26s)]
*  So I did this research myself found this myself [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=328.26s)]
*  There's people that are I guess are famous from social media [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=331.58s)]
*  I'm gonna use this don't get on to me if these are real famous people [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=335.21999999999997s)]
*  Gigi and Bella Hadid their father's a billionaire [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=338.98s)]
*  Palestinian who's advocated for Palestinian cause they have a combined hundred and forty million followers [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=342.5s)]
*  But then you add to that on Instagram people like Mark Ruffalo, which I know who that is [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=347.5s)]
*  Dua Lipa, Jenna Ortega, and I know who this is [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=351.78s)]
*  McLemore are all posting things that are either sympathetic to Hamas outright supporting of Hamas or [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=356.26s)]
*  sympathetic to tearing down the posters of those that are that are [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=363.61999999999995s)]
*  That are hostage and I guess on the other side you have Gal Gadot [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=367.29999999999995s)]
*  That's trying to just support her country that she served [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=370.94s)]
*  Well, look at it this way the ADL did a great study. This was between 2022 and 2023 [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=374.78s)]
*  Where they were able to trace dark money back to Iran this attack in Israel took two years [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=381.9s)]
*  Two years basically people believed to plan and prepare Iran was behind it. They used Hamas as a proxy [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=388.09999999999997s)]
*  But is you know [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=394.73999999999995s)]
*  Iran is not just gonna focus on that attack Iran's gonna focus on the big picture targeting the United States using the internet [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=396.73999999999995s)]
*  Using those people that you just mentioned on social media to push a narrative how fast did they move? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=404.84s)]
*  They moved after October 7 so quickly so quickly that there was no time to even focus on Israel [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=411.88s)]
*  And what happened to Israel because the movement had already shifted and the narrative is and I think with the idea of tick-tock and Instagram [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=419.09999999999997s)]
*  Being so instrumental and how young Americans get information back to your point [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=424.91999999999996s)]
*  This is not gonna be a short war and if the algorithm and the propaganda war is already against Israel that really hurts their ability [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=429.14s)]
*  To continue this and see it to its end. Hey Sean Hannity here [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OK5J3FBuQQ&t=436.06s)]
