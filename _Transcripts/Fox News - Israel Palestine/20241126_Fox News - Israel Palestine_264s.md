# Russia launches record number of drones in new attack
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg)
*  And a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon is reportedly very close to being [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=0.0s)]
*  sealed. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=4.96s)]
*  The Israeli Security Cabinet is reportedly expected to meet today to discuss a U.S. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=5.96s)]
*  brokered agreement. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, also a Fox News contributor, joins us now. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=11.72s)]
*  I want you to listen to the State Department spokesperson, Matt Miller. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=15.44s)]
*  What I'd say is we have made significant progress with getting towards a resolution that includes [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=18.88s)]
*  progress from where we were when I spoke to this last week, but we're not done yet. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=28.04s)]
*  Nothing is final until everything is final. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=32.8s)]
*  We continue to work to try and get an agreement over the line, and we're hopeful we can get [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=35.04s)]
*  one, but we need both of the parties to get to yes. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=39.48s)]
*  What do you think of the agreement as you understand it so far? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=42.96s)]
*  Well, Dana, it sounds like it's a 60-day agreement. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  That shouldn't surprise anyone that there's about 60 days until President Trump takes [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=50.76s)]
*  office. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=54.56s)]
*  I think the Israelis were put under enormous pressure to sign this ceasefire. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=56.080000000000005s)]
*  We should all note that it's not a peace deal. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=59.24s)]
*  It's not a long-term arrangement. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=61.6s)]
*  It's just a temporary ceasefire for a couple of months. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=63.160000000000004s)]
*  And we'll see if the Hezbollah warriors violate this as they violated virtually every other [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=66.36s)]
*  agreement that they have signed, and they go right back at it. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=70.76s)]
*  I hope the Israelis have made a good decision. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=74.16s)]
*  They know more about this than any of us do, so I have confidence that they have this right. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=76.08s)]
*  But unfortunately, I think the American administration and the Biden team put a lot of pressure on [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=80.5s)]
*  them at the United Nations to sign this. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=85.32s)]
*  And we all know, had they agreed to a ceasefire when they were originally told to do it by [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=87.75999999999999s)]
*  the Biden administration, there'd be a lot more terrorists and a lot more risk, not only [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=91.8s)]
*  for Israel, but the United States today. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=95.52s)]
*  So we'll have to see what's in this and unpack it when we do. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  So in the commercial break, Bill Hemmer and I were talking about how when he was there [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=101.16s)]
*  in 2006 during that war covering it, and Hezbollah never really stopped the fighting. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=104.84s)]
*  Dana, that's exactly right. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=111.24s)]
*  I suspect they won't. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=115.16s)]
*  And we should not for a moment mistake Hezbollah for the core problem. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  The core problem is their Iranian sponsors in Tehran. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=120.96s)]
*  The Iranians aren't signing onto this deal. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  And so goodness knows whether the attacks will now come from Syria, the attacks will [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=126.91999999999999s)]
*  continue from Gaza. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  The challenge that is presented to Israel is much deeper than just the missiles and [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=131.88s)]
*  the missile systems up in the north. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=136.44s)]
*  And we'll see. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=138.78s)]
*  I suspect Hezbollah will continue to build, continue its commercial criminal enterprises [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=139.78s)]
*  that have funded it for so long and that this ceasefire will prove ephemeral. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=143.58s)]
*  But I hope I'm wrong. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=148.54000000000002s)]
*  More peace is always better. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=149.82000000000002s)]
*  And of course the Israelis want to be able to move the citizens back to that part of [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=151.18s)]
*  the country since they've been displaced since October 7th. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=154.82000000000002s)]
*  Also want to ask about this, go to another theater. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=157.62s)]
*  Let's go to Russia and Ukraine. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=159.3s)]
*  And Russia launching a record drone attack on Ukraine. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=160.76000000000002s)]
*  Here's the Washington Post headline. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=164.06s)]
*  Ukraine prepares to sell Trump on why U.S. should maintain support. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=166.22s)]
*  That might be difficult if you look at this poll here. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=170.7s)]
*  This is done before the Biden administration allowed Ukraine to use these new weapons. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=173.58s)]
*  But support has been dwindling. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=179.82s)]
*  And there are a lot of people who think that, you know, we're maybe either doing too much [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=181.38s)]
*  or about right. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=185.7s)]
*  The Ukrainians certainly want more. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=187.36s)]
*  But there will soon be a new sheriff in town. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=189.02s)]
*  What can you expect? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=190.9s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=191.9s)]
*  There will be a new sheriff in town. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=194.9s)]
*  And I suspect that will fundamentally change the nature of Vladimir Putin's actions. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=196.06s)]
*  Dan and Bill, we for four years kept Vladimir Putin from invading Ukraine. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=201.1s)]
*  We had a deterrence model that worked. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=204.84s)]
*  And when President Trump is back in power, back on the scene, I suspect that that deterrence [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=207.12s)]
*  model will reestablish itself. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=211.66s)]
*  And make no mistake about it, President Trump was very clear. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=213.42000000000002s)]
*  We put real pressure on Russia not to do precisely what they did, cause trouble in the world, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=216.78s)]
*  as they had under President Obama when they took Crimea and as they did again under President [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=222.86s)]
*  Biden. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=227.34s)]
*  I think that the missile attack at a real scale last night into Ukraine is evidence [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=228.34s)]
*  that Vladimir Putin knows that this is his maximum point of leverage and that in 60 days [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=232.44000000000003s)]
*  fundamentally his leverage will have decreased and the shaping of that conflict will have [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=238.3s)]
*  fundamentally changed as well. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=242.86s)]
*  Well, we will pay attention to it and keep talking to you as well. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=244.46s)]
*  Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, thanks for joining us this morning. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=247.86s)]
*  Dana, thank you. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz8vGwr3dg&t=250.54000000000002s)]
