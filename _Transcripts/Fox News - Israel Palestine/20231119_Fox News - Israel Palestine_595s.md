# US sen reveals a ‘good development’ on hostages in Gaza
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8)
*  Joining us now, Delaware Democratic Senator Chris Coons. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=0.0s)]
*  He's a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=2.56s)]
*  and co-chair of the president's re-election campaign. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=5.04s)]
*  Senator, welcome back to Fox News Sunday. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=7.72s)]
*  Thanks, Shannon. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=10.84s)]
*  It's great to be on with you again. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=11.68s)]
*  Okay, so let's talk about this. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=13.02s)]
*  The White House, the National Security Commission [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=14.76s)]
*  is saying, National Security Council, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=17.2s)]
*  there's not a deal yet, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=19.42s)]
*  but there is talk of this potential ceasefire deal, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=20.5s)]
*  three to five days maybe, dozens of hostages maybe. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=22.84s)]
*  But the president's got a brand new op-ed out today, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  and he wrote this in the op-ed, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=28.099999999999998s)]
*  as long as Hamas clings to its ideology of destruction [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=29.74s)]
*  as ceasefire is not peace, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=32.46s)]
*  to Hamas' members, every ceasefire is time. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=34.339999999999996s)]
*  They exploit to rebuild their stockpile of rockets, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=37.42s)]
*  reposition fighters, and restart the killing [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=40.3s)]
*  by attacking innocents again. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=42.5s)]
*  You're at the Halifax International Security Forum. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=45.04s)]
*  How is talk of the ceasefire playing there? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=47.08s)]
*  So Shannon, President Biden has been clear and forceful [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=50.94s)]
*  in responding to Hamas' terrible, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  horrific terrorist attacks of six weeks ago. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=57.32s)]
*  He went to Israel, he embraced Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=60.4s)]
*  He's deployed two aircraft carrier groups [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=63.959999999999994s)]
*  to push back on any potential for Iran [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=66.64s)]
*  to try and strengthen and broaden the conflict [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=69.62s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=71.72s)]
*  And here at the Halifax Security Conference this weekend, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=72.67999999999999s)]
*  a bipartisan delegation from Congress [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=75.72s)]
*  met with leaders from across our NATO allies [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=78.32s)]
*  and from other countries, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=81.4s)]
*  where there are folks here [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=82.64s)]
*  who are advocates for freedom. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=83.76s)]
*  So human rights advocates from countries like Iran [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=85.4s)]
*  and Venezuela and Russia, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=88.68s)]
*  opponents of the current regimes, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=90.16000000000001s)]
*  as well as partners from Canada, from Germany, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=92.16000000000001s)]
*  from other NATO countries, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=94.72s)]
*  legislators from Taiwan and elsewhere. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=96.56s)]
*  And there've been lots of conversations [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=98.84s)]
*  about the importance of the United States [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=101.28s)]
*  standing strong behind Ukraine [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=103.68s)]
*  and our more than 50 partners in supporting Ukraine [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  in their resistance to Russian aggression [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=109.4s)]
*  and standing strong in supporting Israel [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=111.88s)]
*  in their important work against the terrorists of Hamas. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=114.36s)]
*  News of a potential hostage deal, Shannon, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  is great news just before Thanksgiving [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=120.16s)]
*  for the 10 American families [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=122.72s)]
*  whose loved ones are being held hostage [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=124.6s)]
*  and the more than 230 others. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=126.64s)]
*  I've met with those families, Shannon, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=128.51999999999998s)]
*  in Tel Aviv and in Washington, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=130.51999999999998s)]
*  and it's heartbreaking to be with parents [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=132.72s)]
*  who don't know how their children are doing [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  and who believe they are being held in tunnels [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=137.35999999999999s)]
*  by Hamas beneath Gaza. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=139.64s)]
*  This is a good development today. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=141.52s)]
*  But the president himself in this op-ed, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=143.32000000000002s)]
*  which as you note, it links together the fights against Russia [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=145.48000000000002s)]
*  and its aggression in Ukraine, Hamas. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=148.88000000000002s)]
*  But the president himself expresses grave concern [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=151.48000000000002s)]
*  about what a ceasefire would allow Hamas to do [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=154.04000000000002s)]
*  in continuing to kill and re-equip. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=156.52s)]
*  Is there a concern about that part of the equation? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=158.88s)]
*  Well, let's draw a distinction here, Shannon, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=162.56s)]
*  between a ceasefire. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=164.52s)]
*  Some folks are calling for a ceasefire [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  in protests across Europe and in our country [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  by which they mean Israel should stop fighting Hamas, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=171.48s)]
*  should end their campaign in Gaza, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=175.48s)]
*  or a pause that has been negotiated [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  between Israel and Hamas [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=180.95999999999998s)]
*  to allow the release of hostages, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=182.83999999999997s)]
*  Israeli and American and other nationalities hostages, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=185.28s)]
*  and allow food and fuel and medicine to get in to Gaza. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=189.04s)]
*  A negotiated brief pause in the fighting, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=193.67999999999998s)]
*  I think would be a good thing, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=196.44s)]
*  and I would strongly support. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=197.79999999999998s)]
*  A ceasefire meaning an end to Israel's campaign against Hamas, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=199.36s)]
*  I don't support, and neither does the president. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=203.60000000000002s)]
*  Okay, let's talk about the fact that Israel aid [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=205.72000000000003s)]
*  is tied up in the politics of Washington. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=208.4s)]
*  Every Democratic senator voted no [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=210.84s)]
*  against the package the House had passed. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=212.88000000000002s)]
*  It takes money from the IRS [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=214.88000000000002s)]
*  to fund that standalone Israel aid. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=216.08s)]
*  So now the conversation is this bigger supplemental. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=217.72000000000003s)]
*  The White House wants Ukraine [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=220.24s)]
*  and all kinds of things tied together. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=221.48000000000002s)]
*  There are a number of GOP senators who say [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=223.4s)]
*  it will not move forward Ukraine funding [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=225.04000000000002s)]
*  unless it's coupled with serious change to border policy, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=227.72s)]
*  not more money for the border for processing people in, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=230.48000000000002s)]
*  but actually having a more secure structure [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=233.24s)]
*  against people showing up and entering [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=235.6s)]
*  without our way to track them [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=237.6s)]
*  and moving through the country. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=238.96s)]
*  The president's issue or approval [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=240.92000000000002s)]
*  on this issue of the border, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=243.04000000000002s)]
*  he's upside down by 30 points on this. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=244.44s)]
*  Americans don't think he's handling it well. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=246.84s)]
*  At the same time, House Homeland Security [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=249.16s)]
*  has a committee report out this week saying [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=250.88s)]
*  that what's happening at the border [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=253.56s)]
*  could cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=255.12s)]
*  excuse me, billions of dollars a year. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=257.88s)]
*  And saying this, it's morally unacceptable [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=259.76s)]
*  that American taxpayer dollars should be funneled [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=262.08000000000004s)]
*  to those who violate our laws [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=264.2s)]
*  and demand expansive taxpayer funded benefits [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=265.84000000000003s)]
*  like education, healthcare, housing, and more. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=269.40000000000003s)]
*  Where are we on negotiations in the Senate [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=272.04s)]
*  about change to border policy [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=274.12s)]
*  as it may be tied to Ukraine funding? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=275.76s)]
*  Shannon, there is a bipartisan group of senators [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=279.04s)]
*  who've been working hard this weekend, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=281.52000000000004s)]
*  last week, and will continue working [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=284.0s)]
*  through the Thanksgiving holiday [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=286.03999999999996s)]
*  to come forward with a proposal [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=287.35999999999996s)]
*  for a few focused policy changes [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=289.28s)]
*  that would address the dramatic increase in recent months [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=291.96s)]
*  in the number of folks crossing our border. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=295.2s)]
*  We have to strike an important balance here, Shannon, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=297.47999999999996s)]
*  between protecting America's historic role [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=300.08s)]
*  as a place of asylum for those [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=302.79999999999995s)]
*  who are genuinely fleeing oppression [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=304.44s)]

*  additional appropriation to improve border security [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=331.0s)]
*  in our history. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=334.28s)]
*  I think we can and should find them at the ground here [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=335.4s)]
*  and move forward to secure our border. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=338.56s)]
*  Republicans are saying that that's money [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=339.72s)]

*  potentially million, gotaways, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=350.24s)]

*  or where they are in this country, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=353.44s)]

*  Shannon, that's a mischaracterization [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=363.0s)]
*  of the supplemental request. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=364.72s)]

*  border patrol agents, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=369.64000000000004s)]
*  custom and border patrol agents, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=371.12s)]

*  advanced non-intrusive inspection, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=375.44s)]

*  So to say that the additional funding request [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=386.36s)]
*  is just to process more people into the United States [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=389.64000000000004s)]
*  misses a core goal of that funding request, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=392.88s)]
*  but I'll say this, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=395.72s)]
*  I'm willing to work with Republicans on changing policy [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=396.92s)]
*  to make sure that we protect asylum [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=400.64000000000004s)]
*  as something that genuinely protects those [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=403.0s)]
*  with a legitimate asylum claim [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=405.64000000000004s)]
*  and yet reduces the number of folks crossing the border [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=407.52000000000004s)]
*  who ultimately don't have a legitimate asylum claim [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=410.56s)]
*  and years later will be deported. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=413.56s)]
*  That is a middle point that we should work on together [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=415.32000000000005s)]
*  because it's critical that we fund Ukraine, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=418.68s)]
*  that we fund Israel, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=421.40000000000003s)]
*  and that we provide humanitarian relief, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=422.56s)]
*  which is the other key part of this package. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=425.0s)]
*  The week before Thanksgiving, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=427.56s)]
*  I hope folks will reflect on the fact [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=428.96s)]
*  that providing humanitarian assistance into Ukraine, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=431.16s)]
*  into Gaza and a dozen other countries [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=434.8s)]
*  is something that is a long bipartisan tradition [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=437.12s)]
*  in the United States [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=439.88s)]
*  and a key part of our leadership in the world. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=441.04s)]
*  And it does seem like there's almost, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=442.8s)]
*  not total, but almost universal support [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=444.04s)]
*  for that humanitarian aid. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=447.12s)]
*  I know there are a few voices out there [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=448.6s)]
*  who think there need to be serious strings tied to that. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=450.2s)]
*  Wanna talk to you about 2024 [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=452.92s)]
*  because you are co-chairing [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=454.32s)]
*  the President's National Re-Election campaign. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=455.44s)]
*  David Axelrod, Senior Advisor at one point [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=457.88s)]
*  to President Obama, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=460.44s)]
*  a key player in the Obama-Biden administration, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=461.6s)]
*  says this, I think he has a 50-50 shot here, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=464.04s)]
*  but no better than that. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=466.88s)]
*  Maybe a little worse. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=468.72s)]
*  They've got a real problem [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=470.28000000000003s)]
*  that they're counting on Trump to win it for them. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=471.40000000000003s)]
*  I remember Hillary doing that too. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=473.48s)]
*  We've got scores of new polling at Fox News [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=476.12s)]
*  that all paint a very tough picture [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=478.40000000000003s)]
*  on re-election for the White House [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=480.20000000000005s)]
*  and there are polls, Marquette and USA Today [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=481.44s)]
*  and many others that also show serious problems [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=484.2s)]
*  for this President and his re-election campaign. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=486.88s)]
*  What do you make of David Axelrod's comments? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=489.04s)]
*  That's an interesting point from David. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=491.8s)]
*  In 2007, a year out from the 2008 election, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=493.76s)]
*  I'll remind you that poll after poll was showing [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=497.88s)]
*  that Barack Obama was going to lose to Rudy Giuliani [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=500.52s)]
*  and in 2011 that Barack Obama was gonna lose to Mitt Romney. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=504.2s)]
*  Head-to-head polls a year out, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=508.48s)]
*  frankly don't say much at all. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=509.92s)]
*  What matters is the elections that just happened. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=511.48s)]
*  The off-year elections were very positive [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=514.88s)]
*  for Democrats across the country. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=517.72s)]
*  We far exceeded expectations in 2022 [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=519.84s)]
*  in the midterm elections. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=523.0s)]
*  So across special elections, midterm elections, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=524.2s)]
*  I see real positives for this President [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=528.32s)]
*  and those are rooted in his record of actual accomplishment. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=530.6800000000001s)]
*  We have the lowest unemployment [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=533.76s)]
*  for the longest period of time in modern American history. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=535.5600000000001s)]
*  He's really accomplished significant things [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=539.12s)]
*  on a bipartisan basis, investments in infrastructure, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=541.64s)]
*  reducing prescription drug prices, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=545.28s)]
*  investments in community mental health and in gun safety [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=547.48s)]
*  and frankly, rebuilding advanced manufacturing. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=550.72s)]
*  I came out of manufacturing to run for office. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=553.52s)]
*  We've seen 800,000 new high quality manufacturing jobs [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=557.12s)]
*  created, part of the 14 million new jobs [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=561.48s)]
*  in just the last two years. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=564.24s)]
*  That's a strong record to run on Shannon [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=565.6800000000001s)]
*  and I believe the President will make that case [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=567.8399999999999s)]
*  in the coming year. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=569.7199999999999s)]
*  Well, you know, on the jobs numbers, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=570.56s)]
*  a number of fact checkers, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=571.52s)]
*  including across the political spectrum has said, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=572.4399999999999s)]
*  it's not accurate to say those jobs were created. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=574.4799999999999s)]
*  Many of them came back after COVID, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=576.64s)]
*  but they aren't counting as new jobs. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=579.24s)]
*  And for whatever reason, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=580.5999999999999s)]
*  all of the things that you listed [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=581.8399999999999s)]
*  are not yet resonating with the American electorate. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=583.0799999999999s)]
*  We're gonna talk about more polls further into the show [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=585.5999999999999s)]
*  and we'll see how that actually works out in the year to come. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=588.64s)]
*  A year is a long time in politics, Senator. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN-piUgJzn8&t=591.7199999999999s)]
