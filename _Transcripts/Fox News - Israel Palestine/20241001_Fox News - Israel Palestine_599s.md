# Trey Yingst warns of 'catastrophe in the making' for Americans in Lebanon
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ)
*  our own Trey Yank reporting from Haifa in northern Israel. Trey. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Harris, good afternoon. Overnight I was with Israeli forces as they entered [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=6.4s)]
*  southern Lebanon going after Hezbollah positions along the border. It was the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=10.88s)]
*  first time since 2000 and six that Israel entered into Lebanon on the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=15.64s)]
*  ground, at least publicly. And the Israelis say they will continue their [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=20.38s)]
*  operations against Hezbollah this morning. They warned civilians in more [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=24.16s)]
*  than 20 different villages and towns to evacuate further north, another [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=28.22s)]
*  indication that Israeli operations inside Lebanon on the ground are [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=33.019999999999996s)]
*  expected to expand. And it comes as tonight this country is bracing for a [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=37.46s)]
*  possible ballistic missile attack by Iran and maybe even its proxies like [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=41.66s)]
*  Hezbollah or the Houthis in Yemen. We do know that tonight the U. S. Embassy is [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=46.42s)]
*  warning personnel to stay close to shelters. Also Israel's second largest [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=51.18s)]
*  city of Tel Aviv, urging residents to stay home and close to their mamads, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=55.58s)]
*  the Hebrew word for shelter. As we look forward here to what is likely to take [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=60.32s)]
*  place, Israel's top spokesman Daniel Higari for the military is warning of [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=65.25999999999999s)]
*  an imminent missile attack from Iran that would be significant, possibly [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=70.02s)]
*  even larger than the attack that we saw back in April that included around 300 [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=74.38s)]
*  ballistic and cruise missiles along with drones. Right now, the region is at a [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=79.25999999999999s)]
*  precipice and there are real consultations taking place right now [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=83.94000000000001s)]
*  among the defense echelon of Israel about what comes next and what a [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=88.02000000000001s)]
*  possible Israeli response would be to a large scale missile attack from Iran. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=92.14s)]
*  Remember, just last weekend, the Israelis took out Hassan Nasrallah, the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=96.82000000000001s)]
*  leader of Hezbollah, Iran's largest proxy in the Middle East. And there are [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=100.52000000000001s)]
*  concerns today that Iran will directly retaliate for that strike in Beirut [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=104.54s)]
*  over the weekend. Harris? All right, just real quickly, because I'm gonna run [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=108.9s)]
*  this past you. This is from the State Department now reporting coming into [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=113.06s)]
*  Fox News. The United States is not evacuating Americans from Lebanon at [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=115.94s)]
*  this point. As of right now, the U. S. Is not getting them out, nor does it [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=119.8s)]
*  have any plans to send evacuation flights to rescue those if they're [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=123.82000000000001s)]
*  stranded inside the country as the conflict with Israel intensifies. And [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=127.0s)]
*  this part, Trey, latest publicly available data from the State [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=131.3s)]
*  Department shows 86,000 Americans living in Lebanon as of 2022. That's a [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=135.38s)]
*  lot of people to move if you've got to do it quickly. How many times do we have [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=141.98s)]
*  to learn this lesson? Like we know that this is the case. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=145.62s)]
*  I'm glad we're talking about this because it's a really important part of [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=151.88s)]
*  the story. There are tens of thousands of Americans still in Lebanon as this [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=154.66s)]
*  war expands. And there are two questions at hand. One, when will the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=158.82s)]
*  United States start to refer to this as a war between Israel and Hezbollah? It [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=163.5s)]
*  is erupting and it has erupted for the past year. And now the Israelis are [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=168.54s)]
*  striking the Lebanese capital. They are in southern Lebanon on the ground. But [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=172.46s)]
*  the second question is, what are they going to do with the tens of thousands [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=176.38s)]
*  of Americans who will be looking to evacuate Lebanon? We have seen a number [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=179.58s)]
*  of people online talking about the fact that they've reached out to the State [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=184.06s)]
*  Department telling them there are no flights. All the flights are booked. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=187.78s)]
*  Flights are getting canceled. And the Americans say we will reimburse you for [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=191.06s)]
*  a loan, not to actually pay for the flights, but to just offer people a [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=195.58s)]
*  loan for plane tickets that cost thousands of dollars that actually [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=199.26000000000002s)]
*  aren't even available at this point. And so it's a major catastrophe in the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=202.78s)]
*  making. And it's something that the Biden administration is going to have [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=206.9s)]
*  to address as this war develops and the conflict possibly expands even in the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=210.06s)]
*  next few hours. And Vice President Kamala Harris is on the move all over [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=214.66000000000003s)]
*  the country at campaign events. Perhaps she can use that bully pulpit to [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=218.18s)]
*  address it. We'll hold our breath. Trey Yanks, thank you very much. Great [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=221.58s)]
*  reporting always. Ari, I mean, I always look to see how we left Americans [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=225.24s)]
*  behind. We left them behind in Afghanistan. We knew that this was a [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=231.16s)]
*  problem when Israel first got attacked a year ago next week now, October 7th, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=236.24s)]
*  got attacked by the Hamas savages. And we needed to get Americans out of harm's [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=241.24s)]
*  way at that point as Israel went to war. Yet people had the same problem. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=245.44s)]
*  Kayleigh and I talked about it. They can't get out. They can't afford to take [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=250.28s)]
*  these flights. We were slow in sending boats and things to go get them. Come [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=253.12s)]
*  on. My hunch is what's driving a lot of this is faith in Israel by the United [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=257.6s)]
*  States government and military that they believe this is a limited excursion into [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=261.96s)]
*  southern Lebanon, where Israel will not get closer to the American population, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=265.32s)]
*  which is more based around Beirut and other northern locations and precise [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=268.92s)]
*  bombing abilities of Israel to hit the military targets without going after [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=273.8s)]
*  other civilian neighborhoods. That is likely what is happening here. That's, I [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=278.08s)]
*  otherwise I think the United States would have tried to evacuate Americans. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=283.20000000000005s)]
*  But what about the Americans in Israel? Similar thinking. They believe that [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=286.52000000000004s)]
*  they're safe there because of Israel's military defensive capabilities. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=290.20000000000005s)]
*  Otherwise, you'd have even more Americans to evacuate from from the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=293.40000000000003s)]
*  state of Israel. Look, I was told by a military authority in a position to [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=296.72s)]
*  know after the Iranian attack earlier with their 300 missiles that Iran [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=301.52000000000004s)]
*  didn't use their best missiles against Israel. They used some of their older [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=305.56s)]
*  technology. If that's the case and Iran has more sophisticated weaponry and [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=309.0s)]
*  they do specifically missiles, this will be a test for Israel's defense system [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=313.44s)]
*  and America's defense system. I suspect strongly Israel and America are up to [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=317.88s)]
*  the test. Two things. We are in kind of a different generation now where they [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=321.6s)]
*  like to take people, hostages. So I am concerned about Americans on the [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=324.72s)]
*  ground, not because Israel can't fight tremendously well, but because Hezbollah [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=328.44s)]
*  is dirty and they're terrorists and I don't want anybody being taken. The [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=332.8s)]
*  second is that aero system that that handles those higher altitude weapons. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=336.64s)]
*  Congresswoman Nass was telling me about this last hour, Kayleigh. They may have to [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=340.56s)]
*  use something more than just the Iron Dome for the very reason that Ari just [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=344.84s)]
*  mentioned. Iran likely has some things we haven't seen yet. They do and [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=348.88s)]
*  Israel, unfortunately, yes they have the support of the United States. Yes, they [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=352.59999999999997s)]
*  have the support of the Western world, but it's not the full support of the [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=356.96s)]
*  United States. We should be unequivocally standing with Israel, not saying cease [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=359.82s)]
*  fire, standing with Israel. Because to your point, we are not even at the one [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=365.44s)]
*  year anniversary of October 7th. More than a thousand citizens ripped from [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=370.04s)]
*  their home. I'll never forget Shiri Bebis holding her two little boys with their [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=373.32s)]
*  little red heads, Kefir Bebis, Ariel Bebis, who we don't know where they are. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=377.32s)]
*  First birthday in captivity, okay? And then when you look at northern Israel [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=381.08s)]
*  and you look over the border at Hezbollah, they were planning another [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=385.96s)]
*  October 7th style attack and for our country to say cease fire now, no. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=389.52s)]
*  Defend your borders, protect yourselves, stand with this country. My gosh, as Iran [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=394.78s)]
*  is looking to target them, because guess what? Iran's gonna target you next. They [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=401.41999999999996s)]
*  are not stopping until there's a commander-in-chief who has Middle East [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=405.34s)]
*  peace deals, who assassinates their top general. Oh wait, we had that. That was [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=408.34s)]
*  Donald Trump with Soleimani. They will not stop. We have a president at a very [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=411.7s)]
*  scary time in our country's history, in our world, and I don't know what he's [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=415.85999999999996s)]
*  doing right now other than saying ceasefire. Well, we don't know what the [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=419.65999999999997s)]
*  vice president would do and she wants his job. Like I don't even know what her [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=422.5s)]
*  foreign policy is on this and she's too shy to say really full-throatedly, as you [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=425.7s)]
*  pointed out, how much she supports Israel because she's got to get that [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=429.76s)]
*  uncommitted crowd of voters in Minnesota and Michigan and other places. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=433.06s)]
*  Cheryl? Well, I mean look, I'm gonna say I'm gonna quote the Wall Street Journal [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=436.38s)]
*  editorial board when it comes to now is the moment for this country and our [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=439.38s)]
*  ally Israel, not only to stand with our ally Israel but also the response for [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=442.78s)]
*  the US and Europe build on Israel's military breakthrough, put more pressure [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=447.14s)]
*  on Iran and its proxy network. One thing that Iran does not want to lose right [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=451.26s)]
*  now, that's 40 billion dollars in annual revenue that they get from oil exports. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ&t=456.5s)]
