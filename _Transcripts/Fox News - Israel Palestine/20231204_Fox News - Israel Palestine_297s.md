# Doctor treating freed Hamas hostages describes the unprecedented abuse
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg)
*  Good people are always pleased when innocent victims are spared. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=0.0s)]
*  But how do we balance the joy that some hostages have been released with the reality that it [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=4.04s)]
*  was barbaric to take them in the first place? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=8.64s)]
*  How do we temper the good news of freedom for some while remembering many are still [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=12.02s)]
*  in captivity? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=17.48s)]
*  And what is the psychology of victimhood? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=18.48s)]
*  How do you see depravity up close and personal and not be forever marred by it? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=22.14s)]
*  How do you rejoice in the safety of a four-year-old child without forgetting who made her an orphan [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=27.8s)]
*  in the first place? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=33.8s)]
*  Joining us now is Dr. Renana Etan, who is treating freed hostages at the Tel Aviv Medical [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=35.8s)]
*  Center. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=41.52s)]
*  Welcome, doctor. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=42.52s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=43.52s)]
*  There are physical needs and there are emotional, psychological needs that might be very difficult [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  to see. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=49.28s)]
*  So how do you find those kinds of injuries? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=50.28s)]
*  Hi, so thank you for your kind invitation. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=54.8s)]
*  And it's very encouraging to know that you're interested in what is happening now in Israel. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=58.8s)]
*  We have been treating over 15 patients who came back from the Hamas captivity at the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=66.75999999999999s)]
*  Tel Aviv Medical Center. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=73.72s)]
*  And I can tell you that on behalf of all the medical and psychological teams treating those [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=75.0s)]
*  who returned, the mental states we encounter have no precedent in medical literature. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=80.42s)]
*  We feel that we have to rewrite the textbooks of post-trauma. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=90.54s)]
*  You have to remember that as far as we know, the Red Cross has not visited nor assisted [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=95.38s)]
*  those who were held captive. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=101.22s)]
*  And there is evidence of severe physical and mental abuse. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=103.58s)]
*  Those held captive were subject to starvation, to beating, to sexual abuse. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=109.02s)]
*  They were being held in inhumane sanitary conditions. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=115.16s)]
*  Extremely severe psychological abuse was inflicted on them, including separation from family [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=119.98s)]
*  members, separation of siblings, separations of children from their mothers. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=126.62s)]
*  They were held in solitary confinement and spent long days in total darkness until they [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=133.64000000000001s)]
*  developed severe hallucinations. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=139.18s)]
*  Children were forced to watch brutal videos. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=142.4s)]
*  They were under constant threats by weapons and threats to harm them, even after they [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=145.70000000000002s)]
*  were released. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=151.56s)]
*  They report the use of forced use of psychiatric drugs and other substances. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=152.56s)]
*  It is clear to us now that we must act to release all of the hostages as soon as possible, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=161.32s)]
*  since the cruel abuse of them and the captivity of Hamas is inhumane and intolerable. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=168.84s)]
*  We have indications that some of the hostages are in a bad mental state and might even hurt [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=175.02s)]
*  themselves. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=181.28s)]
*  So we now start with an integrative physical and mental rehabilitation action that are [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=182.68s)]
*  required in the treatment of those who were released from the captivity. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=188.92s)]
*  Some of the homecomers, they look happy. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=194.1s)]
*  They look fine. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=196.83999999999997s)]
*  They look physically fine. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=197.83999999999997s)]
*  And we try to hold on to those optimistic signs. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=199.76s)]
*  But still, even those who seem fine, we know that most of them suffer from severe post-traumatic [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=203.42s)]
*  symptoms. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=210.88s)]
*  They have painful traumatic memories and they are entering into dissociative states where [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=212.38s)]
*  for a moment they feel as if they were still in captivity and only later do they return [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=217.92s)]
*  to the understanding that they have been released. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=223.51999999999998s)]
*  They experience difficulties falling asleep and staying asleep and suffer from nightmares [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=226.76s)]
*  at night. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=232.06s)]
*  They report paralyzing fear and hypersensitivity to any sound or trigger that reminds them [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=233.23999999999998s)]
*  of their time in captivity. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=240.11999999999998s)]
*  And some of them have already developed depression and psychosis. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=242.16s)]
*  You know, Doctor, it is not just being in captivity, which is bad enough. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=247.92s)]
*  Being kidnapped and held in captivity is bad enough. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=256.0s)]
*  But what some of these folks saw before they were taken captive, the barbarism, the heinous [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=258.71999999999997s)]
*  nature of what Hamas did, these are unseen injuries and for some it will be a lifelong [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=265.44s)]
*  sentence. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=272.4s)]
*  Their victimhood will be a lifelong sentence. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=274.24s)]
*  Thank you, Doctor, for treating them and taking care of them and we'd love to have you back [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=276.4s)]
*  to check on their progress. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=280.79999999999995s)]
*  Thank you for joining us on a Sunday night. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00FgWdI9axg&t=283.47999999999996s)]
