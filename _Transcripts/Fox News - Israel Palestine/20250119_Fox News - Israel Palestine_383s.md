# President Biden addresses the release of 3 Israeli hostages following cease-fire deal
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [January 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg)
*  So we want to bring in our stations from across the nation to join us from Charleston, South [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=0.0s)]
*  Carolina on what will be his second to last day in office. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=5.4s)]
*  Four more women will be released in seven days, three additional hostages every seven [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=12.48s)]
*  days thereafter, including the least two American citizens in this first phase. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=16.64s)]
*  We pray for them and their families for their going to be a long recovery ahead. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=22.28s)]
*  By the 16th day of the deal, talks will begin in the second phase. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=27.24s)]
*  This phase includes the release of Israeli soldiers and a permanent end of the war without [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=31.72s)]
*  Hamas in power or able to threaten Israel. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=37.44s)]
*  Hundreds of trucks are entering Gaza as I speak. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=41.68s)]
*  They're carrying assistance for civilians who suffered enormously from the war that [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=44.68s)]
*  Hamas started on October 7th, 2023, nearly 15 months ago. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=48.8s)]
*  Today alone, we anticipate several hundred trucks will enter the Gaza Strip as I'm [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=54.44s)]
*  probably as I'm speaking. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=59.04s)]
*  And after so much pain, destruction, loss of life, today the guns in Gaza have gone silent. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=60.760000000000005s)]
*  This was the deal that I outlined for the world back in May 31st. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=67.08s)]
*  Many of you covered it at the time. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=70.92s)]
*  I was endorsed overwhelmingly by folks around the world, including the UN Security Council, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=73.0s)]
*  who unanimously endorsed the deal and developed a coordination with Egypt, Qatar and Israel. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=79.68s)]
*  I've worked in foreign policy for decades, and this is one of the toughest negotiations [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=87.80000000000001s)]
*  I've been part of. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  Many of you who follow these negotiations will attest that the road to this deal has [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=94.12s)]
*  been not easy at all and a long road. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  But we've reached this point today because of the pressure Israel built on Hamas backed [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  by the United States. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=106.04s)]
*  Some said my policy of a firm support for Israel is relentlessly pursuing diplomacy, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=108.12s)]
*  risk drawing America into a wider war in the region. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  I listened to those voices, many of whom I respected a great deal, but I concluded abandoning [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=116.56s)]
*  the course I was on would not have led us to the ceasefire we're seeing today. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=121.44s)]
*  But instead, it would have risked a wider war in the region that so many feared. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=127.36000000000001s)]
*  Now the region has been fundamentally transformed. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=132.64000000000001s)]
*  Hamas' longtime leader Sinemar is dead. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=135.72s)]
*  Hamas' sponsors in the Middle East have been badly weakened by Israel, backed by the United States. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=138.92s)]
*  Hezbollah, one of Hamas' biggest backers, was significantly weakened in the battlefield [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=145.23999999999998s)]
*  and its leadership was destroyed. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=150.39999999999998s)]
*  Even as we worked for diplomatic solutions in Lebanon, we provided ongoing assistance [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=152.51999999999998s)]
*  to support Israel's military campaign against Hezbollah, including its efforts to take out [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=157.5s)]
*  the terror infrastructure along the border between Israel and Lebanon. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=163.79999999999998s)]
*  Israel's campaign was extremely successful, so much so that by the end of November, the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=167.51999999999998s)]
*  United States had brokered a ceasefire in Lebanon. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=173.6s)]
*  Hezbollah did what it said it would never do. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=177.28s)]
*  It cut its deal and abandoned Hamas. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  And today, Lebanon, in Lebanon, there's finally a new president and prime minister, both of [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=184.39999999999998s)]
*  whom support a sovereign Lebanon without Hezbollah running the show or playing any part in it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=189.56s)]
*  The Assad regime next door in Syria is gone, removing Iran's ready access to Lebanon. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=196.56s)]
*  Iran is in the weakest position in decades after the U.S. military helped defend Israel [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=203.56s)]
*  from Iranian missiles and supported Israel's military response inside Iran. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=209.64s)]
*  Just look across the region. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=214.51999999999998s)]
*  In Lebanon, there's an opportunity for a future free from the grip of Hezbollah. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=216.2s)]
*  In Syria, a future free from the Assad, the tyranny of Assad. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=221.11999999999998s)]
*  For the Palestinian people, a credible path to a state of their own. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=226.23999999999998s)]
*  For the region and the future normalization and integration of Israel with all its Arab [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=230.6s)]
*  neighbors, including Saudi Arabia, which I've spoken with. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=235.44s)]
*  You know, we've had many difficult days since Hamas began this terrible war. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=238.23999999999998s)]
*  We've encountered roadblocks and setbacks, but we haven't given up. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=242.60000000000002s)]
*  A special thanks to my team, particularly Brett McGurk, who many of you know, who spent [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=247.24s)]
*  weeks and months working nonstop to reach this deal, many of those weeks and months [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=251.88000000000002s)]
*  out of the country. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=256.8s)]
*  Today ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages is a result of a principled and effective [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=259.0s)]
*  policy that we presided over for months. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=264.72s)]
*  And we got here without a wider war in the Middle East than many predicted. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=268.84s)]
*  And now it falls on the next administration to help implement this deal. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=273.08s)]
*  I was pleased to have our team speak as one voice in the final days. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=277.2s)]
*  It was both necessary and effective and unprecedented. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=281.15999999999997s)]
*  But success is going to require persistence and continuing support for our friends in [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=284.71999999999997s)]
*  the region and the belief in diplomacy backed by deterrence. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=289.79999999999995s)]
*  So as we reflect on the news from Gaza today, we also remember all the victims of this war. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=294.16s)]
*  They were mindful, they're mindful that the pursuit of a lasting peace while never easy [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=301.04s)]
*  or quick must always be our calling. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=306.08000000000004s)]
*  So thank you all for listening. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=308.64000000000004s)]
*  May God bless you all. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=310.6s)]
*  May God protect our troops. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=311.6s)]
*  I'm looking forward to this deal being fully implemented. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=312.76000000000005s)]
*  And I'm sorry I'm not going to take any questions now because I'm waiting. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=315.68s)]
*  There's a whole congregation waiting for me and I'm sure the remainder of the day I'll [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=318.68s)]
*  have an opportunity to speak with you. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=322.44000000000005s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=324.04s)]
*  And is there anything about the condition of the hostages that were released today and [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=325.04s)]
*  the others that were taken? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=327.88s)]
*  Yes, I've just got a call saying the three are released into Gaza to the, out of the [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=328.88s)]
*  hands of their captors. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=337.52s)]
*  And they appear to be in good health, but it's early to tell. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=340.96s)]
*  They're literally being, they may be across the border out of the Gaza Strip into Israel [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=343.52s)]
*  now, I'm not certain. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=348.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=350.56s)]
*  Any concerns about the hostage group? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=351.56s)]
*  No. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=353.56s)]
*  Will you remain involved in the deal? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=354.56s)]
*  Okay, so the first move. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=358.04s)]
*  No way out. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=359.68s)]
*  Stand by. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=360.68s)]
*  The first move and the first phase of the hostage deal has taken place. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=361.68s)]
*  There are many moving parts on this. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=366.88s)]
*  And as the president said, on the 16th day of the first phase of the deal, negotiations [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=368.4s)]
*  for the second phase will get underway. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=373.64s)]
*  It's complicated. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=376.04s)]
*  But three Israeli women have been returned home as of now. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=377.08s)]
*  We await for a lot more to come. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaF37IunPHg&t=381.24s)]
