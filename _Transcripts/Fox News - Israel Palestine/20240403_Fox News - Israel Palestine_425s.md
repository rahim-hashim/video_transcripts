# Tammy Bruce: This is not the way Americans want to live
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w)
*  President Biden's shift in his words and tone toward Israel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=0.0s)]
*  are a political nightmare for him. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=4.0s)]
*  Even Hamas savages say he shifted his policy [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=5.68s)]
*  to support Israel less. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  You know the terrorists like that. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=10.72s)]
*  Primary season voters in several states [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=12.56s)]
*  are increasingly checking the uncommitted box on the ballot. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=14.6s)]
*  They turned out and forced to vote yesterday [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=18.16s)]
*  in Wisconsin's primary, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=20.36s)]
*  puts it this way in a headline, Wisconsin's uninstructed [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  delegation, voters more than double Biden's 2020 margin. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=26.6s)]
*  And by the way, in that state, they call the uncommitted [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=31.160000000000004s)]
*  the uninstructed. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=33.44s)]
*  It's all the same. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=35.08s)]
*  Grassroots groups are urging those people [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=36.0s)]
*  to stick with Biden over his handling of the Israel-Hamas [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=38.04s)]
*  war. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=41.72s)]
*  I think the Democratic Party has lost all legitimacy [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=43.92s)]
*  in our communities. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=47.88s)]
*  If in November we still don't have a ceasefire, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=49.32s)]
*  I don't know what will be left in Gaza. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=52.84s)]
*  And that's our focus in this campaign. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=56.16s)]
*  And now that's interesting. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=59.68s)]
*  So is this just really a protest vote [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  or would they vote for somebody else? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=62.8s)]
*  She's going to give them all the way to November [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=64.44s)]
*  to make things different. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=66.56s)]
*  Well, a lot of things can change between now and November. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=67.92s)]
*  So Biden hoes. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=70.56s)]
*  Team Biden desperately is trying to get a grip [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=72.12s)]
*  on the uncommitted problem. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=74.2s)]
*  Democratic voters in 15 states, look at the map, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=76.44s)]
*  have already skipped inking his name on primary ballots. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=78.96s)]
*  Our panel, Tammy Bruce, Fox News contributor [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=83.0s)]
*  and Richard Fowler, Forbes contributing writer. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=85.12s)]
*  So Tammy, I thought that was interesting. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=87.36s)]
*  That's a lot of time to give the president on an issue [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=89.48s)]
*  that he really doesn't have a whole lot of control over. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=92.52000000000001s)]
*  I mean, Israel is not listening to him. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=95.64s)]
*  Yes, but they've seen Biden shift, as you've noticed. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=97.68s)]
*  So has Hamas. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=101.12s)]
*  So has Hamas. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=102.08000000000001s)]
*  So that would explain the dramatic shift. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=103.04s)]
*  And this is, of course, look, as a former community organizer, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=105.76s)]
*  I'm impressed with the messaging that they're managing to do [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=108.4s)]
*  with this non-committal, non-voting dynamic. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=112.0s)]
*  But it's not even whether or not they'll vote for someone else [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=115.36s)]
*  if they don't vote. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=118.36s)]
*  Effectively, it's a vote for Biden. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=119.72s)]
*  When you've got Wisconsin, which Biden won by about 21,000 votes, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=121.76s)]
*  that is a significant dynamic. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=126.4s)]
*  But I would suggest, Richard may disagree with me, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=127.96000000000001s)]
*  that if you're governing on a value system [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=130.8s)]
*  and you're consistent and people know [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=134.16s)]
*  what you stand for as a whole, as opposed to, let's say, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=136.0s)]
*  at the buffet line, where you're going to adjust yourself [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=138.72s)]
*  based on what's happening in the moment, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=141.92s)]
*  none of the constituency then can trust [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=144.16s)]
*  what it is you're going to do. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=146.32s)]
*  But I would suggest that perhaps, as November approaches, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=147.72s)]
*  while some people, obviously in that constituency, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=151.11999999999998s)]
*  are worried about Gaza, they're probably [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=153.83999999999997s)]
*  going to be more likely worried about their own economy, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=156.56s)]
*  the dynamic of what's happening here [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=159.16s)]
*  in the United States of America, which [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=160.72s)]
*  controls the nature of their families and their future. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=162.72s)]
*  So she called your name. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=165.95999999999998s)]
*  Would you like to respond? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=167.95999999999998s)]
*  Well, listen, I actually tend to agree with Tammy on that point. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=169.67999999999998s)]
*  I do think that as we get closer and closer to actually voting [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=172.39999999999998s)]
*  in November, which is a long way from now, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=176.6s)]
*  even though it seems like we're moving very fast, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  I think that the main issue will shift here. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=182.35999999999999s)]
*  And I also think that, as we all know, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=184.51999999999998s)]
*  we've seen many of these conflicts before, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=186.2s)]
*  even though I will argue that this conflict in Israel and Gaza [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=187.79999999999998s)]
*  is a lot different than previous ones, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=190.04s)]
*  we do know the dynamics on the ground [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=191.67999999999998s)]
*  will also shift over time. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=193.27999999999997s)]
*  And I think, Harris, you talked about this early on your show. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  I think the language you see coming from the White House [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=198.64s)]
*  around the strong language after the killing of those seven aid [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=200.95999999999998s)]
*  workers about outrage from the president, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=203.64s)]
*  that word outrage is the strongest language [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=206.23999999999998s)]
*  we've seen from the president. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=208.2s)]
*  And I don't think he can control what the Israeli government does. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=209.88s)]
*  But I think that, coupled with the fact [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=212.83999999999997s)]
*  that you see anti-government protests taking place [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=214.51999999999998s)]
*  in Tel Aviv, taking place in Jerusalem, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=216.95999999999998s)]
*  where Israelis are saying, we have a problem with how [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  the Bibi Netanyahu government's conducting their policies, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  could see a ceasefire by the summertime. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=223.95999999999998s)]
*  Well, that's not exactly what they're saying. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=225.95999999999998s)]
*  And if you were watching, you saw the two parents [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=227.24s)]
*  that we had on who is their son is one of the five Americans [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=229.20000000000002s)]
*  being held. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=232.20000000000002s)]
*  What they're saying is they need for Netanyahu [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=232.84s)]
*  to hurry up and do a deal to get those hostages home. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=235.0s)]
*  They have not called for a ceasefire, nor would they. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=237.44s)]
*  They want that to happen. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=240.12s)]
*  If he can't do that, then he needs to go. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=241.4s)]
*  Can I add something? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=243.52s)]
*  I want to make sure that we get the facts right [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=244.56s)]
*  on that protest. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=246.28s)]
*  Tammy, real quick, and we'll move. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=247.0s)]
*  If he's moving to quell those particular segments [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=248.56s)]
*  of the constituencies that want change there [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=253.0s)]
*  and are supporting a ceasefire or not, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=255.64s)]
*  the fact is he's losing independence. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=259.44s)]
*  So there's a whole bunch of other Americans here [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=261.64s)]
*  who do not like this going after. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=264.08s)]
*  Do not like going after an ally, that this is about Hamas [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=267.0s)]
*  starting a war. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=271.52s)]
*  So you get kind of backed into a corner there, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=272.71999999999997s)]
*  and he's forgetting the nature of the fact [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=276.12s)]
*  that it's going to be independents, really, who [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=278.15999999999997s)]
*  decide this election. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=280.0s)]
*  All right, let's get to this. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=281.36s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal poll shows [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=282.52s)]
*  that former President Trump leads President Biden [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=284.16s)]
*  in six battleground states, with the two tied at 46% [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=286.76000000000005s)]
*  in the seventh swing state in Wisconsin. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=292.08000000000004s)]
*  They're both hit in that state, by the way, in recent days. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=295.64000000000004s)]
*  So Richard, look at these numbers [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=298.96000000000004s)]
*  and tell me where you think the pressure points are [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=300.72s)]
*  on Joe Biden. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=305.16s)]
*  Well, look, I think that there's a point that Tammy made [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=306.92s)]
*  that I think is right. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=309.12s)]
*  I think, and she said earlier in the segment, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=309.96000000000004s)]
*  I think the idea of the economy is [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=311.8s)]
*  going to be a big pressure point for this president, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=313.12s)]
*  I think, as we get closer. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=315.08s)]
*  Do you know why inflation has been so stubborn? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=316.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, you saw the Secretary of the Treasury say, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=318.0s)]
*  she never should have said that it was transitory. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=322.76s)]
*  It's really sticking. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=326.0s)]
*  We're still above 3% at this point, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=327.36s)]
*  and we don't want to be there after 8% and 9% [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=329.92s)]
*  over a two-year period. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=333.04s)]
*  It's a bad place to be. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=334.08s)]
*  Do you know why that is and why Biden can't message better [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=335.08s)]
*  on that? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=337.92s)]
*  Listen, I do think he needs to message better on that, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=338.52s)]
*  but I think there's also something that's happening. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=340.28000000000003s)]
*  Or fix it. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=341.6s)]
*  During the State of the Union, I got a chance [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=342.72s)]
*  to watch it with a bunch of undecided voters. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=344.08000000000004s)]
*  And the biggest applause line that I heard from those [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=346.24s)]
*  when I reported this in Forbes was when the president said [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=348.40000000000003s)]
*  he will cap credit card late fees to $8 per month, right? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=350.88000000000005s)]
*  Most folks are paying $32, $40 a month, small things like that. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=355.72s)]
*  When the president goes out and talks about, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=358.76000000000005s)]
*  here's what I've done for you. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=360.38000000000005s)]
*  Here's how I've made your personal economy, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=361.6s)]
*  your kitchen table a little bit easier, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=363.34000000000003s)]
*  those are the issues that move undecided voters. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=365.32000000000005s)]
*  The room erupted into applause, and I [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=367.88000000000005s)]
*  think that is what the president needs [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=369.52000000000004s)]
*  to talk about more and more as we get into the campaign. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=370.76000000000005s)]
*  That's pretty sad, though, when you're dealing with [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=372.28s)]
*  the 40 dollars a month for a late fee is pretty sad, too, Tammy. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=374.28s)]
*  Anticipating people who have not put everything [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=376.91999999999996s)]
*  on the credit card and still can't pay that bill. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=380.0s)]
*  That's what he's talking about. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=383.03999999999996s)]
*  This is not the way Americans want to live. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=384.47999999999996s)]
*  Well, to you both, a great discussion. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=388.0s)]
*  We will watch every second of it. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=390.23999999999995s)]
*  And Wisconsin is just getting a lot of love right now. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=391.71999999999997s)]
*  That's it. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=394.08s)]
*  I imagine all seven of those states. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=394.76s)]
*  Maybe the three of us should go at some point together, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=396.76s)]
*  and we can all talk to undecided voters together [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=399.11999999999995s)]
*  and see what we want. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=401.88s)]
*  Cheese curds for all. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=402.71999999999997s)]
*  I love it. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=403.56s)]
*  I love cheese curds. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=404.0s)]
*  I also love talk to voters. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=404.92s)]
*  That's a win-win, baby. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=406.12s)]
*  OK, thank you. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAYI96fW6w&t=407.76s)]
