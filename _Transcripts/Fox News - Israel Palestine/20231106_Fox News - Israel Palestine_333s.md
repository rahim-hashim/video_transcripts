# This is Hamas' diabolical strategy: Jack Keane
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c)
*  Let's bring in General Jacque now sir, good morning to you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you for your time. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=2.98s)]
*  There's a lot to cover here. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=3.98s)]
*  We'll try and get in as much as we can. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=4.98s)]
*  Want to show you video evidence that the Israeli Defense Forces have made public. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=6.66s)]
*  This was made public on Sunday. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=11.72s)]
*  They believe what it shows, General, is how this tunnel right there on the ground, circled [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=13.14s)]
*  in red, leads underneath a hospital. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=18.1s)]
*  And this is to say what they're up against when it comes to civilian targets. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=20.66s)]
*  I want you to comment on that and I want you to tell me in your view, does Hamas think [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=24.54s)]
*  they're doing well in this battle right now? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=29.38s)]
*  And do you think they are doing well thus far? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=32.94s)]
*  Or are they on the brink of elimination? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=36.9s)]
*  Well first of all, there's no doubt that they weaponize civilian structures, hospitals, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=41.86s)]
*  schools, mosques, to obviously shield themselves from Israeli attacks. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=46.379999999999995s)]
*  They have done this from their inception and their sophistication has likely increased [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=51.2s)]
*  with now 300 miles estimated of tunnels that are underneath these facilities. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=56.14s)]
*  When you look at Hamas and where they think they are, a couple of things. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=61.96s)]
*  They're going to use the hostages, one, to get a ceasefire and two, to get all the Israelis [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=65.8s)]
*  out of Gaza. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=70.4s)]
*  So they want to fight again and they're using the hostages certainly to protect the lives [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  of their leadership and they'll use them also to protect a lot of their infrastructures. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=77.26s)]
*  Remains to be seen what will happen as a result of those negotiations. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=82.12s)]
*  That's likely their aims. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=86.5s)]
*  When they conducted this brutal attack, they focused on civilians, Bill. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=88.17999999999999s)]
*  And what was the reason for that? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=92.58s)]
*  One, they wanted to undermine the people's confidence in Israel, in their leadership [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=93.74s)]
*  and its ability to protect them. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=97.89999999999999s)]
*  I think they accomplished that. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=99.46s)]
*  Number two, they wanted a very violent response. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=101.82s)]
*  This is sinister, it's diabolical to think this way, but this is the way they think. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=105.08s)]
*  They wanted the casualties that we are seeing taking place now because of the Israeli response. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=109.98s)]
*  Despite their attempt to protect civilian casualties, Hamas has held in place hundreds [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=115.9s)]
*  of thousands of Gazans refusing to permit them to go because they want them to become [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=121.9s)]
*  casualties. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=127.5s)]
*  And why? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=128.5s)]
*  You can see it. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=130.06s)]
*  They want widespread international condemnation of Israel. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=131.06s)]
*  And that is taking place. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=136.82s)]
*  They want Israel to be isolated geopolitically and be weakened on a world stage. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=138.38s)]
*  It remains to be seen whether that will take place or not. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=146.66s)]
*  They want to stop the normalization of relationships with the Arabs and the Israelis. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=149.62s)]
*  Certainly that's going to be delayed, but hopefully it will not end. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=155.02s)]
*  And I think they want to form a political collapse inside of Israel with the government [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=158.98000000000002s)]
*  because of a loss of confidence of what took place and also how the entire international [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=164.76s)]
*  community is beginning to isolate them. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=170.72s)]
*  Those are some of the strategic goals I think Hamas is attempting to achieve. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=174.52s)]
*  They've obviously achieved some of them. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=179.36s)]
*  They clearly did not do this operation so the Israelis could come in and exterminate [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=182.12s)]
*  them. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=187.8s)]
*  So they're going to do everything they can to prevent that from happening because Hamas [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=188.8s)]
*  always wants to re-attack again. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=192.16s)]
*  And they'll use those hostages, I think, as a guarantor that that will likely happen. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=195.24s)]
*  There's a lot to take place in front of us. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=200.96s)]
*  It's going to take months to work through those tunnel complexes, I believe, to get [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  to a point where you're even close to dismantling this organization. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=208.12s)]
*  But at that time, they'll likely play the hostage card. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=214.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=217.88s)]
*  General, let me just try and squeeze in a few more headlines. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=218.88s)]
*  Trey Yanks is reporting today, his sources tell him that they believe most of the hostages [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=221.0s)]
*  are still in the same central area in Gaza City. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=225.28s)]
*  That may or may not be the case. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=228.4s)]
*  That's what the Israelis believe at the moment. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=230.08s)]
*  We have a U.S. guided missile submarine that's now moving toward the eastern Mediterranean. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=232.48s)]
*  It's rare when we make that information public. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=238.56s)]
*  You've got Anthony Blinken. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=241.12s)]
*  He was making the rounds over the weekend. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=242.4s)]
*  He was in Baghdad, Iraq. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=244.12s)]
*  He was in the West Bank meeting with Palestinian leadership there. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=246.28s)]
*  He was in Turkey trying to calm the waters on behalf of Ankara and Istanbul. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=249.28s)]
*  Sir, I just need a quick answer here. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=253.2s)]
*  Is this effective in containing this conflict today? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=256.08s)]
*  It appears so far, yes, because we listened to Nasrallah, the head of the Hezbollah in [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=263.34s)]
*  Lebanon, and certainly he was threatening the use of more force, but he obviously hasn't [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=269.6s)]
*  pulled that trigger. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=274.04s)]
*  I think there's a certain reluctance for them to do that because of the economic situation [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=275.72s)]
*  and the empowerment that's taking place among his own people. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=281.40000000000003s)]
*  He knows full well, with the might of the United States out there being very physically [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=285.04s)]
*  displayed, if Israel wants that to help them, if he unleashes his 130,000 missiles on Israel [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=290.68s)]
*  and they need U.S. firepower, they will get U.S. firepower. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=297.72s)]
*  This submarine that you're talking about is very different. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=302.6s)]
*  We only have four of them. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=305.0s)]
*  They're SSGNs. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=306.64s)]
*  They used to be nuclear ballistic missile-carrying submarines. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=307.88s)]
*  We converted those four so that they could carry Tomahawk submarines, took the nuclear [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=311.84s)]
*  ballistic missiles out of them as part of the reduction of nuclear treaties that took [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=316.96s)]
*  place. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=321.32s)]
*  Very, very powerful instrument of war, to be frank about it. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=322.32s)]
*  No other country in the world has anything like what's sitting out there, and that's [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=327.15999999999997s)]
*  why we're advertising it. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=330.64s)]
*  General, thank you. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxsZFY7kT8c&t=332.24s)]
