# Trump says 'epic' cease-fire is result of his 2024 victory: 'PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH'
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI)
*  The incoming president just posted on his Truth Social. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=0.0s)]
*  This epic ceasefire agreement could only have happened [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  as a result of our historic victory in November, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=6.88s)]
*  as it signaled to the entire world [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=10.24s)]
*  that my administration would seek peace [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=12.16s)]
*  and negotiate deals to ensure the safety [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  of all Americans and our allies. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=17.2s)]
*  I am thrilled American and Israeli hostages [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=19.8s)]
*  will be returning home to be reunited [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=22.52s)]
*  with their families and loved ones. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=24.64s)]
*  With this deal in place, my national security team [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=26.84s)]
*  through the efforts of Special Envoy [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=30.16s)]
*  to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=31.92s)]
*  will continue to work closely with Israel and our allies [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=33.88s)]
*  to make sure Gaza never, all caps, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  again becomes a terrorist safe haven. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=41.32s)]
*  We will continue promoting, again, all caps, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=45.04s)]
*  peace through strength throughout the region [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  as we build upon the momentum of the ceasefire [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=50.96s)]
*  to further expand the historic Abraham Accords. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=53.72s)]
*  This is only the beginning of great things to come [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=57.28s)]
*  in America and indeed the world. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=60.2s)]
*  We have achieved so much without even being in the White House. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=62.4s)]
*  Just imagine all the wonderful things that will happen [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=65.2s)]
*  when I return to the White House [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=67.64s)]
*  and my administration is fully confirmed [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=69.44s)]
*  so they can secure more victories to the United States. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=72.44s)]
*  Before we go to our next guest, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=76.68s)]
*  I want to ask to hear from potentially [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  the incoming Secretary of State at his very own hearing today [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=80.64s)]
*  was asked about Gaza and the war there. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=84.92s)]
*  Let's watch Marco Rubio on a potential hostage deal. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=88.56s)]
*  Do you agree that a permanent ceasefire in Gaza [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=93.6s)]
*  must include, absolutely must include [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=96.52s)]
*  the release of those hostages? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=99.12s)]
*  Well, it must include it because if it doesn't, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=100.76s)]
*  there won't be a ceasefire for long. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=104.08s)]
*  That is the linchpin of what's happened. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=105.48s)]
*  Hamas has been severely degraded, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=107.12s)]
*  but these people that include a number of American citizens [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=109.0s)]
*  need to be home as soon as possible [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=111.56s)]
*  and that will remain a priority in any engagement [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=113.28s)]
*  that we're involved in with regards to not just a ceasefire [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=116.08s)]
*  but some permanent peace process moving forward. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=118.8s)]
*  Now, we have been reporting that it is not unlikely [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=122.2s)]
*  that Marco Rubio would become the next Secretary of State. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=126.88s)]
*  He's having a smooth day so far. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=132.12s)]
*  We've been picking up some sound and clips for you [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=134.24s)]
*  and playing those when we can, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=137.28s)]
*  but he is one of six people today [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=138.92000000000002s)]
*  who are in confirmation hearings, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=141.24s)]
*  pulling Trump's vision potentially into place. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=143.12s)]
*  And you see the eminence with which, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=146.28s)]
*  particularly those people who will handle our diplomacy [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  and our fighting forces, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=152.84s)]
*  those people are very important all the time, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=155.24s)]
*  but particularly now if part of this deal [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=158.96s)]
*  is going to release hundreds of killers [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=161.4s)]
*  that we know of as terrorists in the Middle East [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=164.24s)]
*  back onto the open market for themselves. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=166.76000000000002s)]
*  I want to bring in a man who knows this very well. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=169.08s)]
*  He is the former U.S. Ambassador to Israel, David Freeman. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  And Ambassador, you and I were together the day [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=176.52s)]
*  that Donald Trump in his first term [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=178.96s)]
*  moved the embassy importantly from a political location [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=181.52s)]
*  from some in the world to its home city, Jerusalem. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  As you watch this now, tie it all together for me, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=189.68s)]
*  the journey that we've taken in the last 466 days [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=194.12s)]
*  since this war began. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=198.88s)]
*  Well, Harris, thanks for having me. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=202.2s)]
*  And what I would say is that when, God willing, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=203.6s)]
*  that first picture emerges of a hostage [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=206.44s)]
*  being reunited with his or her family, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=210.44s)]
*  I will be in tears, 10 million Israelis will be in tears, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=213.88s)]
*  and probably hundreds of millions of other people [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=219.35999999999999s)]
*  around the world will be in tears. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=223.4s)]
*  It's been that traumatic and difficult, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=224.56s)]
*  and my enduring thanks to my old friend [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=227.32s)]
*  who I knew could do this, President Trump, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=232.0s)]
*  for getting this done. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=233.72s)]
*  It's so important to so many people. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=235.04s)]
*  Look, I want to quote a guest that we had on a few moments ago [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=238.4s)]
*  with Kayleigh Shaharazani. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=242.04s)]
*  He said something that made such an impression on me. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=244.2s)]
*  As long as Hamas is in power, war will never end. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=246.35999999999999s)]
*  So he said whether the ceasefire potentially would last 42 days [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=250.4s)]
*  or whatever it would last, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=254.23999999999998s)]
*  Hamas is going to do what it does until Hamas is no longer. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=256.44s)]
*  I think that's a very important point [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=262.03999999999996s)]
*  because some people, I think, are misinterpreting this [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=263.32s)]
*  as some kind of a capitulation to Hamas [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=265.32s)]
*  or an agreement that Hamas can continue to rule the Gaza Strip. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=268.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, President Trump, first of all, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=272.15999999999997s)]
*  I was hearing his comment just in real time, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=273.64s)]
*  as you put it out. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=277.96s)]
*  He put the words never again in capital letters [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=279.48s)]
*  that never again will Hamas rule the Gaza Strip. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=281.72s)]
*  And I think that's important. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=284.64000000000004s)]
*  And when you think about this team [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=285.76000000000005s)]
*  that President Trump has assembled, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=289.76000000000005s)]
*  of course, his own words themselves. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=291.20000000000005s)]
*  You heard Michael Waltz earlier today [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=293.72s)]
*  say that Hamas has to be decapitated. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=295.24s)]
*  You heard your colleague Pete Hexeth testifying yesterday [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=298.84000000000003s)]
*  that he supported the killing of every single member of Hamas. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=302.84000000000003s)]
*  You heard future Secretary Marco Rubio saying [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=307.36s)]
*  that there'll never be a ceasefire, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=310.44s)]
*  if Hamas stays in power. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=312.2s)]
*  You've got Brian Mast, who's the incoming leader [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=314.28s)]
*  of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=318.36s)]
*  When he was asked, where do you stand on Hamas? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=319.84s)]
*  He said, I stand on their throats. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=322.48s)]
*  So there is no ambiguity here that there's no future [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=324.52s)]
*  for Hamas. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=327.72s)]
*  And frankly, I think it's the recognition by Hamas [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=328.56s)]
*  that their days are numbered, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=330.84s)]
*  that there is no future for them, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=332.68s)]
*  that caused them to make a deal today [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=335.15999999999997s)]
*  that frankly people have thought they agreed to [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=337.28s)]
*  seven months ago, but apparently weren't willing to do. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=339.88s)]
*  So I think this is all because of their recognition [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=342.32s)]
*  that with the incoming administration, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=345.4s)]
*  they have no future. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=346.88s)]
*  Well, they cut it close. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=347.96s)]
*  We're five days away. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=348.92s)]
*  Can you just stay with me for a moment? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=350.64s)]
*  There are two things that are playing out simultaneously [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=352.64s)]
*  that are a little unbelievable. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=354.92s)]
*  So on the left of your screen in Tel Aviv, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=356.4s)]
*  there is the celebration of hope and anticipation [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=358.44s)]
*  that hostages will soon be freed. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=360.96s)]
*  On the right side, they are celebrating in Gaza. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=362.96s)]
*  Let's listen to Gaza for a moment. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=365.48s)]
*  I was told we would have the sound of that. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=369.88s)]
*  Let me know to the team when we do. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=377.36s)]
*  Ambassador Friedman, what are they celebrating? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=380.8s)]
*  I mean, this is probably being sold to them [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=386.12s)]
*  as some sort of a victory. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=389.36s)]
*  And look, it's hard for Israelis to watch the people, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=391.96s)]
*  the Hamas supporters celebrating, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=396.6s)]
*  but that celebration is gonna be short-lived. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=399.16s)]
*  I mean, right now this is about getting the hostages back [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=401.04s)]
*  and Israel's paying a high price to get them back. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=404.36s)]
*  But Israel's not agreeing to end the war. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=407.12s)]
*  Hamas has no future. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=410.16s)]
*  And I'm hoping, I'm skeptical, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=411.48s)]
*  but I'm hoping that maybe some of them [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=415.4s)]
*  were celebrating the possibility [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=417.52s)]
*  that Hamas is coming to an end, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=420.04s)]
*  that with this, Hamas loses this leverage [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=422.12s)]
*  and maybe someone can come in and rule the Gaza Strip, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=424.28000000000003s)]
*  which is less malign. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=427.0s)]
*  But I'm not a very good psychologist [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=429.36s)]
*  into the minds of these people. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=431.92s)]
*  I was hoping to get some audio, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=433.64s)]
*  but now we have a little bit more light on the situation. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=435.28000000000003s)]
*  They are on each other's shoulders and looking jubilant. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=438.2s)]
*  And as you say, wait, we can hear some of it now. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=440.56s)]
*  I want to ask you just real quickly, ambassador, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=443.84s)]
*  if you could understand any of what was being said [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=468.84s)]
*  and if you think that what you think this is now [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=471.24s)]
*  that you can hear some of it. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=474.04s)]
*  I'm not sure, but again, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=477.8s)]
*  their only source of information is what Hamas tells them. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=479.72s)]
*  So maybe they're being told by Hamas because again, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=484.20000000000005s)]
*  this is going to end up being a defeat for Hamas. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=488.40000000000003s)]
*  It may take six weeks, it may take another year [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=490.48s)]
*  before this is all cleaned up, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=493.48s)]
*  but this will end up in a defeat for Hamas. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=494.68s)]
*  Maybe the Hamas is spinning this to their people [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=496.92s)]
*  that somehow they're going to remain in power. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=499.84s)]
*  And maybe that's their narrative, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=503.44s)]
*  but it's going to be short-lived. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=505.84s)]
*  My colleague Charles Payne is here [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=508.47999999999996s)]
*  with a question for you, ambassador. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=510.71999999999997s)]
*  Ambassador, thank you very much. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=512.8s)]
*  The Biden administration initially [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=515.48s)]
*  gave so many mixed signals on this [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=517.4s)]
*  that in many ways I felt, Lisa, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=521.4399999999999s)]
*  as an outside observer, it emboldened Hamas. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=523.76s)]
*  We know President Trump will not do that. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=527.04s)]
*  Will there be a way, you know, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=529.44s)]
*  Santos talks about an avenue [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=530.96s)]
*  for your adversaries to retreat. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=535.0s)]
*  What kind of efforts are being made, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=537.6s)]
*  if you can talk about it, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=539.48s)]
*  to at least find sensible people in Gaza [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=540.92s)]
*  that understand that the path they're on now [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=543.04s)]
*  means total destruction, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=545.08s)]
*  and that if they do want to rise up, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=547.2s)]
*  because there has to be a lot of dissatisfied people there, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=549.88s)]
*  they will get some help from Israel [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=553.08s)]
*  and perhaps the United States [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=555.36s)]
*  so that they can take control of their nation [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=556.96s)]
*  and it's not Hamas who's once again [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=559.2s)]
*  leading them down this path to destruction [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=561.5200000000001s)]
*  where they put hospitals, babies, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=563.44s)]
*  and everything else in the line of danger. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=566.12s)]
*  Well, Charles, it begins with the eradication of Hamas. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=570.2800000000001s)]
*  As long as Hamas is there, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=573.12s)]
*  it's absolutely impossible for anybody to rise up [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=574.76s)]
*  who will put the interests of his people and his children [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=578.2s)]
*  ahead of the grievances of the past, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=582.44s)]
*  ahead of the hatred for Israel. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=584.6400000000001s)]
*  So as long as Hamas is there, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=586.6400000000001s)]
*  it's virtually impossible. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=588.9599999999999s)]
*  But the key point here, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=590.12s)]
*  as you talked about the difference between Biden and Trump, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=591.52s)]
*  the key word is daylight. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=594.52s)]
*  There was massive daylight between Biden and Israel [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=595.92s)]
*  over the last 15 months. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=598.56s)]
*  And every time Hamas saw that daylight and empowered them [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=600.28s)]
*  and made them think that they can hang in there, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=603.24s)]
*  that they could potentially emerge victorious [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=605.1999999999999s)]
*  and in control, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=607.36s)]
*  the loss of life was meaningless to them. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=609.0s)]
*  That's part of their battle strategy, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=610.84s)]
*  so they didn't care about that. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=612.4s)]
*  Trump comes in and the daylight's completely shut, right? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=614.8s)]
*  It's shut by his words, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=617.92s)]
*  it's shut by the words of his team. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=619.2s)]
*  And that's the first step. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=621.64s)]
*  The coalition between Israel, the rock solid, hand in hand, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=624.32s)]
*  no daylight relationship between Israel and America [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=628.08s)]
*  is what gets this started, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=631.68s)]
*  at least the eradication of Hamas. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=632.84s)]
*  But there's no quick fix, Charles, I wish there was. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=635.04s)]
*  You gotta get rid of these terrorists [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=638.72s)]
*  before the decent people can emerge. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=640.12s)]
*  Former US ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=642.64s)]
*  thank you very much for your time and expertise [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=645.88s)]
*  and always, we love Israel, we pray for the best. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgSZ96sZLI&t=648.36s)]
