# Biden: 'Hope springs eternal' for hostage deal
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [September 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKPLfA5ED4)
*  The president actually did take questions. He just landed at the White House ahead of a meeting in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKPLfA5ED4&t=0.0s)]
*  the Situation Room between him and the Vice President Kamala Harris. They'll be discussing [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKPLfA5ED4&t=4.72s)]
*  the hostage negotiation team in the Situation Room following the tragic deaths of those six [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKPLfA5ED4&t=10.08s)]
*  hostages that were found murdered over the weekend. Let's listen to President Biden. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKPLfA5ED4&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  I'm heading to the national security meeting right now and then going to Pittsburgh. And so [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKPLfA5ED4&t=20.56s)]
*  checking on what's following up on what's happening in Israel and then I'll be off to [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKPLfA5ED4&t=31.68s)]
*  Pittsburgh. Are you planning to present a final hostage deal for both sides this week? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKPLfA5ED4&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  We're very close to that. What makes you think that this deal will be [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKPLfA5ED4&t=42.16s)]
*  successful in a way that the other deals were not? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKPLfA5ED4&t=45.92s)]
*  Hope turns eternal. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKPLfA5ED4&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  Mr. President, do you think it's time for Prime Minister Netanyahu to do more on this issue? Do [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKPLfA5ED4&t=51.440000000000005s)]
*  you think he's doing enough? No. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKPLfA5ED4&t=57.44s)]
*  Mr. President, what is your reaction to the demonstrations across Israel? What is your [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKPLfA5ED4&t=59.28s)]
*  reaction to the demonstrations? I'm going to get to detail when I walk into now. I'll talk to you [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKPLfA5ED4&t=63.92s)]
*  after that. Thank you. Thank you. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKPLfA5ED4&t=67.92s)]
*  Give a message for the hostages family, sir. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKPLfA5ED4&t=69.52s)]
*  Yes, I've spoken to the American hostage. I spoke to his mom and dad [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKPLfA5ED4&t=75.67999999999999s)]
*  and we're not giving up. We're going to continue to push as hard as we can. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKPLfA5ED4&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  Hope springs eternal. Those were his words as far as his optimism about a potential deal. But you [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKPLfA5ED4&t=92.16s)]
*  heard that reporter say what is different now and has been different in the past. It's hard to take [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKPLfA5ED4&t=99.04s)]
*  those words seriously when this has been ongoing for so long. It's difficult to imagine a scenario [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKPLfA5ED4&t=103.68s)]
*  where one could even make the idea possible that hope springs eternal when everything you've seen [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKPLfA5ED4&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  obviously speaks to the opposite. But I think he's trying to, at least it would appear, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKPLfA5ED4&t=115.36000000000001s)]
*  try to, I don't know, will this into existence. We'll have to see if it all works out. But [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKPLfA5ED4&t=119.44000000000001s)]
*  obviously as he continues his conversation with the negotiation team, Julie mentioned it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKPLfA5ED4&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  This will also include the vice president and this is somewhat common. They'll go in on the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKPLfA5ED4&t=128.8s)]
*  sitch. They'll talk for a while. We'll get some sort of a readout depending on what's happening. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKPLfA5ED4&t=133.44s)]
*  But I think what's really interesting is what perhaps he has to say afterwards. And maybe we'll [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKPLfA5ED4&t=138.32s)]
*  learn a little bit more about it at that event coming up in Pittsburgh this afternoon. I think [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKPLfA5ED4&t=143.76s)]
*  he's around 4 45 5 o'clock. Yes, this afternoon, sometime after 2, 2 45, they're going to be taking [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKPLfA5ED4&t=147.52s)]
*  off and they're going to be doing some campaigning. It'll be his first time campaigning with vice [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKPLfA5ED4&t=152.88s)]
*  president Kamala Harris. He was nice enough to come off of his beach vacation to join her. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKPLfA5ED4&t=156.64s)]
*  Brent and Joe. You love that. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilmeade. And I'm Ainsley Earhart. And [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKPLfA5ED4&t=161.35999999999999s)]
