# Former ambassador takes aim at Biden admin for 'dual message' on 'existential war'
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY)
*  With us right now is the former Israeli ambassador to the United States, Michael Oren. Ambassador, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=0.0s)]
*  very good to have you back. It sounds like a pressure campaign, Ambassador. I don't want to [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=4.64s)]
*  overanalyze it here. You're the expert at that. But it sounds like the administration is trying to say, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=10.32s)]
*  cool it. What do you think? I think, good to be with you as always. I think the administration [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  is speaking in two voices. It's sort of a good cop and bad cop scenario. We have, you had John [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=23.04s)]
*  Kirby before from the National Security Council, Matt Miller from the State Department, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=28.0s)]
*  being unequivocal in their support for Israel and expressing understanding of the great tactical [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=33.36s)]
*  military difficulties we have fighting a terrorist group which is embedded behind a civilian [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=38.64s)]
*  population, using that civilian population as human shields and also is underground and [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=43.6s)]
*  over 300 miles of tunnels and how difficult that is. And then you have other voices like [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=49.36s)]
*  the vice president's voice and at one point even the president himself saying that Israel was [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=54.4s)]
*  indiscriminately bombing. Occasionally, Secretary of State Blinken has talked about too many [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=58.48s)]
*  Palestinians being killed, too many civilians being killed. So it's sort of a, it's a dual message. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=63.12s)]
*  At the end of the day, what can I say? Israel has to continue the war, irrespective of what's [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=68.16s)]
*  coming out of Washington. It is an existential war for us. We can't lose. If we don't defeat Hamas, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=73.84s)]
*  we have no internal security. Large parts of the country become uninhabitable. We have 250,000 [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=81.84s)]
*  internal refugees, people who can't go back to their houses. They haven't lived, they're living [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=88.72s)]
*  in hotels for two and a half months. They won't go back to their houses along the borders unless [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  we defeat Hamas, unless we defeat the terrorists. So for us, it's a war of no choice and it would [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=96.48s)]
*  be much better to have total support from Washington, from the good cops and the good cops, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=102.72s)]
*  not bad cops. But at the end of the day, we're just going to have to keep on going. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  I'm wondering if the president himself is one of those bad cops, because not only as he rebuked [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=113.28s)]
*  you, Israel, or these multiple attacks on the Lebanese military and the Gaza war widening, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=118.80000000000001s)]
*  he's gone on to talk about a two-state solution. We mustn't lose hope for that. He's also said we [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  must be more sympathetic toward the Palestinians. He says that this is an issue that Israel just [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=133.04s)]
*  has to be more careful about civilian casualties in Gaza. In other words, he's more or less saying [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=141.12s)]
*  you've got to change things. And I wonder in these secret meetings behind closed doors, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=146.88s)]
*  and are you worried that aid to Israel is something that could be put on the table? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=154.88s)]
*  We're going to cut that back if you don't cut this out. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=159.84s)]
*  Well, so far that hasn't been the case. In fact, the president just expedited the shipment of [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=163.76s)]
*  very vital tank ammunition to Israel at bypassing Congress. And he hasn't revisited the case of 2014, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=169.2s)]
*  another war we had with Hamas when President Obama didn't supply vital helicopter ammunition [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=176.08s)]
*  to us during that, with the claim that we were causing too many casualties on the civilian [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  Palestinian side. But if I have a second to talk about that, Hamas gives out figures of casualties. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=186.8s)]
*  We know that they're greatly exaggerated. They do it every time. And they include the number of [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=194.56s)]
*  terrorists we've killed in that number. We've killed about 7,000 or 8,000 terrorists. They also [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=198.56s)]
*  include in that number the number of Palestinians who have been killed by rockets fired by Hamas. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=203.76s)]
*  About 30 percent of their rockets fall short onto Palestinian neighborhoods. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=209.28s)]
*  And so if you look at the actual casualty numbers, the ratio of civilian to combatant deaths in Gaza [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=213.28s)]
*  is about two to one. That's about half the ratio of the United States battles in Afghanistan and [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=220.24s)]
*  Iraq or even NATO's battle against Bosnia in Serbia in the late 1990s. By international modern [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=226.88000000000002s)]
*  standards, we're taking extraordinary precautions. And if Israel were, Neil, if we were indiscriminately [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=234.48000000000002s)]
*  bombing, we wouldn't be losing 10 soldiers like we lost the other day. And Israelis are scratching [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=240.88s)]
*  their heads and saying, hey, we're taking these impossible losses, these excruciating losses, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=246.32s)]
*  and there are people accusing us of bombing indiscriminately. And not only is it inaccurate, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=251.6s)]
*  it is flagrantly unfair and painful to us. All right, Ambassador, we'll see what happens. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsFf2PAUTmY&t=256.32s)]
