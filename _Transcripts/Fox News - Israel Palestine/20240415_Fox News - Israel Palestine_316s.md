# Fetterman breaks with Biden on Israel: 'ASTONISHING'
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU)
*  A few days after I became speaker, way back in October, we passed our Israel support package. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=0.0s)]
*  It's been sitting on Chuck Schumer's desk ever since. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=7.24s)]
*  The House Republicans and the Republican Party understand the necessity of standing with [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=9.36s)]
*  Israel. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=12.48s)]
*  We are going to try again this week. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=13.48s)]
*  And the details of that package are being put together right now. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=15.68s)]
*  We're looking at the options and all these supplemental issues. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=18.46s)]
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson putting aid to Israel on the front burner of the congressional [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=21.28s)]
*  agenda. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=24.8s)]
*  Following Iran's attack on our closest ally in the Middle East, want to bring in former [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=25.8s)]
*  House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=29.119999999999997s)]
*  Thanks for being here, sir. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  Morning. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=31.799999999999997s)]
*  So this week, the House was supposed to have all week long, they're going to talk about [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=32.8s)]
*  appliances. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=36.28s)]
*  And believe me, with the dishwasher that takes three hours, I'm here for that. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  But they're going to set that aside and they're going to focus on foreign policy. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  There's 17 bills that they're putting forward. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=45.32s)]
*  Aid to Israel and aid to Ukraine, possibly, are both on the table. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=47.34s)]
*  Can Speaker Johnson, with his very narrow majority, get it done? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=51.2s)]
*  Yes, I think there'll be overwhelming support. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=54.84s)]
*  The difficulty here is, why are we here? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=57.44s)]
*  The first thing we need to do is thank our men and women in uniform. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=59.72s)]
*  They did a tremendous job this weekend helping deflate what went on. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=62.96s)]
*  But remember what transpired. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=67.52s)]
*  For the first time in history, Iran sent missiles from their homeland directly into Israel. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=68.92s)]
*  This is something that has never happened before. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=75.56s)]
*  And why did it take place? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=77.64s)]
*  It is the foreign policy of the Biden administration. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=79.4s)]
*  What he did in Afghanistan, the allowing of raising the sanctions of the oil to produce [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=82.72s)]
*  not 400,000 barrels a day, but three million. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=89.48s)]
*  Iran has billions of dollars now and they're funding terrorism everywhere around. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=93.12s)]
*  Congress has been slow to act. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=97.92s)]
*  They should have taken care of this back in October because the world looks much different. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=99.12s)]
*  It looks a lot like the 1930s. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=103.4s)]
*  You have not just Iran, but Russia, North Korea and China creating the axis of evil [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=105.48s)]
*  bounding together. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=111.78s)]
*  We only saw this in the 30s. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=112.94s)]
*  So the actions that the House and Senate take really sends a message throughout the world. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=114.61999999999999s)]
*  It has been delayed since October 7th. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=120.17999999999999s)]
*  We're talking six months before we have taken action on Israel. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=122.17999999999999s)]
*  I think it was a mistake to try to put a paper on this. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=125.46s)]
*  It sends the wrong message around the world. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=127.94s)]
*  Much of this funding will go to reproduce weaponry for our own stockpiles because we [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=130.54s)]
*  have been sending just as we used missiles this weekend to deflect what Iran was sending. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=136.74s)]
*  It's our own stockpiles here in America. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=142.06s)]
*  We should not be depleted. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=144.42000000000002s)]
*  We should not be in a weaker situation. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=145.68s)]
*  But if you simply look back to what then Vice President Biden wrote in 2020 about the policy [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=148.3s)]
*  for the Middle East, it shows every decision he made has been wrong. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=155.66s)]
*  Secretary Gates has been right. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=159.46s)]
*  This change in foreign policy here has led to five embassies evacuating from America [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=161.3s)]
*  on foreign soil. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=166.78s)]
*  What happened in Afghanistan, the movement to our allies looking towards China, and now [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=168.10000000000002s)]
*  for the first time in history, Iran sending missiles into Israel. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=172.4s)]
*  But just to add to that, the Middle East has changed, period. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=176.14000000000001s)]
*  In our lifetimes, there are alliances now that never existed before. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=180.42000000000002s)]
*  And if you just listen to the end of Jennifer's report there, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=185.22000000000003s)]
*  coming to Israel's defense, this is a remarkable moment, really one to behold. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=190.3s)]
*  But let's look at why. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=195.3s)]
*  Dems are divided on the whole idea. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=197.82000000000002s)]
*  And John Fetterman, the Democratic Senator from Pennsylvania, he just pierced that point [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=201.46s)]
*  on CNN Sunday. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=206.10000000000002s)]
*  Watch him, what he said there. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=207.38000000000002s)]
*  I think it really demonstrates how it's astonishing that we are not standing firmly with Israel [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=209.5s)]
*  and there should never be any kinds of conditions on all that. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=215.74s)]
*  And then a nation can launch hundreds of drones towards Israel. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=219.26s)]
*  And I'm not going to be talking about conditions ever. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=223.66s)]
*  OK, your witness. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=226.85999999999999s)]
*  Go ahead, sir. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=228.26s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's an excellent position. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=229.26s)]
*  I think Fetterman has been superior when it comes to his position on how to deal with [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=230.98s)]
*  Israel. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=235.38s)]
*  But remember with President Biden being sworn in January 2020, why are all those nations [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=236.38s)]
*  working together? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=241.38s)]
*  The Abraham Accords. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=242.45999999999998s)]
*  This is something that we've never seen before. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=244.18s)]
*  That should have been a Nobel Prize recipient because of what happened there. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=246.01999999999998s)]
*  But had President Biden embraced the Abraham Accords on the day he was sworn in, Saudi [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=249.78s)]
*  Arabia would be a part of it today. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=254.98s)]
*  October 7th would never take place and this weekend would not have taken place. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=256.74s)]
*  And the hostages would still not be held today. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=261.58s)]
*  This is uniqueness in the policy change from the last administration. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=265.02s)]
*  But you actually have Democrats as Fetterman. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=269.38s)]
*  But that's not where the majority of Democrats have been. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=272.06s)]
*  They have shifted their position on Israel. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=274.76s)]
*  They have shifted politically and you've watched the president shift as well from October [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=277.15999999999997s)]
*  7th today, leaning more towards where this Democrat Party is going. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=281.56s)]
*  Appeasement to a terrorist organization. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=286.68s)]
*  It's not acceptable and it's causing more harm and we are less safe today because of [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=289.03999999999996s)]
*  it. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=294.15999999999997s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=295.44s)]
*  It was interesting to see how many Democrats put out a lot of statements in support of [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=296.44s)]
*  Israel as those missiles rained down on Saturday night. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=299.56s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy, thanks for being here. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=302.68s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2LylG7lEkU&t=304.24s)]
