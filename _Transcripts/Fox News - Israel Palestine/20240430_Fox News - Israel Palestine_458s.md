# 'ABSOLUTE ANARCHY': Anti-Israel protesters at Columbia take over campus building
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4)
*  Let us bring in Alison Esposito, who's running for Congress in New York and is a retired [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=0.0s)]
*  New York police officer. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=4.4s)]
*  Your reaction to these scenes of absolute overnight anarchy and the university administrators [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=6.12s)]
*  who have allowed this to get this far to happen. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=11.94s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=20.28s)]
*  Well, thank you so much for having me. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=21.28s)]
*  That's exactly what this is. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=22.96s)]
*  This is anarchy. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=24.12s)]
*  This is absolute unrest and it's absolutely unacceptable. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=25.28s)]
*  You have a group of overly emotional and underly informed individuals that are picking and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=29.24s)]
*  choosing what laws they will abide by in the name of social protest. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  And it's absolutely ludicrous. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=41.32s)]
*  You have a group of students that have now taken over a building and there have been [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=43.48s)]
*  reports overnight of faculty members that were inside the building that were briefly [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=47.28s)]
*  even held hostage. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=52.12s)]
*  This is going to continue to escalate and get worse and worse and worse until, God forbid, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=53.78s)]
*  someone gets hurt. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=58.8s)]
*  It is the time now for strong, decisive leadership. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=59.96s)]
*  You see schools around the country where some leaders are stepping forward and stopping [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=63.559999999999995s)]
*  this anarchy from happening. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=68.8s)]
*  In the name of social protest, these students have believed that they are not accountable [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=70.64s)]
*  for their actions. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=75.44s)]
*  And that is actually pinpointed by the spiraling decline now in society where criminals are [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=76.66s)]
*  not held accountable for their actions. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  We need to take a hard stand and end this now before it gets worse. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  And to that point that you just made, as a police officer, give us a lesson on law and [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=90.08s)]
*  order, of controlling mobs, of negotiating with individuals like this. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=94.92s)]
*  How would you have put a swift end to this before scenes like this could even think about [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  happening? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=105.72s)]
*  So this is beyond negotiations at this point. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=110.48s)]
*  As a New York City police officer, I retired as an inspector of the 70th Police Precinct. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=114.28s)]
*  We dealt with a lot of protests throughout my 25-year tenure. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=119.64s)]
*  Social protest, abiding by the laws, is one thing. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=124.83999999999999s)]
*  But once it crosses the line into criminal behavior, once you are stopping emergency [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=128.4s)]
*  vehicles from getting to where they need to be, once you are taking over schools, once [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=133.6s)]
*  you are not allowing students, based on their Jewish faith, to cross into buildings and [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=138.48s)]
*  cross over lines, you have gone into the criminal element of this and it has to be dealt with. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=145.24s)]
*  They have to be held accountable for their actions. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=151.07999999999998s)]
*  The students are demanding amnesty for all the laws that they're breaking. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=153.28s)]
*  That is absolutely unacceptable. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=157.12s)]
*  This needs to be shut down. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=158.4s)]
*  The leaders must be taken into custody and charged appropriately. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=159.64s)]
*  Those who have been wielding hammers and breaking windows, destroying properties, holding people [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=164.0s)]
*  hostage, I saw the reports of a Jewish student or a Jewish individual being tased yesterday [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=169.55999999999997s)]
*  on one of the campuses. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=175.6s)]
*  It's time for quick, decisive, strong leadership. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=177.23999999999998s)]
*  The students must be held accountable for their actions. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=181.32s)]
*  If there are professional agitators there, they must be held accountable for their actions. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=183.57999999999998s)]
*  All crimes must be prosecuted. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=187.92s)]
*  The NYPD or the National Guard, the NYPD is some of the best in the business. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=190.06s)]
*  They are going to go in, they will make the arrests that they need to with the professionalism [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=194.46s)]
*  that we demand. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=198.9s)]
*  There will not be incidents escalated by the police department, but the students need to [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=200.3s)]
*  understand that if you do the crime, you're going to be held accountable. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=204.94s)]
*  And leadership, both in the government and leadership in these colleges, needs to step [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=209.02s)]
*  forward and hold these students accountable. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=213.18s)]
*  You said National Guard. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=215.68s)]
*  Do we need to see the National Guard today, basically when the sun comes up, if you can [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=216.98s)]
*  mobilize them that quickly? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=222.34s)]
*  We don't need the National Guard in New York City. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=228.18s)]
*  The NYPD is ready and capable of handling protests such as this, handling mob crimes [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=230.62s)]
*  such as this. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=239.02s)]
*  They are absolutely capable of going in there and ending this today. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=240.82s)]
*  They did it with Occupy Wall Street. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=244.72s)]
*  We did it with the protests, the Mostly Peaceful protests, aka riots of 2020. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=247.28s)]
*  The NYPD is more than capable of handling this. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=252.76000000000002s)]
*  They need to be allowed to do their job. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=255.44s)]
*  I asked you what you would do if you were in charge as a police officer, as someone [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=257.24s)]
*  in law enforcement. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=261.32s)]
*  You're running for Congress. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=262.8s)]
*  Now I'm going to ask you what you would do if you get to the hallowed halls of Congress. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=263.8s)]
*  What will you do to put a stop to this? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=267.6s)]
*  Well, listen, I'm a law and order candidate. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=275.56s)]
*  And the government's number one job is to keep their people safe. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=279.24s)]
*  And they're failing to do that. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=282.84000000000003s)]
*  I'm running for United States Congress because we are seeing a decline of law and order in [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=285.0s)]
*  this country. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=292.88s)]
*  And it's not rocket science. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=294.12s)]
*  It's 101. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=295.48s)]
*  We need to be holding criminals accountable for their actions. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=296.48s)]
*  You know, it's like cutting the head off a snake. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=299.56s)]
*  The rest of the snake will wither. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=302.2s)]
*  If you take the leaders of this protest into custody, normalcy will resume. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=303.92s)]
*  It has to be decisive leadership, strong leadership that's coming out of Albany, that's coming [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=309.68s)]
*  out of Washington, and that's coming out of the hallowed halls of the academia. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=314.44s)]
*  You mentioned the word consequences. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=320.44s)]
*  There need to be consequences for our actions in life, no matter whether it's this scene, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=321.76s)]
*  whether you're dealing with a child who's one year old. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=327.04s)]
*  You try to teach them right from wrong. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=329.6s)]
*  But these protesters, this to me is the wildest part of the story. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=331.48s)]
*  They are not only demanding all that they are demanding with regard to Israeli divestment, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=335.12s)]
*  but they're also demanding amnesty for anything that they do, whether it's breaking the glass [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=339.36s)]
*  like you see on the screen, whether it's preventing people from taking finals, whether it's intimidating [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=344.48s)]
*  their fellow students, many of whom are Jewish. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=349.88s)]
*  What's your message to, quite frankly, Allison, these children who want no consequences for [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=353.6s)]
*  their actions? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=359.6s)]
*  Well, the adults need to take over. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=362.48s)]
*  The adults in the room need to take over in this situation. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=366.40000000000003s)]
*  Imagine these are the same students that are not going to be allowed to graduate, that [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=370.6s)]
*  went through the pandemic a few years back and didn't have their senior proms or high [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=375.08000000000004s)]
*  school graduations. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=379.20000000000005s)]
*  The adults in the room need to take over. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=380.68s)]
*  You don't have amnesty. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=382.62s)]
*  You don't get to demand amnesty to crimes in the name of social protest. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=384.82s)]
*  That's not how this works. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=390.08000000000004s)]
*  The adults need to take over. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=391.52000000000004s)]
*  These students need to understand, maybe for the first time in their lives, that there [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=392.96000000000004s)]
*  are consequences to your actions and you don't get to commit crime just because you're feigning [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=397.12s)]
*  outrage, just because you're upset with something, just because you don't agree with something. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=402.82000000000005s)]
*  This is not the way life and society works. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=408.24s)]
*  This society needs to come down and make sure they know that there are consequences for [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=411.16s)]
*  their actions. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=416.72s)]
*  It's a call on the adults in the room who know better, who should know better, that [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=417.72s)]
*  should be telling these students that you are not going to get amnesty. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=422.48s)]
*  You will be suspended. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=426.52000000000004s)]
*  You will be expelled and we will uphold the rights of our Jewish students and the students [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=427.8s)]
*  at the universities right to study peacefully and right to enter buildings and access places [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=432.24s)]
*  on campus based on the $70,000 a year tuition that their parents are paying. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=438.40000000000003s)]
*  Allison Esposito, gotta leave it there. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=444.08000000000004s)]
*  Amazing insight. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl0GB3MFMV4&t=446.04s)]
