# Tim Walz under fire for not answering question on murdered hostages
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [September 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM)
*  So let's go to the region now. Middle East Israeli forces killing a top Hamas commander. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=0.0s)]
*  The IDF reporting recent airstrikes over Gaza taking out a mastermind behind the October 7th attacks [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=5.0s)]
*  alongside seven other terrorists. And Trey Yngst is on that story. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=12.0s)]
*  An update now from Tel Aviv. And Trey, hello to you. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=15.0s)]
*  Yeah, hey Bill, good morning. Look, the psychological warfare of Hamas continues. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=20.0s)]
*  And overnight the group released a statement from its top military spokesman Abul Abaeda [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=24.0s)]
*  saying that Hamas was given new instructions about what to do if Israeli forces approach. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=30.0s)]
*  They instructed their militants in the field that more hostages would be killed if the IDF tries to rescue them. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=36.0s)]
*  That statement came after a funeral was held for American citizen Hirsch Goldberg-Polen in Jerusalem. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=43.0s)]
*  Thousands of people lined the streets to pay their respects as his parents eulogized their son. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=49.0s)]
*  Okay, sweet boy, go now on your journey. I hope it's as good as the trips you dreamed about. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=54.0s)]
*  Because finally, my sweet boy, finally, finally, finally, finally, you're free. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=61.0s)]
*  For 330 days, mama and I sought the proverbial stone that we could turn over to save you. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=66.0s)]
*  Maybe, just maybe, your death is the stone, the fuel that will bring home the remaining 101 hostages. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=74.0s)]
*  Once again, Hamas tried to pressure Israel during this time by releasing a new video showing the hostages alive. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=84.0s)]
*  After the execution of these six Israeli hostages, there are new questions about how the war will end. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=92.0s)]
*  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke last night at a press conference. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=97.0s)]
*  He made clear he's not willing to compromise on the issue of the Philadelphia Corridor, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=101.0s)]
*  a strip of land between Gaza and Egypt where Israeli troops are currently deployed. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=106.0s)]
*  There were also protests last night outside of the Prime Minister's home in Jerusalem [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=111.0s)]
*  as people here demand a deal to bring the remaining hostages home. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=115.0s)]
*  Now overnight, I received a long statement from a senior Hamas official actually blaming Israel and the United States for the execution of these hostages. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=119.0s)]
*  Of course, there was no evidence provided, but it gives you a little bit about the mindset of this organization. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=128.0s)]
*  They are blaming Israel and America rather than sitting at the negotiating table. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=133.0s)]
*  Bill? Or blaming Hamas. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=139.0s)]
*  Trey Yanks, thank you, in Tel Aviv. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=141.0s)]
*  Let's bring in Dan Sinor, former Foreign Policy Advisor in the Bush administration. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=143.0s)]
*  He's the host of the must listen to, Call Me Back podcast. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=147.0s)]
*  And Dan, I know, first let me give you a chance to talk about the hostages and the families, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=151.0s)]
*  because I know that you had been very closely working with them, had been getting close to them, knew them personally. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=155.0s)]
*  And your thoughts this morning? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=161.0s)]
*  It's soul-crushing. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=163.0s)]
*  Six Israelis slaughtered, including one American, American Israeli. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=165.0s)]
*  Two of the families I knew quite well, Carmel, Gott's family, and Hirsch, Goldberg-Poland's family. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=172.0s)]
*  I will say it's depressing for so many reasons, not the least of which, there was a sense among all these families that there was good news coming sometime soon. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=180.0s)]
*  Combination of the increased tempo in the rescue operations by the IDF. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=191.0s)]
*  They are really learning how to operate inside those tunnels, and they have been increasingly rescuing hostages. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=196.0s)]
*  And then talk of a hostage deal. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=202.0s)]
*  So one of those two things, one of those two paths seemed viable, and then suddenly this. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=203.0s)]
*  And I just, it's, every death is heartbreaking, but when you know the families, it's especially so. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=209.0s)]
*  So here's the issue. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=216.0s)]
*  For many who are protesting Netanyahu and Israel, Hamas started the war. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=218.0s)]
*  Hamas took them captive. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=223.0s)]
*  Hamas kidnapped them for up to 11 months. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=225.0s)]
*  Hamas executed them in the back of the head, including bullets through the heart. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=228.0s)]
*  And somehow it's Israel's problem. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=232.0s)]
*  And here's Netanyahu addressing a lot of these negotiations. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=234.0s)]
*  Israel agreed to the lines that Biden offered and Hamas refused it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=238.0s)]
*  Blinken said Israel agreed to the American suggestion offer. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=246.0s)]
*  Now Hamas has to do so. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=254.0s)]
*  This five days ago, what happened these five days? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=256.0s)]
*  One thing happened. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=261.0s)]
*  They murdered six of our, in cold blood, six of our hostages. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=264.0s)]
*  What's the expectation for the White House? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=269.0s)]
*  I mean, it seemed like the line just continues to move. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=272.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=275.0s)]
*  And now they're trying to placate Democrats in the far left. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=276.0s)]
*  So as the Prime Minister said, since April 27th, there have been five times where the U.S. government, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=279.0s)]
*  where the administration has said whether it's in the president's own voice, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=286.0s)]
*  whether it's in the voice of Anthony Blinken, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=288.0s)]
*  whether it's in the voice of the deputy director of the CIA, David Cohn, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=290.0s)]
*  Israel has agreed to the proposal. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=294.0s)]
*  We are now waiting on Hamas, and then Hamas rejects the proposal. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=296.0s)]
*  So each time Israel agrees and Hamas rejects, Israel's put in this position, do more, do more, do more. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=299.0s)]
*  Especially after six Israelis are slaughtered. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=306.0s)]
*  Do more, do more, do more. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=309.0s)]
*  What is Israel supposed to do without compromising the possibility there's another October 7th? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=311.0s)]
*  And I think whether one supports Prime Minister Netanyahu inside Israel [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=317.0s)]
*  or one abhors Prime Minister Netanyahu inside Israel, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=320.0s)]
*  on the core issue of what the Prime Minister is arguing, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=323.0s)]
*  Israel has to prevent another October 7th from happening. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=326.0s)]
*  And some of the security conditions it is demanding in the context of these negotiations [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=329.0s)]
*  are essential to preventing another October 7th. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=333.0s)]
*  And Israel can't be pressured to let go of those conditions [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=336.0s)]
*  after it's been making concession after concession after concession. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=340.0s)]
*  I want to play for you this short clip from vice presidential nominee Tim Walz. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=344.0s)]
*  Asked about his reaction, this is what happened. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=349.0s)]
*  What's your reaction to the six hostages being found dead in Java? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=352.0s)]
*  Thanks everybody. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=357.0s)]
*  I did press for a politician, so did you. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=359.0s)]
*  To me, unacceptable. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=363.0s)]
*  Shocking. I actually was shocked by it. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=365.0s)]
*  Look, he's new to the national scene, I guess, although he's a pretty seasoned... [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=368.0s)]
*  He's a congressman. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=372.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, and a governor, and a two-term governor. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=373.0s)]
*  He's a pretty seasoned politician. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=375.0s)]
*  And also apparently somebody who would be ready on day one to be commander in chief. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=376.0s)]
*  Right, and it is true, it sounds from what I've read, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=380.0s)]
*  that one of his press handlers said, come on, we've got to go, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=383.0s)]
*  you're not going to answer that question. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=385.0s)]
*  The question is, what was his visceral reaction to the news [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=387.0s)]
*  that these six Israelis were slaughtered, including an American citizen? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=390.0s)]
*  An American citizen was executed in the dungeon of Gaza in one of these tunnels. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=394.0s)]
*  What is your gut reaction? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=400.0s)]
*  Why don't you, as you and I were just talking about before we came on, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=401.0s)]
*  why doesn't the governor Walz say, hold on to his handler, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=404.0s)]
*  I'm going to answer this question because I have a visceral reaction, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=408.0s)]
*  an emotional reaction to an American being slaughtered by this terrorist organization. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=411.0s)]
*  And he just, it was unnerving. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=416.0s)]
*  Fumbling, entirely. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=419.0s)]
*  I mean, never even have possession of the ball. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=420.0s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=422.0s)]
*  Just leave it for another day. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=423.0s)]
*  I'll talk about ice cream, but I won't answer that question. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=425.0s)]
*  It's abhorrent. It should not have happened. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=427.0s)]
*  And they better take a better stance soon, Dan. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=429.0s)]
*  Yeah, and I'll just say, throughout these last few months, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=431.0s)]
*  before she was the nominee, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=435.0s)]
*  Vice President Harris made a series of statements, very critical of Israel, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=436.0s)]
*  on how it's operated since October 7th, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=440.0s)]
*  including saying that Israel cannot go into Rafa. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=442.0s)]
*  She was adamant months ago that Israel cannot go into Rafa. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=445.0s)]
*  Remember, she saw the maps. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=448.0s)]
*  Israel can't go into Rafa. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=450.0s)]
*  What we learned in these past few days is there are a lot of American [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=451.0s)]
*  and Israeli hostages in Rafa, underground. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=454.0s)]
*  The leadership of Hamas is in Rafa. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=457.0s)]
*  The idea that Harris is saying, dictating, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=460.0s)]
*  or had been dictating that Israel can't go into Rafa is very disconcerting. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=463.0s)]
*  And then when her vice presidential nominee doesn't even want to talk about it. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=467.0s)]
*  Has the Biden administration taken a position on who controls the Philadelphia corridor? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=471.0s)]
*  They have basically said that Israel had agreed to their proposal, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=476.0s)]
*  their bridging proposal, which kept Israel to some degree in the Philadelphia corridor. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=481.0s)]
*  But the Biden administration would like Israel to agree to get out of the Philadelphia corridor, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=485.0s)]
*  because in their view, it would lubricate the negotiations. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=490.0s)]
*  By the way, I don't think they will, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=494.0s)]
*  because I don't think Hamas is ultimately serious about a deal. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=495.0s)]
*  They just keep pushing and pushing and pushing for Israel to make concessions. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=497.0s)]
*  Dancing in our thank you and our condolences, if you could pass them on to the families. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=500.0s)]
*  Thank you, Dan. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxiJuLcpyM&t=505.0s)]
