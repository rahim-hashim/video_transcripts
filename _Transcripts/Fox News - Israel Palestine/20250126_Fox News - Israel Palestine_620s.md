# GOP Senator hopes this is not seen during Trump nominee hearing
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [January 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg)
*  Joining us now, Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=0.0s)]
*  He's got a brand new book out, by the way, next month entitled Seven Things You Can't [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=2.04s)]
*  Say About China. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=6.08s)]
*  And Senator, we'll see if we get to any of those seven in this conversation. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=7.32s)]
*  We're definitely going to talk about China. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=10.84s)]
*  But I want to ask you about the reporting there that Lucas had about the firing of these [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=11.96s)]
*  inspectors general. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=14.92s)]
*  I've talked to, I've heard of some from some of your GOP colleagues who are concerned about [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=15.92s)]
*  this saying it didn't give the proper notification, even if ultimately it would be. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=19.84s)]
*  The notice wasn't there. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=23.86s)]
*  And is President Trump signaling he's just going to, you know, observe which loss he [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=25.78s)]
*  wants to and not others? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=29.62s)]
*  Well, Shannon, time and time again, the Supreme Court has said that Congress can't impose [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=30.62s)]
*  restrictions on the president's power to remove officers. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=35.7s)]
*  In President Trump's first term, he removed the director of the Consumer Finance Protection [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=39.14s)]
*  Bureau. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=43.02s)]
*  Despite limitations on the president's constitutional power to remove officers, that was litigated [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=44.02s)]
*  up the Supreme Court and the president won. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=47.74s)]
*  So ultimately, these inspectors general serve at the pleasure of the president. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=49.86s)]
*  He wants new people in there. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=54.7s)]
*  He wants people who focused on getting out waste and fraud and abuse and reforming these [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=56.22s)]
*  agencies. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=60.98s)]
*  He has a right to get in there who he wants. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=61.98s)]
*  Do you think he will? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=64.38s)]
*  That's the next question because there have been times when those inspector general slots [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=65.38s)]
*  have been left open by various presidents. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=68.58s)]
*  Are you confident, because they're your eyes and ears as lawmakers, that they will be filled? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=70.42s)]
*  I believe so. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=74.25999999999999s)]
*  And he says he wants to fill those offices. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=75.25999999999999s)]
*  Maybe he won't fill them immediately because there's an entire administration to staff [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=76.7s)]
*  and he may have other priorities. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=80.1s)]
*  But I think the president's inherent power to remove officers will be upheld if it's [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=81.94s)]
*  challenged in court, as it has been time and again for Democratic and Republican presidents [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=85.42s)]
*  alike. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=89.53999999999999s)]
*  I want to ask you about the Middle East. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=90.53999999999999s)]
*  Former hostages home, you've been critical of this deal. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=91.97999999999999s)]
*  You've had some concerns about it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=94.3s)]
*  It came together, seems like an approach from President Biden and President Trump. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=95.38s)]
*  Are you confident in the deal moving forward, the fact that there is progress? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=99.38s)]
*  We are getting these people home. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=102.38s)]
*  Of course we welcome home these hostages and you can't help but be overjoyed in your heart [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=104.89999999999999s)]
*  to see families welcoming them back. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=109.06s)]
*  At the same time, my general preference is not to negotiate with terrorists. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=111.94000000000001s)]
*  Hamas was on its back foot. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=115.54s)]
*  They're not destroyed. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=118.54s)]
*  They were almost destroyed. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=119.54s)]
*  After Hiroshima and Nagasaki, we didn't negotiate with Imperial Japan. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=120.9s)]
*  We said unconditional surrender and give us our 40,000 Americans back. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=124.02000000000001s)]
*  That said, the deal is underway. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=128.14000000000001s)]
*  We predicted at the time that Hamas might break the terms of the deal and that's apparently [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=130.58s)]
*  exactly what happened yesterday by not sending home Israeli civilian women. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=134.14000000000001s)]
*  Which is one reason why the Israeli government has paused the relocation of Gazans to certain [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=138.3s)]
*  areas inside of Gaza. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=143.06s)]
*  I would say if Hamas wants to continue this ceasefire, they need to respect every single [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=144.62s)]
*  term of that deal. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=149.62s)]
*  We're watching minute by minute as two other phases are still yet to be negotiated as well. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=150.62s)]
*  I want to ask you about these hearings this week. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=154.78s)]
*  Your Senate Intel Committee that you now chair will hear from Tulsi Gabbard, the DNI nominee. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=156.46s)]
*  She's got plenty of critics out there. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=161.42000000000002s)]
*  From both sides of the aisle, let me read from a former chairman of the U.S. National [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=162.9s)]
*  Intelligence Council writing that she's got no background in intelligence whatsoever and [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=166.7s)]
*  has never managed much of anything. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=170.26s)]
*  Even more worryingly as someone meant to advise the president and protect our nation's secrets [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=172.74s)]
*  from our adversaries, Gabbard has cozied up to at least two vicious dictators who are [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=176.98s)]
*  America's enemies. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=182.66s)]
*  There are concerns about her positions with Bashar al-Assad, Edward Snowden, her use of [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=183.86s)]
*  FISA and those tools and how she feels about them. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=188.7s)]
*  Are you confident that you've had your questions on those issues addressed? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=191.7s)]
*  Yeah, I've had many occasions to speak with Ms. Gabbard, as have the members of the committee [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=195.02s)]
*  and other senators. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=198.70000000000002s)]
*  We got her background checked back along with her financial papers last week. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=200.46s)]
*  We promptly scheduled a hearing seven days later as the rules of our committee allow. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=204.42000000000002s)]
*  And I can promise you and all Americans that Tulsi Gabbard is going to have a full hearing [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=209.14000000000001s)]
*  on Thursday. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=213.94000000000003s)]
*  It's going to be just like the hearing that we conducted for John Ratcliffe and the hearings [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=214.94000000000003s)]
*  that the committee has conducted for nominees from both the Democratic and Republican presidents [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=218.5s)]
*  alike. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=222.98s)]
*  No more, no less, no better, no worse. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=223.98s)]
*  I understand that people have their differences of opinion with Ms. Gabbard. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=225.89999999999998s)]
*  Probably some Republicans disagree with the vote she's cast as a Democratic congresswoman. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=229.94s)]
*  A lot of Democrats may be upset that she finally saw the light and left the Democratic party. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=233.85999999999999s)]
*  I do hope though that we won't see anyone questioning her patriotism. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=238.54s)]
*  Hillary Clinton has basically called her a traitor in the past. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=243.14s)]
*  This is a woman who served more than 20 years in our nation's army. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=246.45999999999998s)]
*  She's passed five different background checks. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=251.1s)]
*  I reviewed the latest one. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=253.29999999999998s)]
*  It's clean as a whistle. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=254.68s)]
*  It's fine for people to have policy differences and ask questions about those differences. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=256.1s)]
*  I hope no one would impugn Ms. Gabbard's patriotism or her integrity. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=260.62s)]
*  There are reports in both Axios and National Review quoting GOP senators saying they think [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=265.1s)]
*  she might not even make it out of committee. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=269.38s)]
*  I mean, are there things about her conversations, her positions with regard to Assad or to Putin [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=271.1s)]
*  that raise any concern for you? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=276.54s)]
*  Well, I think there's a lot of people making predictions on background about the president's [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=278.26s)]
*  nominees that don't come true. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=281.94s)]
*  If you recall, Pete Hexeth in early December was on the verge of withdrawing and being [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=283.46s)]
*  replaced by someone and now he's Secretary Hexeth at the Department of Defense. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=287.5s)]
*  They've been making a lot of the similar predictions about Donald Trump over the last few years [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=291.02s)]
*  and he's now staged the greatest political comeback in American history. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=295.26s)]
*  So again, we'll have a full and fair hearing from Ms. Gabbard on Thursday. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=298.38s)]
*  She'll be able to explain her past statements and her votes. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=302.5s)]
*  She'll explain, I'm sure, also, that whatever her views on certain policies, programs or laws, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=306.7s)]
*  that she will faithfully execute the president's agenda. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=311.06s)]
*  And if she's confirmed, she'll give an unbiased and unvarnished look at the intelligence that [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=314.1s)]
*  comes in every day about the nation's threats. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=318.46s)]
*  One of those threats you've been long vocal about is China. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=320.66s)]
*  Let's talk about TikTok because President Trump seems to be willing to pause the ban [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=323.82s)]
*  on TikTok and to try to work out a deal. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=328.64s)]
*  There are different conversations and rumors about what may come together, but he's indicated [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=330.62s)]
*  he may be willing to allow some level of Chinese ownership or connection to this. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=334.34s)]
*  And he gives this explanation to our colleague, Sean Hannity, about why. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=340.02s)]
*  But you can say that about everything made in China. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=346.85999999999996s)]
*  Look, we have our telephones made in China, for the most part. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=348.82s)]
*  We have so many things made in China. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=352.02s)]
*  So why don't they mention that? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=354.17999999999995s)]
*  Your response? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=356.65999999999997s)]
*  Well, the law that we passed last year is in effect and the law is the law and it imposes [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=357.65999999999997s)]
*  ruinous consequences on any company that continues to host or distribute TikTok. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=361.82s)]
*  Not just at this point, not just liability, but bankruptcy because the penalties are so [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=366.46s)]
*  high that most medium sized countries couldn't pay them. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=370.34s)]
*  So I want to commend those companies like Apple and Google that are following the law [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=373.92s)]
*  and no longer hosting TikTok. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=377.5s)]
*  But our point in passing that law was never to ban TikTok in the United States. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=379.74s)]
*  It was to force ByteDance, its parent company that is controlled by the Chinese communists, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=383.82s)]
*  to divest from TikTok. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=389.53999999999996s)]
*  To have a TikTok that is not influenced by Chinese communists. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=391.42s)]
*  It's not just a threat to our privacy and data, although it certainly is that. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=395.46s)]
*  It's a threat because it spreads propaganda like anti-Semitic content and pro-Hamas content. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=399.58s)]
*  It exposes children to extreme violence, obscenity, drug use, even encouraging suicide. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=406.34s)]
*  And it can be used as an actual tool of statecraft. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=413.94s)]
*  As you saw when Congress passed the law, TikTok sent push notices to its users' phones urging [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=416.34s)]
*  them to contact Congress and lobby against the law. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=420.98s)]
*  What might they do if Donald Trump imposes tariffs on China or in a moment of heightened [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=424.06s)]
*  tension around Taiwan? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=428.46000000000004s)]
*  That's why it's critical that there be a complete and total break with Communist China. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=430.14000000000004s)]
*  And that's exactly what the law insists. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=434.34000000000003s)]
*  As for a deal, I'm not really concerned about whether this American company or that American [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=436.42s)]
*  group of investors buys it. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=441.58000000000004s)]
*  Or for that matter, if we work with partners in places like Europe or the Middle East or [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=442.96000000000004s)]
*  If it's controlled by an ally, that's very different than it's controlled by Communist China. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=448.26s)]
*  OK, I want to try to get to two quick things before you go. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=452.58s)]
*  While we're on the subject of China, this was a headline from the New York Times yesterday. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=455.82s)]
*  CIA now favors lab leak theory to explain COVID's origins. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=459.34s)]
*  This was their headline in February of 2020. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=463.9s)]
*  Senator Tom Cotton repeats fringe theory of coronavirus origins. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=466.3s)]
*  Do you feel some level of vindication? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=470.02s)]
*  Well, I said from the very beginning, COVID probably came from that lab. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=471.86s)]
*  I didn't have access to classified intelligence or special scientific knowledge. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=475.46000000000004s)]
*  I just used a little common sense and looked at the facts and understood what Chinese Communists do. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=478.7s)]
*  I'm glad that in the final days of the Biden administration, the CIA reached the same conclusion [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=483.66s)]
*  and I commend John Ratcliffe for making that conclusion public. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=487.98s)]
*  The important thing now is that we have to make China pay for unleashing this plague on the world, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=491.02000000000004s)]
*  just like we have to make them pay for stealing our jobs and harming American workers and [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=495.58000000000004s)]
*  businesses by doing things like imposing tariffs on them, on strategically critical goods, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=500.06s)]
*  or passing my legislation or repeal their most their permanent most favored nation status. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=505.98s)]
*  All right, very quickly before you go, President Trump has taken back the security detail for [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=510.38s)]
*  a number of people. Anthony Fauci, Mike Pompeo, Brian Hook, among them, John Bolton, too. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=515.02s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal editorial board says, pray it won't happen. But what if one of them [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=520.7s)]
*  now gets attacked? If Iran commits violence against any of these men, Mr. Trump won't be able to [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=524.86s)]
*  escape some responsibility. Yeah, I would encourage the president to revisit the decision [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=529.5s)]
*  for those people who are being targeted by Iran. As the president was targeted for assassination [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=533.98s)]
*  by Iran, as the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, I've reviewed the intelligence in [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=538.22s)]
*  the last few days. The threat to anyone involved in President Trump's strike on Qasem Soleimani [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=541.9s)]
*  is persistent. It's real. Iran is committed to vengeance against all of these people. In fact, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=548.06s)]
*  the chief of staff of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence agreed with me that if [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=554.14s)]
*  these threats were against him or his family, that he would want security because the threats [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=558.62s)]
*  are real. There are gaps in our coverage. We don't know what we don't know. And it's better to be [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=563.98s)]
*  safe than sorry because it's not just about these men who helped President Trump carry out his [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=568.62s)]
*  policy in his first term. It's about his fam, their family and friends, innocent bystanders [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=572.7s)]
*  every time they're in public. It's also about the president being able to get good people and get [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=577.74s)]
*  good advice. If people are saying going to work for the president now on Iran or China or North [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=581.9s)]
*  Korea or the Mexican drug cartels, they might hesitate to do so or they might hesitate if [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=587.26s)]
*  they're in office to give him the advice he needs or carry out the policies that he decides upon. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=592.06s)]
*  Senator, thank you for your time. We'll be watching Thursday for that hearing. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=598.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=600.9399999999999s)]
*  So subscribe right now. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiiDAQouMg&t=617.26s)]
