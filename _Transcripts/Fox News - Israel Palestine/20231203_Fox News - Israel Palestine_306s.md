# More than 800 Hamas tunnel shafts discovered: IDF
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs)
*  You see, in this kind of a fight, the center of gravity is the civilian population. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=0.0s)]
*  And if you drive them into the arms of the enemy, you replace a tactical victory with [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=6.26s)]
*  a strategic defeat. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  So I have repeatedly made clear to Israel's leaders that protecting Palestinian civilians [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=12.8s)]
*  in Gaza is both a moral responsibility and a strategic imperative. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=18.580000000000002s)]
*  Well, the Pentagon joining the White House and calling for restraint by Israel in Gaza [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=25.12s)]
*  after the week-long ceasefire ended Friday. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=31.44s)]
*  In southern Gaza, Israel is urging residents to evacuate as it intensifies its bombardment [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  against Hamas. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  Shahar Azini, founder and principal at Fourth Dimension Strategies, joining me now. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=42.24s)]
*  He is also a former diplomat with Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=47.32s)]
*  So, I'm not sure if you caught Greg Palcott earlier in this newscast, but he reported [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=52.28s)]
*  that in the last five weeks, Israeli forces have found 800 shafts leading to Hamas tunnels. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=57.160000000000004s)]
*  Those shafts, as you well know, were near buildings like kindergartens, mosques, playgrounds. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=64.68s)]
*  That's their playbook. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=70.36s)]
*  And now IDF says that they destroyed 500 of those shafts. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=71.36s)]
*  So my question to you, Shahar, is, is it possible to minimize the killing of innocent Palestinian [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  people and pursue the annihilation of Hamas while the terrorists are using human shields? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=81.9s)]
*  Thank you, Arthur, for having me. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=89.62s)]
*  First of all, of course, Israel is very thankful to the U.S. for its support. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=91.02000000000001s)]
*  But let's make one thing very clear. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=94.78s)]
*  The Israel Defense Forces meet the highest standards of international law above all else [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=96.9s)]
*  and above all other armies across the world. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=101.80000000000001s)]
*  We have continuously done so for years. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=104.10000000000001s)]
*  We're actually, as we speak, writing the textbook on urban warfare against a barbaric, sadistic [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=106.94s)]
*  terror organization like Hamas. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=112.34s)]
*  The IDF has released a map of Gaza split into hundreds of zones where citizens can be directed [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=114.28s)]
*  where to go away from the combat zones. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=121.04s)]
*  In fact, Arthur, it's true that the IDF itself cares more for the lives of Palestinians in [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=123.7s)]
*  Gaza than Hamas itself. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=129.58s)]
*  Hamas has been using those Palestinians as human shields. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=131.62s)]
*  And there is an important message here, not just when it comes to Israel and Hamas. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=135.22s)]
*  If Hamas is allowed to use these human shields and using them to provide itself with immunity, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=139.74s)]
*  terrorist organizations all over the world are watching as these things occur in Gaza. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=146.38s)]
*  And if they take note, it's open season on using citizens everywhere as human shields. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=151.88s)]
*  And this is something that we all need to be both aware of and careful of. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=156.70000000000002s)]
*  Well, you know, some critics would say in terms of handing out the pamphlets and other [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=161.9s)]
*  communication to the residents of Palestinians who remain in Gaza to evacuate, reroute themselves [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=167.34s)]
*  to another area of safety, they're saying that it's very hard for that communication [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=174.7s)]
*  to get to them due to all the destruction. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=178.3s)]
*  But let me play for you, the Israeli. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=180.82s)]
*  Let me just say something about that, Arthur. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=182.5s)]
*  Just say something about this. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=184.74s)]
*  When the hostages were released by Hamas, the barbarians of Hamas, we saw so many Gazans [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=186.22s)]
*  surrounding them with their cell phones shining light onto them while they were hitting the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=191.94s)]
*  car and spitting at them. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=197.18s)]
*  So clearly, they have means of communication. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=198.74s)]
*  So I suggest they use those means also to get the messages from Israel, which also, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=201.34s)]
*  like you said, include the actual leaflets that the IDF is dropping on them. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=206.66s)]
*  I was going to play a sound from the Israeli minister of strategic affairs. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=210.22s)]
*  He was on ABC this morning. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=215.98s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=217.5s)]
*  When you have an enemy right on your border and you're doing everything to get the civilians [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=219.82s)]
*  of that enemy out of harm's way, I don't think any other country, including the United States, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=224.46s)]
*  I don't know if you ever face a situation like this, would take such great care. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=229.22s)]
*  Should protesters and world leaders be putting pressure on Hamas to surrender? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=235.3s)]
*  Isn't it high time to call them out for their atrocities? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=240.62s)]
*  And at the same time, there is a very simple way to bring back stability to the region. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=244.5s)]
*  If Hamas leaders surrender themselves and their weapons and stand trial for their crimes [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=249.20000000000002s)]
*  against humanity and the atrocities they perpetrated, then the Gaza Strip will experience no more [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=254.02s)]
*  of these defensive attacks of Israel. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=259.62s)]
*  October 7th happened after October 6th, so incredible quiet and an actual ceasefire. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=261.9s)]
*  And there is one more important point I want to mention, Arthur, when they use the word [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=267.74s)]
*  ceasefire, it's their language for rearrange and regroup before another attack on Israel. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=271.5s)]
*  The Hamas leaders mentioned it time and again. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=277.5s)]
*  We're not going to allow this anymore. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=279.58s)]
*  Shahir, Azimi, thank you very much. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=281.82s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=285.58s)]
*  Always a pleasure, Arthur. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2Yl5kGTWs&t=286.58s)]
