# White House 'doing all we can' to free American hostages
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T0UEdNCw70)
*  Artie, all the Biden administration closely monitoring the hostage transfer. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T0UEdNCw70&t=0.0s)]
*  U.S. officials adding that the White House is, quote, doing all we can to free American [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T0UEdNCw70&t=4.16s)]
*  hostages. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T0UEdNCw70&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  Lucas Tomlinson has more from Nantucket, Massachusetts, where the president just may be commenting [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T0UEdNCw70&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  on that first wave of released hostages. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T0UEdNCw70&t=15.620000000000001s)]
*  Right, Lucas? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T0UEdNCw70&t=18.48s)]
*  That's right, Kevin. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T0UEdNCw70&t=21.22s)]
*  Just moments ago, the White House saying President Biden will address the country in the next [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T0UEdNCw70&t=22.22s)]
*  30 minutes from here in Nantucket. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T0UEdNCw70&t=26.44s)]
*  No doubt talking about these hostages that were released today. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T0UEdNCw70&t=28.7s)]
*  And while it's good news that 24 hostages were released today, remember there's still [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T0UEdNCw70&t=31.9s)]
*  212 hostages that remain in captivity inside Gaza under Hamas. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T0UEdNCw70&t=36.06s)]
*  And of course, that includes up to 10 American citizens. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T0UEdNCw70&t=42.06s)]
*  President Biden, we heard earlier this week, sounding hopeful that up to three Americans [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T0UEdNCw70&t=46.18s)]
*  would be included in this initial group of 50 hostages that are scheduled, that are expected [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T0UEdNCw70&t=50.620000000000005s)]
*  to be released over the next four days. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T0UEdNCw70&t=55.6s)]
*  But today, no Americans were released. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T0UEdNCw70&t=58.92s)]
*  And certainly, the country holds its breath. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T0UEdNCw70&t=61.92s)]
*  And from around the world, we want to see Americans being released as included in this [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T0UEdNCw70&t=64.88s)]
*  for the hostages to get out. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T0UEdNCw70&t=70.52s)]
*  Now, that also includes Kevin, of course, three-year-old Abigail Adan. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T0UEdNCw70&t=71.8s)]
*  We heard her story. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T0UEdNCw70&t=76.76s)]
*  Her parents were killed. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T0UEdNCw70&t=78.38s)]
*  She waited for 16 hours, had to watch her parents slaughtered. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T0UEdNCw70&t=80.42s)]
*  One can only imagine the horror. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T0UEdNCw70&t=85.4s)]
*  Don't have to tell our viewers. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T0UEdNCw70&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  You look left, you look right on your couch right now. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T0UEdNCw70&t=88.42s)]
*  Look at your family members, your cousins, your daughters. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T0UEdNCw70&t=90.56s)]
*  Just horrific. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T0UEdNCw70&t=93.98s)]
*  And certainly, her reintegration into the world, it'll be quite dramatic. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T0UEdNCw70&t=94.98s)]
*  But right now, we can report that President Biden is scheduled to make an announcement [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T0UEdNCw70&t=100.44000000000001s)]
*  to address the country at 1.45 Eastern time here in Nantucket. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T0UEdNCw70&t=105.14000000000001s)]
*  We've been hearing yesterday when he visited a firehouse here in Nantucket that his fingers [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T0UEdNCw70&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  were crossed, hoping that some Americans would be released. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T0UEdNCw70&t=114.4s)]
*  That has not happened today, but the White House is expecting American hostages to be [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T0UEdNCw70&t=117.32000000000001s)]
*  included in this first group of 50 hostages. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T0UEdNCw70&t=121.52000000000001s)]
*  Kevin? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T0UEdNCw70&t=124.44000000000001s)]
*  Obviously, we'll be watching very carefully. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T0UEdNCw70&t=125.44000000000001s)]
*  Thank you for your reporting. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T0UEdNCw70&t=127.12s)]
