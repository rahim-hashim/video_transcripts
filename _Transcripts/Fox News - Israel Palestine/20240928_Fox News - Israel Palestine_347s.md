# People are ‘not talking about’ the fact that Iran is now ‘on notice’: Retired US gen
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [September 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk)
*  Lieutenant General David Tula with us right now, of course, the first deputy chief of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=0.0s)]
*  staff for intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance, headquartered at the U.S. Air Force. He knows [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=4.68s)]
*  of what he speaks. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=10.08s)]
*  You know, it's interesting, General, because there is the cockroach theory on these perpetrators [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=11.08s)]
*  that one goes and another just takes his place. And that's what Israel can look forward to [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=17.54s)]
*  for good or ill. The Israelis respond, we'll keep going after the cockroaches. Where does [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=24.04s)]
*  this stand in your eyes? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=28.74s)]
*  Well, I think taking out Nasrallah tops the Israeli Defense Forces efforts to decapitate [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=31.18s)]
*  Hezbollah's leadership. And as a result, that's thrown their command and control into chaos. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=38.78s)]
*  And they'll keep doing that. I mean, part of the message and part of what you see unfolding [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=44.82s)]
*  is the complete penetration and understanding of the Hezbollah organization. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=50.82s)]
*  And yeah, if they need to continue to take out cockroaches, they'll continue to do so. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=59.900000000000006s)]
*  But I think the capabilities that have been demonstrated plays directly into Israel's [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=65.98s)]
*  strategy to create the conditions to get the nearly 70,000 Israelis in northern Israel to [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=72.18s)]
*  return to their homes. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=79.46s)]
*  You know, you mentioned the Israelis, General, and already word has gone out for the entire [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=82.05999999999999s)]
*  country. I don't believe just limited to Tel Aviv or or central Israel to stop large [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=86.13999999999999s)]
*  gatherings of more than a thousand people. So that would effectively close theaters than [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=91.17999999999999s)]
*  that would be closing other large concert gatherings and the like. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=96.06s)]
*  So Israel's prepared for anything and everything, isn't it? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=100.02s)]
*  Well, it's a prudent measure in conjunction with their missile defense system in anticipation of [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=103.94s)]
*  how Iran, Hezbollah and Iran's other puppets, if you will, may respond. So once again, it's [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=111.42s)]
*  appropriate. Now, with respect to concerns about possible escalation, Neil, I wanted to offer that, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=123.46s)]
*  you know, one of the things that people aren't talking about is Iranian leadership's now on [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=130.14s)]
*  notice of what might happen to them. So I think this event over the last, well, yesterday with [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=133.85999999999999s)]
*  taking out the Hezbollah leadership as well as IGRC leadership may in fact have a deterrent effect [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=141.98s)]
*  on Iranian direct action against Israel because they understand the consequences if they did that. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=150.45999999999998s)]
*  So peace comes through strength and Israel just demonstrated how strong they are. And I think that [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=157.5s)]
*  Iran's going to pay attention to that. You know, it's interesting, General, you mentioned how [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=163.38s)]
*  Israel is handling this apparently on its own, not running any of this by the United States or the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=169.86s)]
*  White House more to the point. Now, that might not really be the case, but we already know Defense [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=174.82s)]
*  Secretary Austin has stressed that the U.S. is determined to prevent Iran and Iranian-backed [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=178.94s)]
*  partners and proxies from exploiting this situation, expanding the conflict. But he [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=184.22s)]
*  emphasized yesterday as well that we were not part of the planning or even, he didn't say it in so [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=189.78s)]
*  many words, had a heads up on these attacks on Israel's part. What did you make of that? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=196.14s)]
*  Well, I think quite frankly, it's basic military operational prudence. Clearly, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=201.45999999999998s)]
*  any kind of a leak could eliminate or prevent what the Israeli Defense Forces were able to [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=211.85999999999999s)]
*  do yesterday. So it's simply a matter of achieving surprise and protecting all your [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=220.33999999999997s)]
*  moves in advance. And I wouldn't chalk it up to anything other than that. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=228.26s)]
*  General, real quickly while I have you, no comments, and I've been sort of scouring the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=232.85999999999999s)]
*  press not only last night after my regular show, but preparing for this weekend show. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=237.82s)]
*  Nothing from the likes of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the UAE, some of the more moderate members of [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=242.22s)]
*  the Arab world who've, they might have been warning earlier in the week about Israel not [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=247.85999999999999s)]
*  expanding or threatening to expand the war, but that had more to do with ignoring calls for a [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=252.5s)]
*  ceasefire. We forget that some of those countries, particularly Saudi Arabia, have serious issues [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=256.78s)]
*  with Iran, and that is put it mildly. And they might welcome all of this. What do you think? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=263.74s)]
*  No, I think you put your finger on it, Neil. That's exactly right. Iran is absolutely a [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=268.46000000000004s)]
*  critical adversary of the GCC states, and they are more than happy to see Israel accomplish the [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=277.82s)]
*  objectives that it has and to deter Iran and put it into its place. Now, Neil, one more thing before [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=289.1s)]
*  I know you got to go, but let me also offer that recent IDF successes demonstrate the importance [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=295.82000000000005s)]
*  of having both a strong air force as well as an effective missile defense system and the options [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=301.74s)]
*  that they provide for a nation's security. Unfortunately, the United States Air Force [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=307.98s)]
*  has been allowed to atrophy to the extent that today we have the oldest and the smallest air [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=312.86s)]
*  force in our history, and our missile defenses are not adequate to meet the demands of our own [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=317.42s)]
*  national defense strategy. So reversing this situation has got to be a priority to the next [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=322.7s)]
*  administration, regardless of who gets elected. General, wise words all. I know you get tired [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=328.3s)]
*  of hearing this, General, but I've been not only thank you for joining us, but thank you for your [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=335.58000000000004s)]
*  incredible service to this country. You're very modest about that. If it were me, I'd be crowing [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=338.94s)]
*  about it all the time. But thank you again. Very good singing. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-Y0oFzWIk&t=344.94s)]
