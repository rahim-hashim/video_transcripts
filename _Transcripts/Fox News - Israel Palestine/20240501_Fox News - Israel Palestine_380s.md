# Columbia University student: We are not allowed to walk on campus
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [May 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk)
*  Xavier Westergaard and Daniela Simons who has also served in the IDF and is one of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=0.0s)]
*  students suing the school. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=5.66s)]
*  Welcome to both of you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=7.62s)]
*  I say every time you sit down, I just can't even imagine what you two have been going [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=9.38s)]
*  through and what it's been like for you. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=12.82s)]
*  And to now be students there and you can't even walk on your school's campus? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=15.3s)]
*  Thank you for having us first of all. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=20.3s)]
*  It's come to a point where really I'm speechless. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=23.6s)]
*  I have nothing to say. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=25.02s)]
*  I think back to October 7th and the events that ensued on campus shortly after and I [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=26.02s)]
*  think it never had to get to this point. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=30.82s)]
*  What do you think Xavier? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=35.62s)]
*  Two weeks ago I came onto the show and was afraid to walk on campus. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=37.46s)]
*  Now we don't have to be afraid about walking on campus because we're not even allowed to [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=41.68s)]
*  walk on campus. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=44.86s)]
*  The NYPD came in last night after two weeks of mixed messages and total, what's even the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=46.019999999999996s)]
*  word, lack of communication from the university. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=53.46s)]
*  The only communication that we got was that there were ongoing negotiations with some [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=55.74s)]
*  of the student leaders of these protests, these unauthorized protests which had already [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=59.04s)]
*  been condemned as being against university policy but the university didn't do anything. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=62.980000000000004s)]
*  What's the point of having to policy if you're not going to do anything? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=66.38s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=68.18s)]
*  And they only stepped in when the facilities workers were held hostage inside Hamilton [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=69.18s)]
*  Hall and in the email that was put out by the president, it was, she said the facilities [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=73.14s)]
*  workers were held hostage and then she listed the anti-Semitism. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=78.88s)]
*  It's always a forethought, right? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=82.02000000000001s)]
*  It's never about breaking university policy, it's as it relates to anti-Semitism. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=84.34s)]
*  No lawlessness, no rules, you can break the rules, there's no consequences. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=89.1s)]
*  And it seemed it struck you a moment ago when we were talking to Laura Ingraham and I reported [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=94.89999999999999s)]
*  what we heard from the White House and that was through the press secretary that the president [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=99.42s)]
*  of the United States still, amid this chaos all over the country, has not gotten on the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=103.74s)]
*  phone and spoken with a school administrator or a university president. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=107.78s)]
*  You said we really haven't heard anything that the White House has had to say. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=111.86s)]
*  We turned this exchange with our own Peter Ducey. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=114.66s)]
*  This was live in the briefing just a moment ago. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=118.24s)]
*  I want to get your thoughts out of this. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=120.82s)]
*  Some of these encampments, they had matching tents, we're being told that there are professional [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=124.34s)]
*  outside agitators involved. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=129.22s)]
*  We don't know if they're being paid to sow chaos by domestic folks or foreign entities. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=130.82s)]
*  Does President Biden want his administration to find out who is funding some of these protests? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=136.7s)]
*  What I can say, I cannot speak to the organizations that are being reported out on the ground. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=142.7s)]
*  That is not something for me to speak to. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=155.33999999999997s)]
*  That is obviously something that local government, local officials are going to speak to. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=158.38s)]
*  They'll have better information on that. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=165.9s)]
*  What we have said, and I don't think I've iterated that yet from here, is that the DOJ [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=168.86s)]
*  and FBI is going to continue to offer support to universities and colleges in respect to [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=173.42000000000002s)]
*  federal laws. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=180.74s)]
*  So that is something that the DOJ and FBI is doing. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=182.34s)]
*  As far as local organizations and what is all being reported on the ground, that is [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=185.22s)]
*  something that local law enforcement certainly is looking into. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=190.70000000000002s)]
*  I understand that President Biden historically has spoken very forcefully about anti-Semitism, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=195.34s)]
*  but this week he's not. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=202.85999999999999s)]
*  He's MIA. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=203.85999999999999s)]
*  Is he that worried about losing the youth vote with these protesters? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=204.85999999999999s)]
*  I'm going to be mindful. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=209.17999999999998s)]
*  You're talking about youth vote. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=210.17999999999998s)]
*  You're talking about 2024. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=211.17999999999998s)]
*  Support of young people. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=212.18s)]
*  I have to say what I have to say, and just give me a second. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=215.18s)]
*  So I'm not going to speak about somebody's doorbell. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=218.57999999999998s)]
*  Is that a doorbell? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=220.57999999999998s)]
*  Alarm. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=221.57999999999998s)]
*  An alarm. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=222.57999999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=223.57999999999998s)]
*  And I'll speak more broadly. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=224.9s)]
*  I can't speak to youth and support and voters. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=228.78s)]
*  That's not something I can do from here. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=232.02s)]
*  The president has taken a lot of policy actions here that he knows that young people care [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=234.06s)]
*  about. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=242.06s)]
*  I mean, it struck me just there. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=243.06s)]
*  I said it to you. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=244.42000000000002s)]
*  They're referencing reports from the ground. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=245.98000000000002s)]
*  This is the White House. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=248.5s)]
*  They can get any of that information firsthand. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=249.86s)]
*  Why are they not? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=253.02s)]
*  Any conversation between the White House and the university is a two-way street. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=255.10000000000002s)]
*  So I don't know why President Biden or his team haven't reached out to Manu Shafik. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=258.66s)]
*  But the real question for me is why my president of the University of Manu Shafik hasn't sought [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=262.58s)]
*  more outside support for this. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=266.86s)]
*  For us, this is a crisis. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=268.38s)]
*  We've been warning about this being a crisis for Jewish students on campus for the last [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=269.54s)]
*  six months, and only now they're responding. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=273.02s)]
*  We've been telling people that these protests are not pro-Palestine. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=275.5s)]
*  They're anti-Semitic. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=279.3s)]
*  They're anti-Israel. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=280.3s)]
*  They were going to inevitably escalate and become violent, and now they have. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=281.74s)]
*  She kept saying that these are mostly peaceful, that there's just a few students that are [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=285.66s)]
*  involved in the bad stuff, the vile rhetoric, the anti-Semitic words. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=290.38000000000005s)]
*  What do you say to that? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=294.46000000000004s)]
*  I say that it's the university's responsibility to educate these students on what is anti-Semitism [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=296.12s)]
*  and what is not. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=301.94000000000005s)]
*  There's an anti-Semitism task force, and that's great. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=303.14000000000004s)]
*  But when they're not teaching students why this is hateful, that's a problem. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=305.78s)]
*  And we're seeing it. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=312.02s)]
*  They're just becoming more and more extreme because the university has failed to step in. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=313.29999999999995s)]
*  In fact, is it fair to say they're teaching them the exact opposite? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=316.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=319.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=320.5s)]
*  Wow, that's powerful. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=321.5s)]
*  What is your message? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=322.7s)]
*  What is your message? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=323.7s)]
*  If you had the ear of the White House today, what could be done from your view? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=324.7s)]
*  You have seen this firsthand. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=330.46s)]
*  You're experiencing the threats, the vile rhetoric. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=332.02s)]
*  You can't even go to your classes anymore. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=334.94s)]
*  There are people who can't even graduate. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=337.54s)]
*  What is your message, Xavier? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=339.54s)]
*  There needs to be strong, unequivocal condemnation of the actions that have happened on these [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=341.1s)]
*  campuses. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=345.22s)]
*  They can't shift the blame from faceless outside agitators away from the students on our campus [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=346.28000000000003s)]
*  who are engaging in this despicable way. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=351.54s)]
*  And there needs to be a serious review of how the universities are funded because if [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=354.54s)]
*  they're receiving funding from the federal or state government, that has to come with [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=357.82s)]
*  a lot of strings. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=360.94s)]
*  And if they can't protect our rights as Jewish students, they shouldn't be receiving a dime. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=361.94s)]
*  We appreciate both of you joining us. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBjim1UCMk&t=365.78s)]
