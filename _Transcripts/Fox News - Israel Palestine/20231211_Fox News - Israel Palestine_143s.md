# Netanyahu: This is the beginning of the end of Hamas
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ5e9fgLpeA)
*  104 IDF soldiers have been killed fighting Hamas in Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ5e9fgLpeA&t=0.0s)]
*  That according to local media. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ5e9fgLpeA&t=7.28s)]
*  Six others hurt in a Hezbollah drone attack yesterday. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ5e9fgLpeA&t=8.64s)]
*  Trey Yanks live for us in southern Israel with the very latest Trey. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ5e9fgLpeA&t=12.0s)]
*  Hey Todd, good morning. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ5e9fgLpeA&t=15.44s)]
*  I do want to start with some breaking news here. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ5e9fgLpeA&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  Just a few minutes ago Hamas fired rockets towards central Israel. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ5e9fgLpeA&t=20.16s)]
*  66 days into the war they are still targeting major cities like Tel Aviv. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ5e9fgLpeA&t=24.52s)]
*  We do understand there was one direct impact and at least one person was lightly injured. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ5e9fgLpeA&t=29.56s)]
*  This comes as Israeli forces continue to push deeper into the Gaza Strip behind me focusing [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ5e9fgLpeA&t=34.6s)]
*  their efforts on the Jabalia neighborhood in northern Gaza overnight. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ5e9fgLpeA&t=39.76s)]
*  You can see here in this video a reconnaissance unit operating in that area. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ5e9fgLpeA&t=43.6s)]
*  They are engaged in close quarters combat. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ5e9fgLpeA&t=48.4s)]
*  You're looking here at the Nahal Infantry Brigades 931st Battalion. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ5e9fgLpeA&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  They say that Hamas fighters had prepared an ambush but were thwarted. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ5e9fgLpeA&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  Since the ground operation began as you mentioned, 104 Israeli soldiers have been killed. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ5e9fgLpeA&t=58.96s)]
*  As fierce battles continue across Gaza, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had this [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ5e9fgLpeA&t=63.88s)]
*  warning for Hamas. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ5e9fgLpeA&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  In recent days, dozens of Hamas terrorists have been surrendering to our forces. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ5e9fgLpeA&t=71.08s)]
*  They are laying down their weapons and handing themselves over to our heroic fighters. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ5e9fgLpeA&t=76.68s)]
*  It will take more time. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ5e9fgLpeA&t=81.92s)]
*  The war is in full swing. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ5e9fgLpeA&t=83.28s)]
*  But this is the beginning of the end of Hamas. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ5e9fgLpeA&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  I say to Hamas terrorists, it is over. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ5e9fgLpeA&t=88.0s)]
*  Don't die for Sinwar. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ5e9fgLpeA&t=91.52s)]
*  Surrender now. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ5e9fgLpeA&t=93.0s)]
*  Don't die for Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, Netanyahu says. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ5e9fgLpeA&t=97.0s)]
*  This comes as Israeli forces remain active on the northern front trying to push back [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ5e9fgLpeA&t=100.24s)]
*  from new threats against the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ5e9fgLpeA&t=104.72s)]
*  Just yesterday Israel's chief of staff, Herzay Halevi, visited troops there. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ5e9fgLpeA&t=107.56s)]
*  Israel has reportedly set a deadline for attempts to reach a diplomatic solution to push Hezbollah [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ5e9fgLpeA&t=111.44s)]
*  away from the Lebanese border. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ5e9fgLpeA&t=116.4s)]
*  But at this point, Israeli officials do not believe the diplomacy will work, likely leading [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ5e9fgLpeA&t=118.4s)]
*  to further military activity in the north. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ5e9fgLpeA&t=122.92s)]
*  Here on the southern front, all eyes do remain on Gaza. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ5e9fgLpeA&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  There are concerns that Hamas and Islamic Jihad could try to put new pressure and increase [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ5e9fgLpeA&t=128.84s)]
*  their threats against Israel when it comes to those 137 hostages still held in the Strip. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ5e9fgLpeA&t=133.36s)]
