# Netanyahu condemns 'monsters' in death of six hostages
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [September 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg)
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is speaking. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=2.2s)]
*  BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, U.S. Secretary of State for the United States of America, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=3.2s)]
*  United States of America, and the United States of America. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=7.42s)]
*  You see the happiness, you hear the lives, their lives stories, the happiness that they [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=10.42s)]
*  had, and all this light was destroyed, was all by a hand of monsters. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=15.76s)]
*  I told the families, and I repeat this again this evening, I apologize to you that we have [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=30.48s)]
*  been able to bring them back alive. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=42.72s)]
*  We were close, but we were not successful. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=45.82s)]
*  And I repeat again this evening, Israel will not act as if nothing has happened during [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=51.72s)]
*  this massacre. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=60.64s)]
*  Hamas will pay a very heavy price for this. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=63.16s)]
*  The war against the caxuses of evil and this specific one against Hamas, and also in the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=66.88000000000001s)]
*  north, we have set for ourselves four goals to destroy Hamas, eliminate it, bring back [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=77.56s)]
*  all our hostages, to assure that other will no longer be a threat to Israel, and to bring [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  back to the north our residents in security. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=94.56s)]
*  Three of these targets pass through one place, the Philadelphia Line. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=98.72s)]
*  This is the oxygen for Hamas, and I want to take a few minutes to—the significance [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=108.44s)]
*  of what is this line, the Philadelphia Line? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=115.98s)]
*  That's a gift to Israel's security to assure that we're not going to have another [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=120.76s)]
* —7 October, another 7 October, and another October 7, as Hamas has promised to do. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=126.76s)]
*  I want to show you, first of all, what we had over the years until we left this—this [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  is Egypt, Israel, he's here. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=143.96s)]
*  You see the Gaza Strip? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=147.5s)]
*  The distance to Tel Aviv is not that far, and it's just meters to the villages near [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=149.94s)]
*  it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=156.18s)]
*  From—to Eilat, this was an international border of Israel, from the sea to Eilat. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=157.86s)]
*  Please enlarge it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=166.94s)]
*  If you look this enlarge, you see all this. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=169.86s)]
*  It's all in the—we are controlling it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=173.3s)]
*  Ashkelon, Shterot, the kibbutzim, Kerem Shalom, and here on the bottom, Tzir Philadelphia, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=177.86s)]
*  the Philadelphia Line. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=185.78s)]
*  It's all in our control. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=188.26000000000002s)]
*  Now, if what happened is when we left Gaza, the lines remained, the border—they tried [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=192.82000000000002s)]
*  various—you went to the Marmara, Flotilla and others, but the land border, nothing came [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=202.3s)]
*  through. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=211.26000000000002s)]
*  But the minute we left the Gaza Strip back then and left the Philadelphia Line, it's [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=212.26000000000002s)]
*  actually the border between Gaza Strip and Israel. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=221.66s)]
*  The minute we left it, we had no blockage from massive insertion of war material, machines [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=225.06s)]
*  to create, to manufacture weapons, all by Iran financing it and planning it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=237.3s)]
*  And all these things you see here came in through the Philadelphia Strip Line and became [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=247.29999999999998s)]
*  a huge threat because there was no blockage there. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=252.78s)]
*  That's what happened. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=256.86s)]
*  And therefore, the question—and I'm being asked, if it was so bad, why didn't you conquer [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=259.26s)]
*  it? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=271.09999999999997s)]
*  Why didn't you conquer it? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=272.09999999999997s)]
*  And the answer is that we all the time tried naturally to attack it, especially after we [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=274.94s)]
*  left the Gaza Strip. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=285.5s)]
*  It continued after the Morsi regime, through Mubarak and always through. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=288.18s)]
*  They came in with weapons through the Philadelphia Line. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=295.1s)]
*  There were three operations that we fought, three of them I was in charge of as prime [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=302.34000000000003s)]
*  minister. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=310.46000000000004s)]
*  Naturally, we killed Jabir and thousands of terrorists, but there was no illegitimacy [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=312.46000000000004s)]
*  as far as international arena is concerned. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=323.54s)]
*  There wasn't an international or even national agreement to do that. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=328.98s)]
*  Now, the importance—I said this 20 years ago already. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=334.02s)]
*  Sharon declared in 2003 that we get out of Gaza. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=341.3s)]
*  Four months later, on 26th of March 2004, I described what are demands, the minimal [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=346.3s)]
*  The first mile is controlling all the lines for crossing into Gaza by air. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=356.74s)]
*  Land or sea, Philadelphia Line that separates with Egypt will not be—if we're going [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=366.54s)]
*  to—I wrote, I said, if we're going to give up on controlling the line between Egypt [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=373.26s)]
*  and Gaza, we'll have—when I resigned from the government, I told Prime Minister [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=379.53999999999996s)]
*  Sharon a letter of resignation. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=389.53999999999996s)]
*  As a minimum, I demanded that the Philadelphia Line should remain in our hands. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=392.38s)]
*  It's nothing new. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=399.34s)]
*  It was clear that if you don't have this line, there's going to be rearmament in [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=402.29999999999995s)]
*  there. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=408.42s)]
*  You're going to be creating a monster. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=409.42s)]
*  The axis of evil needs the Philadelphia Line for the same reason, and for that same reason [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=414.58s)]
*  we must control it. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=421.86s)]
*  Hamas insists that we should not be there, and for this reason I insist that we will [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=423.65999999999997s)]
*  stay there. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=431.38s)]
*  The presence on the Philadelphia Line is important strategically and nationally. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=435.09999999999997s)]
*  The world has to—we have to accept the fact that we are there. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=441.21999999999997s)]
*  What's wrong? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=444.62s)]
*  People tell me, we'll leave for 42 days and come back. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=445.62s)]
*  And we were already in this movie before. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=451.29999999999995s)]
*  We did this when we left Lebanon. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=455.65999999999997s)]
*  They said, the first missile, the first missile will go—comes in, we'll go back and reconquer [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=457.65999999999997s)]
*  it. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=463.82s)]
*  There was no international—overwhelming international support. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=464.82s)]
*  Well, they shot—they fired thousands of missiles, and there was no international support. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=467.98s)]
*  Now, when we did this, they said, what's—the first missile that flies in, we're going [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=474.86s)]
*  to go into after 2003. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=485.86s)]
*  We'll go in. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=487.65999999999997s)]
*  Twenty years passed, and we did not go back in. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=488.65999999999997s)]
*  Service says there's not a problem to go back in. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=492.41999999999996s)]
*  There is a problem. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=495.05999999999995s)]
*  And how? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=496.58s)]
*  And how there will be a problem? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=497.58s)]
*  It's not easy to do that. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=499.53999999999996s)]
*  It's not a question of tactical or military. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=501.58s)]
*  It's a matter of huge—the whole world exerts tremendous political force not to go [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=505.29999999999995s)]
*  back once we go out, not to go back in. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=514.66s)]
*  I tell you how hard it was to—I withstood this pressure. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=517.7800000000001s)]
*  It was how hard for us to get into Rafiach. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=524.3000000000001s)]
*  Look what we paid for it. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=527.2600000000001s)]
*  We had huge pressure on us not to go to the ICC a day or two before the decision. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=529.22s)]
*  They knew we were going to make the decision. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=535.1800000000001s)]
*  We had an embargo of weapons. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=538.34s)]
*  We paid with lives of our soldiers. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=542.58s)]
*  So this is nothing compared to what we're going to have to have against us if we get [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=546.66s)]
*  out—and everybody knows the importance of this. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=550.54s)]
*  We want us to end the war. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=554.54s)]
*  That's what they all want—that we should end the war. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=555.54s)]
*  And this line is different from all the other lines. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=559.82s)]
*  It's central. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=563.58s)]
*  It decides our entire future. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=564.58s)]
*  Its importance is huge for us, but for the world who wants to end the war. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=568.78s)]
*  And the last thing they want is for us to go back. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=575.1800000000001s)]
*  They're going to have overwhelming force on us. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=577.1800000000001s)]
*  The UN and I don't want to go into details. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=581.26s)]
*  I know what's going to happen. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=583.5s)]
*  Why should we get into this trap? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=587.82s)]
*  They tell us it's possible. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=591.7s)]
*  I'm telling you that this will not bring the hostages back. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=593.66s)]
*  On the contrary, I want to tell you, when we got into Philadelphia— [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=599.82s)]
*  only then we sensed that we felt a difference. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=605.0999999999999s)]
*  For long months after the first transaction, Hamas didn't move a bit. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=609.9s)]
*  You must declare an advance, end of the war, and to leave the Gaza Strip. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=616.42s)]
*  And, in effect, let us control our Gaza again, Hamas. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=623.02s)]
*  The first crack—this doesn't bring release of the hostages, but the first crack in this [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=627.9399999999999s)]
*  when we got into a film, we controlled Philadelphia Line and the Rafiach gate, and then suddenly [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=635.0600000000001s)]
*  Hamas started to talk to us. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=643.14s)]
*  Then they moved backward because they thought Iran will save them or Hezbollah will come [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=646.62s)]
*  and help them save them. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=651.34s)]
*  Now, they're hoping that international pressure or internal Israeli pressure will [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=653.34s)]
*  affect it, but the first change for a possible was because we took control of the Philadelphia [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ033K_6Flg&t=659.82s)]
