# Congress pressured to pull funding from colleges over anti-Israel protests
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [May 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs)
*  Alright, let's bring in New York Congresswoman Nicole Maliotakis who sits on the House Committee [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=0.0s)]
*  on Ways and Means. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  She joins us now. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=6.04s)]
*  Congresswoman, good morning to you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=7.72s)]
*  Your reaction to what's unfolding out of UCLA and also what unfolded last night on [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=9.4s)]
*  the campus of Columbia. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=14.08s)]
*  Well, first, my hat's off to the NYPD for doing an amazing job. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=15.4s)]
*  They've been able to de-escalate the situation within one hour. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=20.48s)]
*  They removed the agitators. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=23.6s)]
*  It's a shame that the university president took so long. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=27.4s)]
*  When we were on the campus with speaker Mike Johnson last week, we met with the university [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=30.16s)]
*  president. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=34.76s)]
*  We warned that her negotiating with these students was not going to be a winning strategy, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=35.76s)]
*  that she needed to use authority, and that she should have let the NYPD on campus sooner, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=41.32s)]
*  but unfortunately she'd allowed it to escalate. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=46.959999999999994s)]
*  We're glad there were no injuries and that our NYPD officers were safe. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=48.68s)]
*  What I'll say is that, again, this is lawlessness that has been allowed to fester in this country. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=53.28s)]
*  In New York, for example, there have been people arrested, but I'm sure by the time [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=59.24s)]
*  Americans are waking up this morning, they've been released back onto the street due to [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  the radical bail laws of Governor Kathy Hokel and the Democrats who run our state. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=67.4s)]
*  And to DAs like Alvin Brack, who are more concerned with prosecuting President Trump, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=72.60000000000001s)]
*  everyone else gets reduced or dropped charges. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=78.12s)]
*  That's what's happening and that's the reality that we face under Democrat-run governments [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=81.0s)]
*  at the city and state level. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=85.56s)]
*  But I think that there's a larger issue here that we as members of Congress need to tackle. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=87.48s)]
*  So much taxpayer money is going to these universities. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=92.68s)]
*  And we need to look at stripping federal funding from those institutions that allow anti-Semitism [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=96.72s)]
*  to persist, that do not hold professors and staff and students accountable. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=103.68s)]
*  And that is why I've introduced legislation a couple of months ago that will do that. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=109.68s)]
*  I hope the House will take up that legislation, as well as another bill that I authored that [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=113.28s)]
*  would strip visas from foreign students participating in this activity. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=118.04s)]
*  When you look at the funding for colleges, it makes absolute and total sense. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=123.16000000000001s)]
*  The only problem for getting this through Congress is you have a Democratic party that [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=126.52000000000001s)]
*  relies on the college vote, relies on the administration, faculty and student vote for [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=131.52s)]
*  kind of like 90 percent of who makes them up. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=136.32s)]
*  That's an exaggeration, but the overall point is that's going to be really tough to get through. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=139.35999999999999s)]
*  Another point I'd like to make before I answer my question is the New York DA seems to love [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  to charge conspiracy when there isn't one, i.e. the Trump case. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=146.92s)]
*  Maybe he should prepare conspiracy charges for what we're seeing on the streets of New [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=151.23999999999998s)]
*  York and in Los Angeles. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=154.95999999999998s)]
*  But with regard to the federal response, you're talking about a legislative response that [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=156.72s)]
*  follows the money. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=160.84s)]
*  What do you want to see our armed Fed response be? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=162.0s)]
*  Should we have the National Guard come out in these states? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=166.52s)]
*  Should Joe Biden mobilize, I don't know, the army or some type of larger body to get into [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=169.56s)]
*  these universities and put a stop to this? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=176.4s)]
*  Because as Carly said earlier, this is not America. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=178.76000000000002s)]
*  The scenes in Colombia, the scenes in UCLA, this isn't America and can't be America going [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=181.8s)]
*  forward, Congresswoman. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=186.76000000000002s)]
*  Yes, certainly where we've seen violence, those images from UCLA with people using bats, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=189.76000000000002s)]
*  that is a situation where the National Guard should have been called immediately. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=195.32s)]
*  NYPD in New York should have been allowed on the campus earlier on. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=199.28s)]
*  The issue that we have is that a lot of what the news is reporting is it's actually worse [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=204.04s)]
*  when you actually talk to the students that are on the campus. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=209.12s)]
*  The campus, the students at Columbia told us straight out they were spat on, they were [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=212.76s)]
*  assaulted, there were racial slurs that were being used against them. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=218.4s)]
*  There were some serious issues there, swastikas on the campus. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=225.6s)]
*  They should not be subjected to this type of anti-Semitism. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=227.88s)]
*  So we need to also look at the ties. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=231.28s)]
*  These student organizations, do they have terrorist associations? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=234.44s)]
*  Are they being funded by foreign entities? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=238.32s)]
*  As a member of Ways and Means, one of the things we're looking at are these nonprofit [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  organizations that are receiving foreign money. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=243.92000000000002s)]
*  We need to crack down on this foreign money that is infiltrating our country. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=247.10000000000002s)]
*  Is it coming from terrorist organizations? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=251.96s)]
*  Is it coming from the CCP? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=255.12s)]
*  And also what I'm going to be doing is introducing legislation that would prohibit these nonprofits [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=257.04s)]
*  that receive foreign funding from being able to have an affiliated PAC that goes out and [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=261.52s)]
*  does this type of activity and influences, quite frankly, our elections. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=267.48s)]
*  We can't receive foreign money. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=272.64s)]
*  Why are these nonprofits that receive foreign money allowed to have affiliated PACs? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=274.76s)]
*  So that's something that we're also looking at. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=279.64s)]
*  This is a time to really get to the bottom of what's going on here with regards to funding, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=281.47999999999996s)]
*  with regards to terrorist ties, with regards to these organizations that have received [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=286.96s)]
*  tax benefits, tax benefits from the government, from the taxpayers, and then in turn are committing [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=293.47999999999996s)]
*  these anti-American, anti-Semitic activities and indoctrination of our young students across [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=300.12s)]
*  America. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=305.23999999999995s)]
*  Congresswoman, Columbia University Classics professor, his name is Joseph Howley. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=306.23999999999995s)]
*  He released a statement last night and he said that Columbia's faculty says in part [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=311.32s)]
*  that they hold university leadership responsible for this moment and that leadership will bear [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=317.0s)]
*  responsibility for any injuries that may occur during any police action. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=321.55999999999995s)]
*  He doesn't want police on campus. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=326.32s)]
*  He also said in poor NYPD presence in our neighborhood endangers our entire community. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=328.28s)]
*  Armed police entering our campus places students and everyone else on campus at risk. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=334.8s)]
*  I know that there's been a lot of criticism when it comes to Columbia University's president, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  but given that statement and the pressures on her, is she really the problem here? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=346.2s)]
*  Well, I think she's a weak leader. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=350.64s)]
*  I've called for a resignation because she allowed this to fester and escalate. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=353.64s)]
*  As soon as she took the stand that she was going to negotiate with these students and [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=357.92s)]
*  not use her authority as an administrator to just implement the rules, expel and suspend [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=362.72s)]
*  the students that were participating in this chaos and the anti-Semitism. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=368.52000000000004s)]
*  She failed to protect her students and keep them safe. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=372.44000000000005s)]
*  What I will also say is it's very troubling some of the rhetoric that we've seen from [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=376.88000000000005s)]
*  or we've heard from the professors, right? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=381.0s)]
*  Some have praised openly Hamas, Hezbollah. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=384.06s)]
*  One was actually hired after taking to social media following the October 7th attack, praising [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=387.8s)]
*  Hamas and Hezbollah. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=394.12s)]
*  So why are individuals like that teaching our young people? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=396.0s)]
*  I will also say that, look, what you're hearing from some of those professors, I mean, it's [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=400.16s)]
*  the likes of what AOC and other socialists are saying. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=404.6s)]
*  That is the socialist Marxist belief. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=407.84000000000003s)]
*  They are anti-police. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=410.04s)]
*  They are the same people who were in charge of the defund police movement across America [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=411.04s)]
*  in the summer of 2020. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=416.52000000000004s)]
*  They don't believe in authority. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=418.52000000000004s)]
*  They don't believe in rules and laws and accountability. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=420.0s)]
*  They believe in just unlawless, they believe in lawlessness. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=423.40000000000003s)]
*  And that is part of the problem. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=427.64s)]
*  And this is what the Democrat left wing believes in. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=428.92s)]
*  They are anti-police. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=431.6s)]
*  They are pro-socialism, pro-Marxist. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=433.12s)]
*  And sadly, the far left is also pro-Hamas, pro-terrorism. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=436.40000000000003s)]
*  Congressman Nicole Malliotakis, we appreciate your time this morning and your insight on [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=441.24s)]
*  this. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQuyNt0CWDs&t=444.32s)]
