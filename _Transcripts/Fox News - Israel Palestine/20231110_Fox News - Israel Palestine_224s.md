# Hamas will not 'pause' attacks on Israeli forces: Lt. Col. Lerner
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q)
*  let's bring in IDF spokesperson, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=2.04s)]
*  Thank you for joining me. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=3.5s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=5.32s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=6.16s)]
*  Netanyahu in that same interview [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=7.28s)]
*  with Brett Bear said he agreed [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=9.24s)]
*  with Biden's assessment that took [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=11.28s)]
*  a little longer than he would have [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  liked to have those four hour [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=15.42s)]
*  pauses to let civilians through, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=17.44s)]
*  and he referenced specifically [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=19.16s)]
*  battle conditions on the ground. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=20.52s)]
*  Explain to our viewers why these [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=22.22s)]
*  pauses could be so challenging from [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=24.28s)]
*  the perspective of what's happening [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  on the battlefield. Yeah, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=27.98s)]
*  good evening Kaylee. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=29.64s)]
*  Indeed, this is a huge challenge [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=30.68s)]
*  that we are facing because you know [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=32.68s)]
*  when you want to conduct a humanitarian [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=34.84s)]
*  pause for any reason, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=37.0s)]
*  if there is a battle ongoing, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=38.2s)]
*  then it's pretty hard to pause that [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=40.08s)]
*  because we are only there's only one [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=42.08s)]
*  side that actually is willing to [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=44.2s)]
*  conduct any sort of humanitarian pause. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=45.92s)]
*  Hamas are not part of this idea. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=47.88s)]
*  Obviously they have no interest [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=50.24s)]
*  in safeguarding their own people. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=51.96s)]
*  Everything they do implies that [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=53.72s)]
*  they are doing everything to put [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=55.400000000000006s)]
*  the Palestinian people in a position [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=57.400000000000006s)]
*  of the Palestinians of Gaza at risk, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=59.48s)]
*  and therefore when we are conducting [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=61.8s)]
*  a humanitarian pause as we have [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=63.64s)]
*  done for today and yesterday, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=65.64s)]
*  just potentially puts them at risk. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=67.36s)]
*  Our goal is to evacuate people [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=69.28s)]
*  from the combat zone in order [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=71.24s)]
*  to get them out of harm's way. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=73.16s)]
*  Whereas Hamas wants to keep them input, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=75.28s)]
*  keep them put, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=77.44s)]
*  keep them in harm's way and [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=78.36s)]
*  jeopardize them even more. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=80.22s)]
*  This is a war with a war that [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=81.52s)]
*  we are determined to win. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=83.92s)]
*  We are fighting it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=85.64s)]
*  I would say extensively close to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  close. Close centered urban warfare, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=89.24000000000001s)]
*  confronting the enemy on the battleground, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=92.48s)]
*  and I would say advancing every day [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=95.32000000000001s)]
*  a bit more and closing the news [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=98.08000000000001s)]
*  around Hamas is next. So you've [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=100.88000000000001s)]
*  advanced all the way into Gaza City [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=103.36s)]
*  there where you found the military [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=106.0s)]
*  quarter position conveniently [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=108.44s)]
*  right by Al-Shifa Hospital. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=109.92s)]
*  The goal of Hamas is to up the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=111.88000000000001s)]
*  civilian body count there in Gaza. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=114.88000000000001s)]
*  What have you found militarily [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  by that Al-Shifa Hospital? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=120.28s)]
*  So the military quarter was [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=123.52s)]
*  basically a compound with all of [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  the military capabilities of Hamas, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=128.16s)]
*  their command and control center, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=130.28s)]
*  rocket launchers, weapons manufacturing, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=132.35999999999999s)]
*  all of the tools that they had [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=134.24s)]
*  for their terrorism were in [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=136.76s)]
*  this compound at vast compound. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=138.72s)]
*  We killed around 50 of their [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=140.76s)]
*  terrorists that were in it in [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=143.07999999999998s)]
*  our engagements with them, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=145.28s)]
*  and indeed it's just a skip and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=146.76s)]
*  a hop away from the the Shifa Hospital. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=148.95999999999998s)]
*  And so we know that and we've [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=151.6s)]
*  revealed both to Fox and to others [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=154.2s)]
*  the extent of how Hamas is using [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=156.79999999999998s)]
*  Shifa Hospital and other hospitals [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=159.32s)]
*  for terrorist activities as a basis [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=161.23999999999998s)]
*  as basis of operations in. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=163.72s)]
*  I would say in contradiction to [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=165.72s)]
*  international humanitarian law and [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=167.92s)]
*  definitely in contradiction to [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=169.64s)]
*  the laws of armed conflict, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=171.2s)]
*  we are determined to destroy Hamas. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=173.2s)]
*  They never ever wield the sword [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=175.72s)]
*  of death above our heads again. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  They have to be banished from [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=179.68s)]
*  the realm of existence. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=181.44s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel Lerner, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=182.6s)]
*  I only have 15 seconds here, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=183.76s)]
*  but I just want to confirm this fact with you. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=184.88s)]
*  It was in the Times of Israel that [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  they found a tunnel down to the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=188.68s)]
*  entrance to the tunnel underneath [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=191.72s)]
*  the bedroom of a child in northern Gaza. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=197.36s)]
*  In more than one instance, wow. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=199.48000000000002s)]
*  Unbelievable Lieutenant Colonel Lerner. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyzNXaOIH-Q&t=202.44s)]
