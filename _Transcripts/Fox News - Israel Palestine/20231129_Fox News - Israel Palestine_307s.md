# Emotional moment shows moment Israeli mother found out her kids would be released
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0)
*  85 of the roughly 240 people taken hostage by Hamas have now been released and that includes [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=0.0s)]
*  these two beautiful siblings, 12-year-old Erez and his 16-year-old sister, Sahar Calderon. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=9.08s)]
*  This is video of their mother getting the call that her kids were finally coming home. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=15.34s)]
*  But as I transition back to their new normal, their father is still being held hostage by [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=20.88s)]
*  Hamas and their grandmother and cousin were both killed on October 7th by the terrorists. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=34.64s)]
*  Abby Ohn is the cousin of the Calderon family and she joins me now. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=40.019999999999996s)]
*  Abby, I mean this video could bring a tear to anybody's eye and we spoke to their mother a day [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=44.599999999999994s)]
*  after Erez had his birthday. He had his birthday in captivity and we've been praying for them ever [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=50.12s)]
*  since. It's so good to see that they're finally home with their family, their mother, where they [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=55.879999999999995s)]
*  belong. How are they doing? They're doing physically okay. Look, they weren't wounded, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  which is positive, but they were malnourished. They came home much skinnier than they were 52 [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=69.4s)]
*  days prior, but they're in one piece and they're home with their mother and now we are fighting for [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=74.78s)]
*  their father, Ofer, and for every hostage that's still there. Yeah, their father is still being [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=80.22s)]
*  held hostage. I believe that the day that they were released, all the children who were released in [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=85.98s)]
*  that group still had a father in captivity and you have to wonder if that is by design, by some [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=90.74000000000001s)]
*  sort of psychological torture by Hamas to instill on these children still with the fear that [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=97.1s)]
*  one of their parents is being held. Exactly that. It's amazing that they're home. It's everything we [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=104.7s)]
*  have prayed and fought for and at the same time, you can't begin to heal until the family is whole, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=111.22s)]
*  until every single hostage is home because they're all part of one big family and we need every single [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=116.74000000000001s)]
*  one of them home. Yeah, and Abby, I mean, a family whole, your family will forever be changed. Their [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=122.86s)]
*  and their cousin were murdered on October 7th, so this is going to be a really long road to recovery. Are they aware that their loved ones are no longer with us? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=129.52s)]
*  They know. I actually believe they learned in captivity, which is again what you were saying, this kind of psychological terror. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=139.52s)]
*  We're beginning to hear reports from the children coming out, how hard it was for them and how horrific. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=146.52s)]
*  They didn't have much food. They weren't able to go to the bathroom when they needed and we're hearing that the children in general are coming out and speaking in [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=153.52s)]
*  whispers because they were told they can't make noise and so they're afraid to use their own voice. The doctors are saying they wish they would cry. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=162.52s)]
*  They wish they would scream, but they're generally very silent. Yeah, and I was reading about what these children could go through and everybody's going to process emotions differently. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=170.52s)]
*  Some will get maybe random bursts of anger. Some will remain very quiet and it is great to know that these two beautiful children have a loving family. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=180.52s)]
*  You being one of the members that will support them throughout their lives in terms of their physical condition. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=189.52s)]
*  I read a half a slice of bread a day for them. Is that true? Oh, my goodness. So everyone came home having lost a lot of weight. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=195.52s)]
*  And now the first priority is just to look at their physical health, to make sure that they have what they need, to make sure they have the food that they want. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=204.52s)]
*  They asked for yogurt with grapes and granola and to make sure that they're physically OK. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=212.52s)]
*  And then to move on to the next part of the process, which is the emotional and the trauma. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=218.52s)]
*  But at the same time, to keep fighting for their father because we can bring him home, we can bring all of them home. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=223.52s)]
*  We just have to keep fighting and keep raising our voices and keep talking about it and make sure that we keep bringing one by one or as the case is, 10 by 10, bringing them all home. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=229.52s)]
*  Yeah. So this is the final day of the extended ceasefire. Do you think that it should be extended again? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=239.52s)]
*  It's so complicated because it's not a release of hostages. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=246.52s)]
*  It's an exchange of hostages for criminals, for prisoners. And every single day that this this goes on, our soldiers are in even more danger. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=251.52s)]
*  And so I don't believe that I have the ability to know exactly what should happen. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=262.52s)]
*  But as a member of a family that has people being held there, I want to see every single hostage out as soon as possible. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=267.52s)]
*  And if that means extending it, if that's possible, that would be amazing. Yeah. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=274.52s)]
*  And that you're absolutely right. It is such a complicated situation and a situation that Israel certainly did not ask for it to be in this horrific position. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=278.52s)]
*  But it is so good to see a Rez and Sahar back with their family. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=287.52s)]
*  And I think a lot of us will remember forever the happy screams of their mom when she finally got word that her beautiful children are coming home to her where they belong. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=291.52s)]
*  Abby Owen, thank you so much for joining us. Keeping the story alive. Thanks for having me. Of course. Absolutely. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3n1kbNAnY0&t=301.52s)]
