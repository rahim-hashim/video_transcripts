# Tom Cotton: The police should arrest these pro-Hamas lunatics
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM)
*  Joining me now is Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator, great to see you tonight. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=2.56s)]
*  It was pretty pathetic yesterday [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=4.36s)]
*  that protesters were cementing themselves, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=5.8s)]
*  we're looking at video now, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=8.84s)]
*  into barrels and pipes so they couldn't be removed. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=10.64s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=15.16s)]
*  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=17.52s)]
*  Let go of the bar. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=19.68s)]
*  Come on, let go of the bar. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=20.84s)]
*  Stop! [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  Let go of the bar. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=23.92s)]
*  Squeeze my hand! [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=24.76s)]
*  Let go of the bar. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=25.6s)]
*  Stop, you are hurting me! [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=26.44s)]
*  Let go of the bar. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=28.2s)]
*  He's free, he's free. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=29.92s)]
*  Take him out. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=31.6s)]
*  You got the arms? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=33.84s)]
*  Yep. Okay. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=34.68s)]
*  You got a set on? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=35.52s)]
*  Goodbye. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=36.36s)]
*  Senator, this is just one of the absurd videos, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=38.6s)]
*  but you've been criticized for saying [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=41.56s)]
*  people should take matters into your own hands [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=43.68s)]
*  to get them out of the way. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=46.06s)]
*  Do you stand by that tonight? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=49.0s)]
*  Ha, ha, ha. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=51.72s)]
*  Of course I do, Laura. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=53.040000000000006s)]
*  I mean, what do you expect people to do [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=54.2s)]
*  when they've gotta get to work, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=55.56s)]
*  they've gotta pick up a kid, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=56.88s)]
*  maybe they're trying to take care of an ailing parent, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=58.24s)]
*  heaven forbid, they're trying to get a loved one [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=60.28s)]
*  to the hospital. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  All of these pro-Hamas lunatics can, I don't know, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=63.88s)]
*  get a permit and protest in a park [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=67.14s)]
*  and wave around their little Hamas flags [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=69.52s)]
*  if they wanna make fools of themselves, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=71.12s)]
*  but they have no right to block traffic, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=72.44s)]
*  especially on major highways or city streets [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  when other people are trying to go about their business. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=78.2s)]
*  And yes, what the police should do [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=80.84s)]
*  is get there promptly and arrest these people [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=82.76s)]
*  and throw the book at them if they're allowed to [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=84.88s)]
*  by their often left-wing Democratic mayors. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=86.64s)]
*  But in the meantime, these lunatics shouldn't be surprised [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=88.96s)]
*  if their fellow motorists get out [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=92.32s)]
*  and remove them from the road forcibly [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=94.04s)]
*  so they can go about their business [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=96.06s)]
*  because they have no right to be blocking public streets. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=97.32s)]
*  Now, Senator Fox's Vaughn, Hillary Vaughn, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=99.92s)]
*  pressed some progressive dams [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=101.88s)]
*  about these types of protests. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=103.84s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=106.28s)]
*  Anti-Israel protesters shut down bridges [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=107.56s)]
*  and blocked airports. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  Are you okay with that? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=110.8s)]
*  Are they anti-Israel or are they for Palestinian rights? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=111.64s)]
*  Anti-Israel protesters blocking the Brooklyn Bridge [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=114.16000000000001s)]
*  were burning the American flag [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=117.80000000000001s)]
*  and chanting, Death to America. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=119.04s)]
*  Do you support that type of protest? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=120.4s)]
*  Do you condemn this type of rhetoric? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=124.16000000000001s)]
*  Are you okay with people burning the American flag? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=129.72s)]
*  The fastest Katie Porter has ever moved. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=131.8s)]
*  Why are they also silent, Senator? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=134.68s)]
*  Well, Laura, they're silent because, as you said, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=139.36s)]
*  this isn't just left-wing protesters. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=141.84s)]
*  This is the entire machinery of the Democratic Party [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=144.24s)]
*  that protects these radical ideologues. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=146.68s)]
*  This is who they are, is it not? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=149.08s)]
*  As you said, Act Blue, which is, yeah. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  Now, this is the Democrat Party. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=152.04000000000002s)]
*  Act Blue, the Democratic fundraising machine, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=153.44s)]
*  is using, is raising money to pay for bail [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=155.24s)]
*  for these lunatics, just like Kamala Harris. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=158.6s)]
*  Raise money to pay for the bail for the BLM riders [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=161.36s)]
*  in the summer of 2020. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=164.84s)]
*  This is the Democratic Party machinery supporting [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=166.96s)]
*  these radical ideologues. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=170.16s)]
*  And of course, they are sympathetic to the causes [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=172.07999999999998s)]
*  that they're advocating as well. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=174.92s)]
*  So they're not really sympathetic to people [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=176.67999999999998s)]
*  who are trying to catch a flight at O'Hare [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=178.76s)]
*  to go visit a parent or see a kid's graduation [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=180.67999999999998s)]
*  or to a mom who's gotta get her kid [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=183.16s)]
*  to the doctor's office, to her school in the morning. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=185.07999999999998s)]
*  They're sympathetic to all of these anti-Israel [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=187.67999999999998s)]
*  pro-Hamas protesters, and therefore, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=189.95999999999998s)]
*  they don't wanna take a position [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=191.6s)]
*  on what they're doing to violate the law. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=193.27999999999997s)]
*  Well, Senator, what do you think? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=195.0s)]
*  What I'm saying is really nothing. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=195.83999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, what do you say, just really quickly, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=197.0s)]
*  if these people were protesting the open border [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=199.68s)]
*  and had shut down these major arteries going into airports, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=203.08s)]
*  don't you think Merrick Garland would be announcing [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=207.28s)]
*  massive RICO charges, huge task force, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=210.44s)]
*  they'd do another J-6 on this, would they not? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=213.8s)]
*  Yeah, it'd be SWAT teams coming in, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=217.16s)]
*  just like you saw at the Supreme Court today, Laura, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=219.32s)]
*  where the feds stretched the law to round up [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=221.28s)]
*  hundreds of January 6th defendants, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=223.96s)]
*  stretching it beyond its plain meaning [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=226.84s)]
*  to include two counts against Donald Trump. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=228.52s)]
*  That's what they do when it's conservatives [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=230.44s)]
*  undertaking such activities. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=232.84s)]
*  Unbelievable. Senator Cotton, thank you so much. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomQoh9pdLM&t=234.60000000000002s)]
