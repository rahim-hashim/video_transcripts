# Ben Shapiro: Qatar could end the Gaza war today #shorts #foxnews #worldnews #benshapiro #israel #us
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [July 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpsAeuRlaM)
*  If Qatar were to push Hamas to simply go into exile and give up the hostages, this war would [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpsAeuRlaM&t=0.0s)]
*  be over today. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpsAeuRlaM&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  And then the only question would be, as we say, what happens post-war, who governs? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpsAeuRlaM&t=5.92s)]
*  The big objection the Israelis have is that the Palestinian Authority has acted in concert [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpsAeuRlaM&t=9.76s)]
*  with Hamas a wide variety of the time, including, for example, pay for slave, paying the families [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpsAeuRlaM&t=13.38s)]
*  of terrorists, and all the rest. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpsAeuRlaM&t=18.6s)]
*  And so what Israel says is, why not have the Arab countries come in? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpsAeuRlaM&t=20.0s)]
*  The Arab countries, of course, want no peace of the Gaza Strip, because it's been a disaster [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpsAeuRlaM&t=23.0s)]
*  area for so long. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpsAeuRlaM&t=26.12s)]
*  And some alternative is going to have to be found to both the Palestinian Authority and [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpsAeuRlaM&t=27.64s)]
*  probably also to some of these Arab countries. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpsAeuRlaM&t=31.68s)]
