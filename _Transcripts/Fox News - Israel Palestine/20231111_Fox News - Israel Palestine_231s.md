# Israel is experiencing a national trauma: Dan Senor
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM)

*  Surprising Resilience of a [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=9.58s)]
*  Divided Nation in a Turbulent [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=11.74s)]

*  Good to be with you. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=15.88s)]
*  Welcome. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=16.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=16.78s)]
*  You know, congratulations on the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=17.38s)]
*  book. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=18.48s)]
*  I'm sure you never imagined that [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=18.76s)]
*  October 7th would happen when [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=20.42s)]
*  you wrote this book. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=22.16s)]
*  It talks about the incredible [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=24.02s)]
*  history and story of the Jewish [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=26.66s)]
*  people. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=28.560000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=29.1s)]
*  And their optimism as a people [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=29.26s)]
*  in the country. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=31.900000000000002s)]
*  I was just there with my family [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=32.46s)]
*  in June, and you feel it. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=33.9s)]
*  It's, you know, it's this [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=35.7s)]
*  amazing, resilient, happy [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=36.6s)]
*  culture. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=40.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=41.0s)]
*  How much has that been damaged [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=41.5s)]
*  by what has happened? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=43.38s)]
*  I think Israel is experiencing a [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=44.58s)]
*  national trauma, a personal and [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=46.6s)]
*  collective. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  Many Israelis are feeling the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=49.08s)]
*  personal trauma and the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=50.22s)]
*  collective trauma. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  And yet at the same time, it's [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=53.18000000000001s)]
*  paradoxical. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=54.38s)]
*  The country's completely coming [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=55.22s)]
*  together. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=56.36s)]
*  Keep in mind, Israel's ranked the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=57.22s)]
*  fourth happiest country in the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=58.56s)]
*  world. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=61.260000000000005s)]
*  Consistently it's been in the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=61.96s)]
*  top ten. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=63.02s)]
*  We quote this one journalist who [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=63.86s)]
*  wrote a piece a few years ago [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=65.32000000000001s)]
*  who visited Israel, who wasn't [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=66.66s)]
*  Jewish, had no connection to [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=68.06s)]
*  Israel, and just wrote a piece [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  saying, why are Israelis so damn [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=70.60000000000001s)]
*  happy? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=72.46000000000001s)]
*  There's violence, you know, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  they're in a dangerous [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=74.44s)]
*  neighborhood, they're under [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=75.18s)]
*  enormous stress, there's [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=75.9s)]
*  political polarization in the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=77.0s)]
*  country, and yet they're totally [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=78.04s)]
*  upbeat. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=79.18s)]
*  I think what you can't [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=79.94s)]
*  understate is the importance of [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=80.78s)]
*  the country's sense of [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=83.74000000000001s)]
*  belonging. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=84.78s)]
*  Everyone there feels a sense of [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=85.68s)]
*  belonging. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=86.74000000000001s)]
*  You feel that with the national [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=87.18s)]
*  military, with national service, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=88.2s)]
*  that almost every Israeli serves [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=89.58000000000001s)]
*  in their formative years, 18, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=91.38000000000001s)]
*  19, 20, 21 years old. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=92.68s)]
*  It not only gives them incredible [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=94.48s)]
*  skills in life, management, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=96.38000000000001s)]
*  leadership, but it also makes [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=97.88000000000001s)]
*  them feel a connection to the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=99.38000000000001s)]
*  state. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=100.42s)]
*  There's no fear of the deep state [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=101.38000000000001s)]
*  in Israel. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  There's no sense of the state as [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=103.42s)]
*  this other place. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=104.56s)]
*  They're all part of it. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=105.26s)]
*  They're all defending it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=106.02000000000001s)]
*  And it also gives them a [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=107.26s)]
*  camaraderie with one another. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=108.10000000000001s)]
*  So in the hull of a tank, which [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  we're seeing a lot of Israelis [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=111.36000000000001s)]
*  right now in the hulls of tanks, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  there are actually Israelis from [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=114.06s)]
*  all walks of life, very religious [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=115.4s)]
*  Jews, very secular Jews, Jews [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=116.86s)]
*  from Yemen and Iraq and Iran, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=118.54s)]
*  whose families go back [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=120.9s)]
*  generations, and Jews from the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=121.7s)]
*  United States and Europe. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=123.94s)]
*  And they're super secular, as I [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=125.44s)]
*  said, and some are sons of [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=127.08s)]
*  billionaires and others are [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=128.18s)]
*  sons of taxi drivers. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=129.14000000000001s)]
*  But this national experience [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=130.52s)]
*  that brings them together, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=132.34s)]
*  national service, gives them a [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=133.24s)]
*  sense of solidarity and I think [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=135.08s)]
*  gives them a connection to [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=136.78s)]
*  place. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=137.72s)]
*  And I do think ritual there [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=138.12s)]
*  matters. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=139.48000000000002s)]
*  Every Friday night there's a [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=140.02s)]
*  Shabbat. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=141.82s)]
*  Most Israelis shut them. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=142.82s)]
*  I'm sure you experienced it when [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=144.56s)]
*  you were there. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=145.32s)]
*  The things quiet down on [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=145.98s)]
*  Shabbat. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=146.98s)]
*  And so there's a sense of these [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=147.88s)]
*  personal experiences that you're [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=149.44s)]
*  sharing in with the entire [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=150.64s)]
*  country. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=151.83999999999997s)]
*  And that gives people a reason, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=152.32s)]
*  like a purpose to live. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=153.72s)]
*  So when you hear the leadership [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=155.01999999999998s)]
*  in Iran say, we're putting [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=157.07999999999998s)]
*  pressure on the North, we need [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=158.98s)]
*  to keep the squeeze on to [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  Israel right now because they [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=163.32s)]
*  want Israel to not exist. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=165.06s)]
*  Are you fearful? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=168.89999999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=170.16s)]
*  I mean, October 7th made me [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=171.0s)]
*  realize that you can't take [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=173.6s)]
*  Israel's security for granted. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=175.48000000000002s)]
*  I think that's what all [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=176.72s)]
*  Israelis have felt for some [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=177.52s)]
*  time. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=178.52s)]
*  And I think you're experiencing [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=179.32s)]
*  it on all fronts in Israel right [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=180.32s)]
*  now. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=181.8s)]
*  This thing can really expand [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=182.0s)]
*  into a multi-front war. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtztS6i4QmM&t=183.20000000000002s)]
