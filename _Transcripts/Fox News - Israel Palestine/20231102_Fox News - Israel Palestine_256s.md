# Doocy presses Kirby on ‘temporary pause’
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8)
*  Thanks, John. So talking about getting Americans out of Gaza, President Biden said, I want [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=0.0s)]
*  to thank our partners in the region and particularly Qatar. The leader of Hamas lives in Qatar. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=6.04s)]
*  So why is President Biden thanking them for anything? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=12.84s)]
*  Oh, geez, Peter. Let's take a step back here. Look at this. Qatar was... [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=15.56s)]
*  They are a terrorist group that killed Americans and kidnapped Americans within the last month. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=20.56s)]
*  Peter, Qatar has been helpful in getting those Americans out. I'm sure you would agree with [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=26.36s)]
*  me and everybody at your network would agree that getting American hostages out is a good [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=31.4s)]
*  thing. And Qatar was a key player in that regard. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=36.44s)]
*  Qatar has lines of communication with Hamas that almost nobody else has. Now, I'm not [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=39.94s)]
*  saying that we support Hamas. Of course we don't. They're a terrorist organization. And [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=45.04s)]
*  Israel has an absolute right to go after them. But Qatar has lines of communication that [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=50.16s)]
*  not everybody else has. And it would be irresponsible. In fact, I would expect that you and everybody [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=54.839999999999996s)]
*  else in here would be going after me if we weren't doing everything we could and having [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=60.4s)]
*  every possible conversation we can have to get Americans that are held hostage back home [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=67.6s)]
*  with their families. If we weren't doing that, it would be diplomatic malpractice. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=72.32s)]
*  Let me read something to you, if you don't mind. Just, I think I want to put this into [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=76.12s)]
*  some context here. Let me tell you what we're dealing with with Hamas. Oh, jeez, this is [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=81.28s)]
*  your notebook, Karim. Sorry. This fellow at Hamas, a guy named Ghazni Hamad, he did an [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=85.16s)]
*  interview a couple of days ago. He said, Israel is a country that has no place on our land. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=95.56s)]
*  We must remove it because it constitutes a security, military, and political catastrophe [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=101.17999999999999s)]
*  to the Arab and Islamic nation. It must be finished. We are not ashamed to say this with [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=105.6s)]
*  full force. We must teach Israel a lesson and we will do this again and again. That's [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=110.7s)]
*  what the Israeli people are up against. And that's the group that are holding innocent [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=115.72s)]
*  Americans as well as 200. And you're going to say, well, then why are you talking to [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=121.54s)]
*  them? And why are you? No, I'm not. No, I'm not. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=125.14s)]
*  Why aren't we asking them to hand over the leader of this terrorist group? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=128.54s)]
*  We are working with Qatar to get our people out and to help get aid in. That's a priority [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=131.82s)]
*  right now. And obviously, we're also helping Israel go after Hamas. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=138.18s)]
*  And as you push the Israelis for humanitarian pauses, are they just supposed to sit back [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=142.66s)]
*  and let Hamas attack them and attack them and attack them and not fight back? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=148.98000000000002s)]
*  We have been crystal clear that Israel has the right to defend themselves. I mean, my [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=156.62s)]
*  goodness. So a pause means they can still shoot back. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=161.18s)]
*  My goodness, Peter, we're giving them security assistance almost every day. But do we advocate [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=163.58s)]
*  pauses by both sides here, temporary localized to be able to get Americans out, to be able [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=169.66000000000003s)]
*  to get aid in? You betcha we do. That doesn't mean that we're calling for a general ceasefire. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=175.94s)]
*  There's a, hang on a second, there's a difference. There's a big difference here. And we understand [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=180.3s)]
*  that, as I said earlier, humanitarian pauses have to be negotiated and you have to have [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=186.26000000000002s)]
*  a credible basis for doing it in a temporary localized way. I would also expect that we [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=190.78s)]
*  would get a lot of criticism from you and from your network and others if we just eschewed [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=195.9s)]
*  the whole idea of some sort of temporary pause so that people couldn't get out. I mean, we're [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=201.7s)]
*  doing exactly what you should be doing to try to look after these folks. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=207.78s)]
*  So a pause does not help Hamas? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=210.98s)]
*  A temporary pause that's localized that would allow us to get aid in and to get our people [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=213.98s)]
*  out is a good thing for the people of Gaza. It's a good thing for the Americans that [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=219.94s)]
*  are being held hostage. And it's not going to stop Israel from defending itself because [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=225.02s)]
*  the security assistance we're providing continues to flow. And a temporary pause doesn't mean [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=230.14s)]
*  a general ceasefire where the war is over. It means pause only temporary for a specific [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=234.5s)]
*  purpose. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=239.7s)]
*  Hey everyone, I'm Emily Campagno. Catch me and my co-hosts, Harris Faulkner and Kaylee [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CqJh_Wc_8&t=240.7s)]
