# ‘Honest’ countries must defund the UN: Israel ambassador
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q)
*  The United Nations passing a resolution this week demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=0.0s)]
*  The U.S. voting against the measure, along with 13 other countries, standing with Israel. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=6.88s)]
*  Our next guest says this vote proves the U.N. body no longer holds even one ounce of legitimacy [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=12.86s)]
*  or relevance. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=19.02s)]
*  Israel's ambassador to the U.N., Galad Erdan, joins us now. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=21.02s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, thank you very much for being here. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=24.94s)]
*  So a vote like that doesn't surprise you. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=27.64s)]
*  What does it say about the U.N.? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=30.12s)]
*  You know what? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=31.76s)]
*  It did surprise me because I've been serving there for three years, but I never, never [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=32.760000000000005s)]
*  dreamt that after a massacre of 15, almost 1,500 babies and women and the elderly, the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=38.760000000000005s)]
*  U.N. cannot even unite in order to condemn a designated terrorist organization similar [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=48.16s)]
*  to ISIS or even to the Nazis. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=55.62s)]
*  It's something that is truly unfathomable. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=57.62s)]
*  How can they pass a resolution? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=60.18s)]
*  It's not without even condemning them, without even mentioning Hamas. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=63.019999999999996s)]
*  The resolution didn't even mention Hamas. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=67.7s)]
*  Didn't even mention as if this war started on its own, like automatically. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=69.34s)]
*  So I believe that the U.N. on Friday completely lost its legitimacy, its relevance. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=74.3s)]
*  I mean, the U.N. was founded in the wake of the Holocaust to prevent such atrocities from [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=81.5s)]
*  happening, and today the feeling is that not only it is not committed to preventing atrocities, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=86.5s)]
*  it is committed to ensuring they will happen again. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=92.33999999999999s)]
*  Why is there such an anti-Israel bias at the U.N.? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=96.17999999999999s)]
*  Why is it? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=101.14s)]
*  I mean, if only 13 countries are voting against it, that's huge. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=102.14s)]
*  Look, it's not only anti-Israeli bias. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=106.25999999999999s)]
*  It's, in a way, it's also anti-U.S. bias. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=109.7s)]
*  Many times you see that the U.N. cannot stop the war in Ukraine, cannot stop aggressions [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=114.14s)]
*  all across the globe. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=122.14s)]
*  One third of the U.N. are Muslim countries. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=124.74s)]
*  The structure of the U.N. is distorted. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=128.78s)]
*  A country with 20,000 people equals the United States of America in the General Assembly. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=133.46s)]
*  Iran, countries that are totally, the biggest human rights violators are part of the U.N. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=139.42000000000002s)]
*  Iran, the Human Rights Council. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=145.86s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=147.18s)]
*  So it's crazy. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=148.18s)]
*  And I think that today every honest country should defund the U.N. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=150.1s)]
*  Yeah, we should start defunding the U.N. until the bias stops, until the anti-Semitism stops. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=155.74s)]
*  We can no longer continue business as usual because now it's clearer than ever that, as [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=164.26000000000002s)]
*  I said, the U.N. cannot stop atrocities. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=169.46s)]
*  On the contrary, they try to ensure that it will happen again because they try to tie [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=172.94s)]
*  Israel hands from completely eradicating the terror capabilities of Hamas. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=178.36s)]
*  So if we cannot unite at the U.N. to fight against terrorists like ISIS, like Boko Haram, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=183.10000000000002s)]
*  like the Nazis, so what's the justification of having such a very expensive body that [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=191.82s)]
*  one third of it is being paid by U.S. taxpayers? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=201.22s)]
*  It's a great question. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=204.9s)]
*  We fund an organization that exists to hate us right here in Manhattan. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=205.9s)]
*  Yeah, and the pictures, the footage that we see here of people marching, chanting, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=210.82s)]
*  death to America, death to Israel, supporting the massacre of babies, the raping of women, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=218.42000000000002s)]
*  it's terrifying and it should be terrifying for every American watching us right now. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=225.9s)]
*  It's very, very telling. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=229.82000000000002s)]
*  There's also an information war going on right now, as you know, Fullwell, Ambassador. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=231.82000000000002s)]
*  Here's one CNN guest. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=235.78s)]
*  His name is Dr. Mads Gilbert. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=237.26000000000002s)]
*  Now saying that what the IDF is saying about the hospital and the command center is just [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=240.14000000000001s)]
*  not true. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=244.38s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=245.38s)]
*  I've been walking in all parts of Sheffa, in the basement, in the different clinics, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=246.54s)]
*  in the different buildings. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=252.57999999999998s)]
*  I've been there night and day, peacetime, wartime, all over. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=253.57999999999998s)]
*  I have never seen anything that could look like or function as some command center. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=259.46s)]
*  So he's a known Israeli critic. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=268.18s)]
*  What do you make of the denial that Hamas uses hospitals to shield their operations? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=270.64s)]
*  Sadly, there are many people who are quite naive within the Western world. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=274.98s)]
*  They think that if Hamas uses hospitals as command centers, they will show it to them [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=280.70000000000005s)]
*  and share the information with them. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=286.68s)]
*  We have the intelligence. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=289.12s)]
*  We hold all the proof. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=290.66s)]
*  Israel is a law-abiding democracy. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=292.90000000000003s)]
*  We share this intelligence with the U.S., with other Western countries. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=295.02000000000004s)]
*  When we say that we know 100 percent—by the way, we just publicized the interrogation [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=300.94s)]
*  of a few of the terrorists that participated in the massacre, and they themselves tell [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=306.41999999999996s)]
*  publicly that they know that the command centers are underneath hospitals, schools, mosques. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=313.21999999999997s)]
*  They embedded themselves only within an under-civilian infrastructure, because that's what they [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=320.5s)]
*  try to do, to recruit naive Western countries, to put pressure on Israel, to tie our hands, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=326.74s)]
*  making sure they won't be eliminated. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=334.98s)]
*  But this time, we are committed, because it's either us or them, and it must be us. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=337.66s)]
*  Exit question real quick. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=343.98s)]
*  How, so far, has the administration been in support for your effort? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=344.98s)]
*  We are grateful for the administration until now, and we think they're helping us in all [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=349.82s)]
*  of our needs, and we hope that it will continue exactly that way. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=355.06s)]
*  Hope so. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=360.38s)]
*  Israel's ambassador to the U.N., Gilad Erdogan, thank you so much, sir, for being here. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=361.38s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ5igvRzE4Q&t=365.62s)]
