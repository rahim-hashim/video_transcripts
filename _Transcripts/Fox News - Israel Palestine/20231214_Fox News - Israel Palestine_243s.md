# Israel tells Biden admin war will last more than several months
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo)
*  National security advisor Jake Sullivan says Israel's war with Hamas will not be over anytime soon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=0.0s)]
*  And he is heading to Israel today for quote, serious conversations with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Trey Yanks is live in southern Israel as close combat kicks into higher gear. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=11.76s)]
*  We might have seen a little bit of a preview of what Jake Sullivan is going to say when we heard what Biden said behind closed doors at a fundraiser last week. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=15.52s)]
*  And it seemed to show a little distance between him and Netanyahu. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=24.28s)]
*  Yeah, Dana, good morning. We are getting some new information in right now from a spokesperson for Israel's defense minister, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=30.64s)]
*  Yav Galant, who just met with national security advisor Jake Sullivan. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=37.08s)]
*  Galant told Sullivan, quote, It will last more than several months, but we will win and we will destroy them. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=41.36s)]
*  An indication this is going to be a long war for Israel and their operations on the ground in Gaza will go well into the new year. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=47.92s)]
*  It comes as fierce battles rage on in the northern and southern part of Gaza. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=55.76s)]
*  Another Israeli soldier was killed overnight, bringing the total to one hundred and sixteen since the ground operation began on a call with reporters. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=60.08s)]
*  An Israeli official declined to provide specific details when asked by Fox News for a timeline about securing territory in northern Gaza. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=68.76s)]
*  That official did, however, describe what efforts look like in southern Gaza around the city of Hanunis, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=76.4s)]
*  explaining that operations are taking place in pockets, not with the aim of holding large pieces of land. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=82.04s)]
*  And with the war expected to continue for months, U.S. officials continue to weigh in on the conflict. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=87.92s)]
*  National security advisor Jake Sullivan arrived in Israel today. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=93.44s)]
*  He's meeting with top officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu right now. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=96.84s)]
*  Still, though, sixty nine days into the war, Washington is not calling for a ceasefire. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=101.2s)]
*  While we all want the war to end as soon as possible to stop the human suffering and to establish conditions for an enduring peace, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=106.96s)]
*  something that the president and the entire team continues to pursue, a unilateral ceasefire with a terrorist group like Hamas is not the answer. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=112.63999999999999s)]
*  As the president has said, Hamas could release the hostages today. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=121.52s)]
*  Hamas continues to control vast parts of southern Gaza, though you can see here in this new video, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=127.36s)]
*  the amount of destruction in Gaza's second largest city of Hanunis. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=133.04s)]
*  Reports indicate around 20 percent of structures in Hanunis have been destroyed. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=136.76s)]
*  That number is expected to rise as the war continues. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=141.24s)]
*  It's not just the southern front that remains active. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=144.16s)]
*  More fire into northern Israel today from the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and the Israelis striking back. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=146.68s)]
*  Dana. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=152.68s)]
*  Right, Sheri Yings, thank you for that. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=153.48s)]
*  I think that's an interesting development here. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=156.0s)]
*  I mean, just about a week ago, the Israelis were saying they could wrap up the operation sometime in January. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=157.84s)]
*  Early January. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=162.16s)]
*  On the corner of that is going to go for months now. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=163.0s)]
*  The Hamas Politburo chief is a gentleman by the name of Ismail Haniya. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=166.04s)]
*  And he says this, any arrangement in Gaza in the Palestinian cause without Hamas or the resistance factions is a delusion. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=172.4s)]
*  So Ismail Haniya, with a quick Google search, will tell you that he lives in Qatar and two of the other Hamas leaders live in Qatar. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=180.64s)]
*  They've been taking in how much money for how many years? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=190.32s)]
*  Far from the action and the destruction and the war that's happening now in Gaza. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=193.68s)]
*  And they are protected by the Qataris there. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=198.72s)]
*  Also, Netanyahu said this, that I want to clarify my position. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=200.8s)]
*  I will not let Israel repeat the Oslo mistake. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=204.24s)]
*  Gaza will be neither Hamas or Fadistan. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=208.4s)]
*  So I think basically what they're saying is Israel saying we cannot live and survive if Hamas is a part of this situation. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=211.2s)]
*  What the Hamas people are saying, folks are saying is that we're not leaving. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=217.23999999999998s)]
*  So maybe that's why the Israelis are saying this war is going to take a little bit longer. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=220.79999999999998s)]
*  It could. And depending on what happens in the West Bank, whether it remains to have these little flash points that we hear about all the time, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=224.28s)]
*  or whether it gets greater than that is something that we're going to take into the new year. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=232.51999999999998s)]
*  Hopefully it doesn't go that way. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=235.92s)]
*  Meanwhile, the hostages are still being held on ground. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=238.04s)]
*  On and on and on. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1JC_C1OFJo&t=241.48s)]
