*  for Israel in the war [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=130.16s)]
*  moving forward? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=131.52s)]
*  Well, let's understand [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=134.04s)]
*  for one moment that [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=135.0s)]
*  Hezbollah is the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=136.12s)]
*  attack dog of Iran. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=136.84s)]
*  And one of the reasons [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=138.6s)]
*  that the moderate Arab [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=139.76s)]

*  Iran with such kid gloves [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=144.12s)]
*  is because of the fear [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=146.12s)]
*  of the havoc [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=147.12s)]

*  not only on Israel, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=149.2s)]

*  In a matter of 12 days, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=152.72s)]

*  This is like a football game [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=163.4s)]
*  where you're down [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=164.92000000000002s)]
*  a couple of scores, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=165.56s)]

*  What's the coach [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=168.23999999999998s)]

*  on a potential direct strike [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=176.88s)]
*  on Israel from Iran? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=179.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, on April 13th, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=182.6s)]
*  Iran issued a direct [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=184.44s)]

*  moderate Arab allies, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=189.88s)]
*  were able to defend [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=191.24s)]
*  against that attack. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=192.35999999999999s)]
*  Now is the moment [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=193.56s)]

*  of the United States [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=195.64s)]

*  last time. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=199.48s)]
*  There's not a second chance [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=200.04s)]
*  for this. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=201.32s)]
*  If you strike, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=201.72s)]
*  there will not be [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=203.04s)]
*  an Iranian nuclear program. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=203.95999999999998s)]
*  There will not be an Iranian [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=205.83999999999997s)]
*  oil producing port. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=207.67999999999998s)]
*  And if they're able [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=209.6s)]
*  to deliver that message, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  Iran will not strike. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=211.72s)]

*  right now. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=216.48s)]

*  Well, on that note, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=221.79999999999998s)]
*  there is, of course, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=223.11999999999998s)]
*  a presidential election [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=223.72s)]

*  around the globe [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=233.28s)]
*  if she wins in November [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=234.12s)]

*  in Gaza. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=244.76000000000002s)]
*  Harris might not keep all [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=245.72000000000003s)]
*  of Biden's foreign policy [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=246.88000000000002s)]
*  personnel in views [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=248.0s)]

*  but she's mostly signaling [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=250.56s)]
*  continuity, at least for now. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=252.52s)]
*  So what do you think about that? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=254.84s)]
*  It sounds like at best [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=256.32s)]
*  Kamala Harris would be similar [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=257.48s)]

*  overall. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=263.6s)]
*  At worst, she could, you know, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=264.52s)]
*  making be making those nods [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=266.32s)]
*  towards pro-Palestinian [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=268.16s)]

*  the current administration [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=270.92s)]
*  is right now. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=272.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, let's be very clear, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=274.48s)]
*  both of the hot wars going on, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=275.56s)]
*  both in Europe and the Middle [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=277.0s)]

*  hot wars. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=279.32s)]
*  It's his weakness [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=280.12s)]

*  Harris will make this [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=288.44s)]
*  substantially worse. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=289.44s)]
*  President Trump brought us peace [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=290.4s)]
*  throughout the Middle East, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=292.08s)]

*  it's unclear who Harris [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm6oyi9LClI&t=298.28s)]
