*  Entering Gaza City as soon as today while the IDF claims to have taken control of a Hamas outpost [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=29.56s)]
*  Within the strip meanwhile across the globe pro-palestinian protesters hitting the streets and major cities this weekend [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=35.72s)]
*  And we're at Torah Academy of Bergen County [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=47.36s)]
*  We'll be talking with folks on how it's impacting them here on the local level and in Jewish communities all across [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=50.08s)]
*  The country but first we check in with Trey Yanks. He's live on our southern in southern Israel with the latest. Hey Trey [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, hey guys good morning right now we know the Israelis are pushing deeper into the Gaza Strip [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=65.6s)]
*  They have Gaza City surrounded and I do want to just show you the level of destruction behind me near to the border [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=70.96s)]
*  The Israelis say they've hit [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=77.44s)]
*  450 different targets over the past 24 hours destroying Hamas command centers and different posts [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=79.67999999999999s)]
*  we do know that they are being ambushed and the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=86.16s)]
*  Air support and the artillery units along the border are trying to destroy any of the buildings where Hamas fighters are hiding in [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=89.96s)]
*  That's part of the reason you see so much destruction here [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=96.68s)]
*  I do want you also to take a look at this video that our cameraman Yanniv Turgiman filmed last night along the border [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=99.26s)]
*  We could see these massive explosions as the Israelis used bunker buster bombs to try and destroy the tunnel network beneath Gaza [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=105.56s)]
*  Now this comes as Fox News was granted access into the Gaza Strip this weekend [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=113.16s)]
*  We were with the Israeli military as they pushed deeper into the strip and got a firsthand look at the battles between Israel and Hamas [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=118.08s)]
*  Take a look [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=125.12s)]
*  You can hear that gunfire in the distance the Israelis are trying to engage [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=131.52s)]
*  Anyone who tries to ambush their forces and the battle is street by street. It is urban [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=135.8s)]
*  Guerrilla warfare as Hamas is popping out of tunnels and ambushing Israeli troops [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=141.78s)]
*  Right now we're embedded with the Israeli military inside the Gaza Strip [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=150.7s)]
*  These forces have been ambushed shot at and lost more than two dozen of their own soldiers [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=154.85999999999999s)]
*  Still they fight block by block in bloody urban battle their enemy Hamas [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=160.62s)]
*  Guerrilla fighters popping out of tunnels and trying to kill as many of the Israelis as they can [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=166.14s)]
*  You see the level of destruction there. There are more than a million Palestinian civilians internally displaced inside Gaza [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=171.38s)]
*  Many homes destroyed they'll have nowhere to return to and this does come as the Americans see what's happening on the ground here and [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=179.5s)]
*  Are trying to send a message to Hamas is regional allies including Iran not to get involved in this fight [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=186.74s)]
*  We do know in the Red Sea today [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=192.34s)]
*  There is the USS Florida a submarine that has a hundred and fifty four Tomahawk missiles on board again [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=193.74s)]
*  The Americans trying to signal to Israel's enemies across the region not to get involved guys back to you and Trey [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=199.9s)]
*  It was amazing video watching you actually in Gaza with the IDF [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=206.48s)]
*  You know since they're in there and they're not necessarily coming out, you know, they're staying they've got the Gaza City [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=211.86s)]
*  Surrounded at this point as you just pointed out. How are they resupplying? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=218.12s)]
*  the people on the front lines essentially with water and ammo and food and medicine and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=222.98s)]
*  equipment they might need [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=230.02s)]
*  It's a great question and they are taking convoys in and out of Gaza, but that journey is the most dangerous part [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=233.3s)]
*  We were in an APC with the Israeli military for 15 to 20 minutes just to get into Gaza more than a mile into the strip [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=239.94s)]
*  And when we got there it was far less tense actually inside until the gun battle started just because there were so many soldiers [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=246.62s)]
*  They have such a presence in these different areas [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=254.54s)]
*  But the soldiers are living on cans of tuna and canned corn, it's a very simple [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=256.54s)]
*  Life inside Gaza. They understand that they're not going to stay in these positions for a long time [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=262.5s)]
*  So they have really just what they can carry with them as they move from house to house and advance deeper into Gaza [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=267.1s)]
*  Yeah, Trey, this is an interesting juxtaposition today because you have Secretary of State Anthony Blinken [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=272.58000000000004s)]
*  He's just about to leave Turkey and over the weekend [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=278.1s)]
*  His whole message was that he is pushing the Biden administration is pushing for this [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=280.5s)]
*  Humanitarian pause and the thinking there is that it would be easier to negotiate for hostage releases if there's a brief pause in fighting [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=285.23999999999995s)]
*  but that's happening as [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=292.03999999999996s)]
*  fighting [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=294.4s)]
*  Around Gaza City is ramping up. So it does not seem like [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=295.64s)]
*  Israel and the United States is on the same page on this one. How are Israeli officials handling? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=299.59999999999997s)]
*  The push from the United States calling for these pauses [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=305.35999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, the Israelis and the Americans do not see eye to eye on this issue [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=310.08s)]
*  The Americans say there needs to be a pause in the fighting in order to increase the amount of humanitarian aid [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=313.68s)]
*  Well, the Israelis say they need a maximum pressure campaign against Hamas in order to get the hostages released [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=318.15999999999997s)]
*  I think we do have some of the video here of the Jordanian airdrop that took place overnight [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=324.15999999999997s)]
*  Jordan actually took one of their transport planes over the Gaza Strip and dropped aid into Gaza for Palestinian civilians [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=329.24s)]
*  Now it wasn't announced but this is something that certainly was coordinated with the Israelis [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=336.55999999999995s)]
*  Israel understands the amount of pressure they're facing from the United States and others to get aid into Gaza and so quietly behind the scenes [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=341.2s)]
*  They're allowing things like this to make sure that the Palestinian civilians in the strip have just a small amount of aid to get by [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=347.55999999999995s)]
*  But the World Food Program says the amount of aid getting into Gaza simply is not enough and the humanitarian crisis there will continue to deteriorate [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=353.64s)]
*  So Trey, I understand to have any rescue [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=360.84s)]
*  You need to get into Gaza City [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=364.40000000000003s)]
*  So is there a sense that the hostages become a priority as reports are that the IDF is in Gaza City? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=366.40000000000003s)]
*  Absolutely, it's a priority for the Israelis and as we were standing on that rooftop inside the Gaza Strip [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=378.40000000000003s)]
*  I spoke with Lieutenant Colonel Gilad Pasternak and I asked him about the situation [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=384.40000000000003s)]
*  And he gave me some new information and that information was that the Israelis believe the majority of the hostages are being held inside Gaza City beneath the city [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=388.56s)]
*  In the tunnel network beneath Gaza City and so this is different than what we originally thought [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=397.56s)]
*  There was an understanding maybe they were spread out throughout the strip and other population centers like Hanunis and Rafah [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=403.56s)]
*  The Israeli military says they think they are underneath Gaza City and it's part of the reason they have the city surrounded [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=408.56s)]
*  They've cut the Gaza Strip in half and they appear to be pushing it [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=413.72s)]
*  Lawrence? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=416.72s)]
*  You know Trey, I've been reading some reports of the mood on the ground from Gazans [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=418.72s)]
*  And I just wonder, you've been covering this conflict for years before we got to this war [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=424.72s)]
*  Have you noticed a tone change in the moderates in the Gaza Strip? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=429.72s)]
*  There's a huge frustration among Palestinian civilians in Gaza that I've been talking to about what happened [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=436.88000000000005s)]
*  Some of them were horrified by the massacre that took place in southern Israel on October 7th [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=441.88000000000005s)]
*  And they understand that what Hamas did set the Palestinian cause back decades [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=446.88000000000005s)]
*  Now oftentimes people look at the situation on the ground and they're not able to make the important distinction between the Palestinian people and the Palestinian people [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=451.88000000000005s)]
*  And so there is a frustration among moderate Palestinians about what took place [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=459.04s)]
*  And there's an understanding that as this unravels there are people in the United States for example that are taking to the streets and protesting against Israel [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=464.04s)]
*  Without having a firm understanding about Hamas and what the organization stands for [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=469.04s)]
*  Yeah they also have the Hamas flags up there too which is absolutely insane [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=474.04s)]
*  That's right [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=479.04s)]
*  And so there's a frustration among moderate Palestinians about what took place [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=481.04s)]
*  And so there is a frustration among moderate Palestinians about what took place [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=486.20000000000005s)]
*  And so there is a frustration among moderate Palestinians about what took place [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLZhY3g60kY&t=489.20000000000005s)]
