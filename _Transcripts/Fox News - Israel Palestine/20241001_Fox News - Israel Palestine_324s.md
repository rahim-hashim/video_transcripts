# Bill Hemmer: This could be a game-changer for Israel
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc)
*  I want to go overseas right now because there is a new phase [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=0.0s)]
*  that's developing, the fight against terror. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=3.94s)]
*  Israel launching what it describes as a limited and [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=5.84s)]
*  targeted ground raid in southern Lebanon. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=8.88s)]
*  It's aimed at Hezbollah, the Iranian proxy, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=11.78s)]
*  well dug in there. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=14.52s)]
*  Adam Boller, lead negotiator for the Abraham Accords with me now [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=16.22s)]
*  and Adam, good morning to you. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=19.38s)]
*  So apparently I'm similar to Gaza. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=21.02s)]
*  Hezbollah has tunnels as well in southern Lebanon. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=25.22s)]
*  Do we know or understand the extent of those tunnels? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=28.14s)]
*  They're much simpler. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=32.9s)]
*  So the Gaza tunnels are very intertwined because it's such a [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=34.300000000000004s)]
*  small amount of space. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=36.800000000000004s)]
*  Hezbollah has tunnels but they're much less of a tunneling [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=38.300000000000004s)]
*  organization because they have a lot more land and they own [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=41.74s)]
*  them. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=44.08s)]
*  So you're not going to see the extensive network in Lebanon [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=45.32s)]
*  that you will see in Hamas. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=48.32s)]
*  Yeah, I saw this front and personal in 2006. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=49.92s)]
*  The Israeli version of their Marines, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=54.58s)]
*  the units, they're in concrete bunkers during the day and then [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=56.940000000000005s)]
*  they can cross the border at nighttime. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  I carry out missions that even come back in the evening. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=64.18s)]
*  I assume that's, in the following morning I should say [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=66.38s)]
*  at dawn, I assume that's part of the operation now, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=69.26s)]
*  would you agree? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=72.46000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, those are their guerrilla raid teams and you're going to [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=74.4s)]
*  see them go out in front. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=77.0s)]
*  One, they're going to kind of scout before any regular [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=79.04s)]
*  military goes. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=81.2s)]
*  They're going to destroy kind of a search and destroy type [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=83.08s)]
*  mission to eliminate infrastructure because the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=85.66s)]
*  primary Israeli goal here is to make it so people can move back [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=87.72s)]
*  to the north. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=92.0s)]
*  As everybody knows, Hezbollah since the start of October 7th [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=93.6s)]
*  has been bombing Israeli towns. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=96.66s)]
*  There's been a tit for tat but it keeps happening and so Israel [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=99.74s)]
*  is going to take this opportunity now that they [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=102.8s)]
*  weakened Hezbollah to go and take the southern part of [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=104.94s)]
*  Lebanon and secure it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=107.67999999999999s)]
*  Adam, this is 18 years removed. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=110.47999999999999s)]
*  In 2006 the Israelis did not have a lot of success in that [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=112.96s)]
*  operation in southern Lebanon. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=115.5s)]
*  How long would it take to be successful this time? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=117.39999999999999s)]
*  What's your guess? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=120.69999999999999s)]
*  Well, I think there's really two main differences here. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=122.24s)]
*  The first is the stunning strikes and activity that we [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=124.97999999999999s)]
*  saw last week. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=128.22s)]
*  The amount that Israel has prepared for this, both hitting [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=129.92s)]
*  folks at low levels with their pagers, with their walkie-talkies [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=132.98s)]
*  and then finally killing Nisrallah, which is the most [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=137.01999999999998s)]
*  important person they could have assassinated in the region, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  perhaps except the supreme leader of Iran. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=144.42s)]
*  But I think all of this has blown everybody away and maybe [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=147.42s)]
*  I shouldn't use that term because that's a little literal. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=151.7s)]
*  But it's a very different situation at Hezbollah which is [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=154.4s)]
*  clearly reeling and I think Israel is very smart. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=157.79999999999998s)]
*  When you have your enemy reeling, you press forward. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=161.84s)]
*  I think Israel will play using guerrilla operations, using [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=165.48s)]
*  their front war to secure that and then eventually back away. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=169.86s)]
*  They don't want to be in Lebanon and what they really should do [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=173.74s)]
*  and I hope that the Lebanese government can meet here too [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=176.84s)]
*  because they're doing a favor for the Lebanese government too [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=179.88s)]
*  in eliminating Hezbollah. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=182.78s)]
*  Two specific questions on that. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=183.94s)]
*  We don't know how quickly Hezbollah can bring in [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=186.44s)]
*  reinforcements for their leadership. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=189.72s)]
*  I mean, we don't have an understanding for that just yet. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  How much of a setback this might be, Adam? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=195.52s)]
*  Well, I would say you've got thousands of fighters that are [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=199.62s)]
*  incapacitated. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=203.22s)]
*  Obviously, it's hard to fight without an arm or with your [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=204.92s)]
*  testicles blown off. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=207.82s)]
*  The key here too is we have not just eliminated Nasrallah, but [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=209.95999999999998s)]
*  if you look at the military leadership of the entire terrorist [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=214.16s)]
*  organization, you'll see Xs all down the board. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=219.04s)]
*  That means we eliminated a generation of military [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=222.64s)]
*  leadership and that is a very, very significant event. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=225.44s)]
*  And that is very hard to come back from. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=229.44s)]
*  So it will take Hezbollah a while. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=231.73999999999998s)]
*  It won't be days. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=233.83999999999997s)]
*  And so it creates a very significant opportunity. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=235.14s)]
*  I'll make one other point because I think it's important [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=238.23999999999998s)]
*  here. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=240.73999999999998s)]
*  Because Hezbollah is in disarray, because we did this, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=241.88s)]
*  it changes the region dynamics. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=245.01999999999998s)]
*  And what I mean by that is it changes our opportunity to make [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=247.22s)]
*  a difference in Iran because the reason we didn't act before [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=251.61999999999998s)]
*  on Iran's nuclear facilities was fear of Hezbollah attacking [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=255.16s)]
*  Israel. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=258.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, that was my question. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=259.94s)]
*  You neutralize Hamas, maybe neutralize Hezbollah. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=261.34000000000003s)]
*  You keep the Houthis at bay in Yemen, and now the Israelis [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=266.02000000000004s)]
*  would have an opportunity to go after Iran. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=269.32s)]
*  That would be a game changer if that day were to happen and if [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=271.86s)]
*  that raid were to be successful. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=275.26s)]
*  Adam, do you see that as a possibility? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=277.76s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=280.7s)]
*  I think the Israelis have three main goals right now. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=282.04s)]
*  They want to clear out southern Lebanon. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=284.34000000000003s)]
*  They want to get as many hostages back as possible and [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=286.88s)]
*  kill the Hamas leader that's there, Sinwar, kill him. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=290.41999999999996s)]
*  And then they want and should want to take out as much as [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=294.67999999999995s)]
*  they can on the nuclear facilities of Iran. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=298.21999999999997s)]
*  And if they get the Supreme Leader, too, all the better. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=301.59999999999997s)]
*  If that's the case, if that ever comes to pass someday, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=304.15999999999997s)]
*  the Abraham Accords would go on steroids. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=307.35999999999996s)]
*  Thank you for your time, Adam. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=310.64s)]
*  We'll speak down the road, okay? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vznFL7oGHQc&t=311.79999999999995s)]
