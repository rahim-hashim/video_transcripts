# Kamala Harris refuses to call Israel a 'close ally' one year after Oct. 7
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo)
*  Today marks one year since Hamas's October 7th terror attack on Israel, the deadliest [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=0.0s)]
*  attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=7.36s)]
*  On this day, we remember the innocent lives that were lost to Hamas's senseless act of [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=10.72s)]
*  violence, the families that were torn apart, and the attendees of the Nova Music Festival [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=15.84s)]
*  who had their futures robbed from them. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=20.88s)]
*  We also remember the 101 hostages who remain in Hamas captivity. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=23.84s)]
*  This is Outnumbered, I'm Kaylee McEnany. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=28.68s)]
*  Joining me today, Fox & Friends co-host Ainsley Earhart, anchor and executive editor of The [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=30.56s)]
*  Story Martha McCallum, Fox News contributor and the Federalist Editor-in-Chief Molly Hemingway, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=35.04s)]
*  and Fox News contributor and host of the Guy Benson show on Fox News Radio, Guy Benson. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=40.88s)]
*  But first, let's go to Trey Yngst. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  He's live on the ground in southern Israel with the latest. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=47.92s)]
*  Trey. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=50.44s)]
*  Yeah, Kaylee, good afternoon. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=51.44s)]
*  Today does mark one year since that horrific cross-border attack by Hamas coming from Gaza [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=54.08s)]
*  into southern Israel and slaughtering so many people. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=59.62s)]
*  Here's a look at the humans affected by this war. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=63.16s)]
*  Rimon Butch Dab sobs while she reaches for her husband, Yegev. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=68.16s)]
*  As dirt covers his casket, the grief is too much to bear. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=73.0s)]
*  Yegev's mother and sister look on. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=77.2s)]
*  Their faces are filled with agony and deep sadness. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=79.2s)]
*  After waiting nearly 11 months for Yegev to be released from Hamas' captivity, this family, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=82.84s)]
*  like so many others, must now come to terms with a painful reality. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=88.48s)]
*  What happened on October 7th turned our world upside down. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=93.60000000000001s)]
*  It's incomprehensible. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=97.36s)]
*  A year after the October 7th attack against Israel, 101 hostages remain inside Gaza. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=98.36s)]
*  More than half of them, according to a senior Israeli official, are still alive. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=105.44s)]
*  On that dark day, Hamas launched a cross-border assault on Israel, killing around 1,200 people, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=111.36s)]
*  sparking a war that continues today. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  The Israeli campaign against Hamas targeted much of the group's military infrastructure, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=120.96s)]
*  including an elaborate network of tunnels used to move militants and hold captives. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=127.36s)]
*  You can see Israeli forces here remain on high alert. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=132.32s)]
*  They have their weapons raised, understanding that Hamas fighters could be just around the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  corner. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=139.52s)]
*  With the war ongoing, civilians continue to pay the highest price. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=143.68s)]
*  So far, tens of thousands of Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli air and ground [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=150.20000000000002s)]
*  campaign, with nearly two million displaced. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=155.04000000000002s)]
*  For many, their wounds will remain a haunting reminder of the conflict. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  This cannot describe how I feel now. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=164.6s)]
*  And even if I described it, you would never feel what I feel because suffering is beyond [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=167.44s)]
*  what you can imagine. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  A year later, the war rages on in the distance. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=178.95999999999998s)]
*  We've heard Israeli artillery today attack helicopters overhead, and Hamas firing rockets [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  into southern and central Israel. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=186.88s)]
*  Kayleigh? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=189.04s)]
*  And Trey, you have a book coming out about October 7th called Black Saturday. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=190.04s)]
*  Tell us about it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=193.92s)]
*  Black Saturday is a firsthand account of the October 7th massacre and the days that followed. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=196.92s)]
*  And you hear not just from our team, but you hear from the people who lived this experience, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=202.56s)]
*  from the hostages who were dragged into Gaza, to Israeli soldiers and civilians, to Palestinians, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  Hamas leadership and Israeli leadership. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=213.0s)]
*  The goal here is to give the reader a clear picture of what happened on that horrific [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=214.98s)]
*  day and in the weeks that followed. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=219.39999999999998s)]
*  And as we know, as we are speaking, the war continues and there's no end in sight in [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=221.66s)]
*  terms of a diplomatic solution to end this conflict. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=226.68s)]
*  Kayleigh? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=229.74s)]
*  An important piece of history. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=230.74s)]
*  Thank you very much, Trey. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=231.82s)]
*  One year later, Israel is still fighting for its right to exist and fighting to recover [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=234.57999999999998s)]
*  the hostages still held by Hamas at this hour. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=238.8s)]
*  Several of those hostages are indeed American citizens. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=242.98s)]
*  However, Vice President Kamala Harris is refusing to call Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=245.82s)]
*  an ally. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=251.78s)]
*  Do we have a real close ally in Prime Minister Netanyahu? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=254.34s)]
*  I think with all due respect, the better question is do we have an important alliance between [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=262.46s)]
*  the American people and the Israeli people? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=269.6s)]
*  And the answer to that question is yes. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=271.94s)]
*  Netanyahu, of course, represents the people of Israel. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=274.7s)]
*  Martha, you know, the support for Israel has been fervent in word from the Biden administration, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=278.70000000000005s)]
*  but perhaps tepid in action. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=284.06s)]
*  We saw the jostling last week, the call for a ceasefire after Israel had that slight incursion [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=285.54s)]
*  into southern Lebanon. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=290.78000000000003s)]
*  And then all of a sudden we support Israel, oh wait, but not attacking Iran's nuclear [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=292.46000000000004s)]
*  sites. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=296.06s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I'm struck by the title of Trey's book. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=297.06s)]
*  I think that Black Saturday is a feeling that comes back for all of us today as we remember [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=300.98s)]
*  how horrific this attack was, how it came out of nowhere and how it came after decades [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=307.21999999999997s)]
*  of peace. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=312.5s)]
*  Essentially, there had been, you know, skirmishes over those borders from time to time. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=313.9s)]
*  But in general, Israel was a very prosperous democratic nation that respects the freedom [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=319.02s)]
*  and individuality of all people in Israel, which is not something that is felt around [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=324.78s)]
*  the Middle East. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=330.14s)]
*  It's something that we should be able to support and voice as an alliance with no reservation [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=331.14s)]
*  whatsoever. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=335.82s)]
*  I just can't help but remember watching that October 7th video over here at the Israeli [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=336.82s)]
*  consulate and a little boy who watched his father murdered in their home. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=341.9s)]
*  And then he had to sit in a chair and watch a Hamas terrorist drink juice from his refrigerator. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=347.94s)]
*  And he screamed, why am I alive? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=354.3s)]
*  And I will never forget that little boy's cry, as long as I live. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=357.32s)]
*  I think that, you know, when you watch the behavior of Hezbollah and Hamas, what I don't [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=362.3s)]
*  understand is why she doesn't use that opportunity to talk about them and how easy it is and [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=367.66s)]
*  how clear it is to be in alliance clearly with the leadership in Israel and with the [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=373.72s)]
*  Israeli people when you look at what they have been facing. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=379.22s)]
*  No doubt that's so well said. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=382.62s)]
*  You know, Ainsley, the image I can't get out of my mind is the image of Kefir Bevis. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=384.22s)]
*  He's the youngest hostage. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=388.82000000000005s)]
*  We'll put up his picture with his brother, Ariel Bevis. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=389.82s)]
*  His mom is Shiri, his dad is Yarden. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=392.26s)]
*  They are still in captivity somewhere out there. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=394.54s)]
*  Kefir celebrated his first birthday in captivity. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=397.86s)]
*  His brother, Ariel, his fifth birthday in captivity. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=401.46s)]
*  He was just nine months when he was abducted. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=404.3s)]
*  Every night I get on my knees with my daughter. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=406.5s)]
*  We pray for Kefir, Ariel, Shiri, Yarden. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=408.65999999999997s)]
*  Maybe we'll have a miracle one day. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=411.82s)]
*  Do you really? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=413.02s)]
*  That is so sweet. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=414.02s)]
*  And I remember the lady, we were talking about her in our Bible study. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=415.02s)]
*  And I remember we all broke down in tears. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=418.58s)]
*  We were talking about that lady. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=420.5s)]
*  We kept seeing the images of blood on her bottom. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=422.02s)]
*  And I just thought she sat in blood. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=425.3s)]
*  I didn't think the worst could have happened. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=427.21999999999997s)]
*  And then someone, I watched a video of talking about the assault that she probably went through, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=429.5s)]
*  the brutal assault. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=433.78s)]
*  Didn't even think about that as a woman. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=434.78s)]
*  So we saw these images. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=437.24s)]
*  We at Fox had the opportunity to watch the GoPro cam that the soldiers were, that Hamas [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=438.53999999999996s)]
*  was using and some of the Israeli soldiers were using when they went back through to [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=443.52s)]
*  see what was left. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=447.48s)]
*  And I mean, there wasn't a dry eye in that room at Fox, in that banquet room that we [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=449.46000000000004s)]
*  watched. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=453.36s)]
*  So never forget these photos. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=454.36s)]
*  And I'm just shocked at the Biden administration. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=455.56s)]
*  Why can't Kamala Harris, why can't she acknowledge that Benjamin Netanyahu is an ally? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=457.84000000000003s)]
*  This is one of our biggest allies, if not our biggest ally. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=462.54s)]
*  The Bible is clear about where Israel stands, the promised land. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=465.52000000000004s)]
*  Those are the chosen people. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=469.62s)]
*  So I just feel like you've got Hamas still in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=470.78000000000003s)]
*  You have the Houthis in Yemen and she can't even say that they're an ally. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=474.84s)]
*  I think this administration needs to give 100 percent support to Israel like Donald [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=479.17999999999995s)]
*  Trump does. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=483.4s)]
*  Yes, and Guy, I want to play this clip from General Higary. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=484.4s)]
*  He's the spokesperson for IDF. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=486.44s)]
*  I think it's important viewers understand October 7th is not just something that happened. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=487.79999999999995s)]
*  It's static. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=491.7s)]
*  It's in the past. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=492.7s)]
*  Move on to ceasefire. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=493.7s)]
*  There's another October 7th that was in the planning. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=494.7s)]
*  This was announced just last week. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=496.58s)]
*  Hezbollah has openly declared that it plans to carry out its own October 7th massacre [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=499.44000000000005s)]
*  on Israel's northern border, but on an even larger scale. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=505.48s)]
*  They call this plan Conquer the Galilee. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=510.66s)]
*  For years, Hezbollah has been planning to do in northern Israel what Hamas did in southern [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=514.6600000000001s)]
*  Israel on October 7th, invade Israel, infiltrate civilian communities and massacre innocent [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=520.1600000000001s)]
*  civilians. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=527.8s)]
*  Hezbollah wanted to do it again. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=528.8s)]
*  That will be harder for them because their entire leadership has been decapitated by [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=531.2s)]
*  the Israelis in the last few weeks. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=535.04s)]
*  I'm struck by that report that we watched from Trey Yankst and you saw the suffering [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=537.28s)]
*  on both sides of this conflict. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=541.6s)]
*  And it's important of course to drive home. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=543.4s)]
*  The conflict was started by Israel's enemies. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=545.08s)]
*  Israel did not want this. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=548.6s)]
*  They did not ask for it. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=549.6s)]
*  They are responding as they must. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=551.04s)]
*  And when you look at the civilian casualties that are happening in Gaza, that is despite [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=553.4s)]
*  Israel's best efforts, Hamas embeds themselves within civilians, whereas Hamas and Hezbollah [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=557.68s)]
*  deliberately target civilians on the Israeli side. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=563.8399999999999s)]
*  There is no moral equivalence. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=567.04s)]
*  And for people who want the war to be over, it could have been over at the very beginning [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=569.76s)]
*  by not launching the attacks on Israel. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=574.1999999999999s)]
*  It could have been over with a disarmament by either of these terrorist groups. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=576.56s)]
*  It could have been over if they had brought the hostages back home. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=580.68s)]
*  They refused to do so. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=583.8399999999999s)]
*  So Israel is doing what it must. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=585.3599999999999s)]
*  And to your point, just as Hamas was doing, Hezbollah had their tunnels underneath children's [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=587.1s)]
*  beds, again discovered last week. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=592.88s)]
*  And I think this shows that US elections don't just have great consequences for our country. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=595.94s)]
*  They can have great consequences globally. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=600.62s)]
*  You had in the Trump administration, peace breaking out in the Middle East. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=603.02s)]
*  You had Iran isolated with pivoting towards Saudi Arabia and letting them be the big dog [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=606.84s)]
*  in the region. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=611.5s)]
*  And the Biden-Harris administration comes in. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=612.74s)]
*  They actively work to return power to Iran. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=614.98s)]
*  And Iran, of course, funds Hezbollah and Hamas. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=618.1s)]
*  That's where this conflict comes from. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=620.6600000000001s)]
*  It's really just a proxy war between from Iran toward Israel. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=621.94s)]
*  And it shows you that these foreign policy things matter a great deal and can cause problems [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=626.2800000000001s)]
*  globally. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=632.1s)]
*  Without a doubt. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=633.1s)]
*  All right. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=634.1s)]
*  Well, we hold those families in our prayers and the 101 hostages still out there. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=635.1s)]
*  We pray for you. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU35yTLIpo&t=638.5s)]
