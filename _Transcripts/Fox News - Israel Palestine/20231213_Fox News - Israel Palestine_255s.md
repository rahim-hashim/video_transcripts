# UN General Assembly to demand cease-fire in Israel-Hamas war
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk)
*  Any ceasefire right now would be temporary at the best and dangerous at worst. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=0.0s)]
*  Dangerous to Israelis who would be subject to relentless attacks and also dangerous to [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=7.4s)]
*  Palestinians who deserve the chance to build a better future for themselves free from Hamas. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=13.44s)]
*  A lonely but strong voice in opposition at the United Nations General Assembly, the world [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=21.16s)]
*  body overwhelmingly passing a resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza but makes no mention [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=25.26s)]
*  of Hamas or their terror attacks on October 7th. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=30.46s)]
*  Joining us now is former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, he's a Fox News contributor. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=33.86s)]
*  The ambassador, this is call for number one if you could play this for Mr. Secretary because [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=37.660000000000004s)]
*  I want you to listen to what he is saying if the UN really wants a ceasefire, he's got [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=42.58s)]
*  a suggestion. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=46.86s)]
*  If you want a real ceasefire, here is the right address. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=49.02s)]
*  This is the phone number of Hamas' office in Gaza. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=54.94s)]
*  You can all call. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=59.32s)]
*  I don't know if anyone is actually going to call but if they did they would probably find [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=62.14s)]
*  out that Hamas has no plans of stopping. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=66.53999999999999s)]
*  Well Dana Bill good morning. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=71.62s)]
*  No Hamas has no plans of stopping until they are thoroughly eliminated, its leadership, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=72.62s)]
*  its infrastructure, each of the things must go. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=76.78s)]
*  No doubt about it the Israelis have this right. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  It wasn't surprising what happened to the United Nations yesterday. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=82.82s)]
*  They have been on the wrong side of the issues around Israel for an awfully long time. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=86.02s)]
*  We've all seen it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=88.97999999999999s)]
*  It's the UN's utility is very, very limited. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=89.97999999999999s)]
*  We saw what Secretary General Gutierrez said as well at the outset. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=93.86s)]
*  Frankly, he sounded like he was auditioning to be the president of Harvard University. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=96.53999999999999s)]
*  Just didn't fundamentally understand the barbaric nature of what took place on October [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=101.02s)]
*  7th and the threat to the Jews all across the world. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=105.13999999999999s)]
*  I hope that the Israelis will continue to stand strong. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=108.33999999999999s)]
*  I've listened to President Biden. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=112.26s)]
*  His ambassador did a good job yesterday but he's talking about Israeli indiscriminate [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=113.94s)]
*  bombing. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=118.1s)]
*  That's just wrong. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=119.1s)]
*  Nothing about what they've done has been indiscriminate. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=120.1s)]
*  He's talking about how hard it is for our government to work with Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=122.06s)]
*  That is music to the ears of the leadership of Hamas and the Ayatollah in Iran. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=126.74s)]
*  We can't only stand strong with Israel at the United Nations. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=131.62s)]
*  We have to do so in our dealings with them as well. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=133.98s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu says this after Hamas is eliminated in Gaza, if and when that happens. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=136.74s)]
*  I want to clarify my position. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=142.06s)]
*  I will not let Israel repeat the Oslo mistake that's going back to the 1990s. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=143.98000000000002s)]
*  Gaza will be neither Hamas-stan or Fatah-stan. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=149.06s)]
*  Just go back to this resolution at the UN here. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=153.74s)]
*  It was introduced by Egypt. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=156.14000000000001s)]
*  Egypt, okay. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=158.14000000000001s)]
*  Voting with the United States, Israel, Czech Republic. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=159.86s)]
*  She's been amazing by the way. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=162.78s)]
*  The woman from Prague. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=164.46s)]
*  Austria. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=166.01999999999998s)]
*  And then we had Guatemala, Nauru in the South Pacific. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=167.01999999999998s)]
*  Micronesia, Papua New Guinea, and Paraguay. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=171.54s)]
*  So they're with us and they're with Israel. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=175.22s)]
*  But think about the Egyptians for a moment. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=177.42s)]
*  Weren't they the ones who cemented the Rafa Gate in the early days of the Israeli invasion [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=179.42s)]
*  of Gaza? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=186.06s)]
*  Weren't they the government that said no Palestinians can leave Gaza and come into the Sinai? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=187.98s)]
*  Do we have that right? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=194.45999999999998s)]
*  They cemented the gate? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=195.84s)]
*  Yes, Bill. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=197.44s)]
*  You have these facts right. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=199.96s)]
*  The Egyptians have steadfastly refused to take any of the refugees that want to get [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=201.32s)]
*  out of the way of the fighting that's taking place as a result of Hamas' attack in Israel. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=205.88s)]
*  It's worth noting too, Bill, you talked earlier about the attacks on an American vessel in [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=211.68s)]
*  the Red Sea. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=215.76s)]
*  Pull a map out. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=216.76s)]
*  That's Egypt, right? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=218.32s)]
*  The risk from the Houthi rebels, the risk from the Iranians is just as real for the Gulf [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=220.24s)]
*  Arab states, for Israel as it is for the rest of the world. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=224.04s)]
*  This has to be taken on deterrence against Iran, has to be reestablished if we're going [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=228.12s)]
*  to get this right. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=232.04s)]
*  And the Egyptians, I hope, will come to see that. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=233.04s)]
*  Even if they can't do so publicly, I hope they will come to see that Israel's elimination [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=235.23999999999998s)]
*  of Hamas in Gaza is greatly to their benefit. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=239.28s)]
*  It reduces risk to their own people. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=242.04s)]
*  It reduces risk throughout the entire region. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=243.79999999999998s)]
*  And the Israelis have started flooding those tunnels with seawater. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=246.56s)]
*  Secretary of State, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, great to have you here. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=250.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIisU9NiEbk&t=253.96s)]
