# Expert calls on Biden admin to ramp up condemnation of Iran
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [September 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo)
*  Let's bring in Brent Sadler. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=0.0s)]
*  He's retired Navy captain and former Pentagon official. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=1.52s)]
*  Thank you, sir, for joining us on this Labor Day. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=4.2s)]
*  Greatly appreciate your insights. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  I want to start with the murder, the execution [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=8.32s)]
*  of this American hostage, Hirsch Goldberg-Polen, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  who spent 332 days in captivity. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=13.68s)]
*  And the execution happening while Americans are working, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=17.16s)]
*  actively working toward his release, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=20.92s)]
*  towards the release of all the hostages [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  and this ceasefire deal. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=24.88s)]
*  What do you make of the boldness of that action [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=26.8s)]
*  on the part of Hamas, and what should the response [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=29.4s)]
*  from the United States be? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=31.279999999999998s)]
*  Well, I'll start first with the US response. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=34.48s)]
*  I mean, this was an act of terror on the behalf of Hamas. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=37.08s)]
*  And so there needs to be a lot more condemnation [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=42.32s)]
*  and pressure applied to Iran, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=45.4s)]
*  who pulls the strings and also supplies Hamas, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=47.4s)]
*  but then also a lot more direct pressure [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=50.16s)]
*  on Hamas from the US. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=52.44s)]
*  I mean, it's telling that the first comments [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=53.84s)]
*  or that Netanyahu needs to do more. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=56.36s)]
*  When they are the agreed party in this case. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=58.78s)]
*  But as far as ongoing military operations, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=60.900000000000006s)]
*  efforts to release the hostages, these are extremely risky. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=64.34s)]
*  And again, that comes with the risk [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=68.42s)]
*  of what we saw just unfold this weekend, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=70.62s)]
*  where Hamas gets a tip off or has enough time [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=72.94s)]
*  to unfortunately harm its hostages. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=76.1s)]
*  Yeah, and unfortunately the murder [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=79.66s)]
*  of these six hostages in particular has galvanized [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=81.98s)]
*  and sent people to the streets once again [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=85.5s)]
*  in Israel, Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, all across the country. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=87.42s)]
*  And his mother, Rachel Goldberg-Powen spoke today, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=90.38s)]
*  it was raw, it was heart wrenching. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=94.38s)]
*  But among the things that she said to her son, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=95.82000000000001s)]
*  who has of course now been murdered, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=98.42s)]
*  I pray that your death will be a turning point [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=99.7s)]
*  in this horrible situation that we're in. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=102.36s)]
*  Could this, the execution of these six individuals [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=105.3s)]
*  somehow be a turning point? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=108.84s)]
*  Well, when I see the protest in Israel [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=112.24000000000001s)]
*  from friends that are in country and in the region, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=114.62s)]
*  there's several things that are behind it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=117.42s)]
*  There is a longstanding animosity to Netanyahu [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=119.5s)]
*  and his right-wing government, which predates October 7th. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=122.7s)]
*  There's frustration with all parties in Israel [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=126.62s)]
*  with the incompetence that the IDF was unable to prevent [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=130.26s)]
*  and safeguard Israelis on October 7th. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=134.38s)]
*  And so that also is an issue. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=136.98000000000002s)]
*  And then the final is despite months of military operations, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=139.16s)]
*  the IDF has not been able to destroy Hamas [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=143.54s)]
*  nor get rescue more of the hostages safely. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=146.7s)]
*  So all of this is coming together [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=150.88s)]
*  on top of the desire for those with loved ones [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=152.89999999999998s)]
*  that are being held by the terrorist Hamas [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=155.82s)]
*  to get them back safely. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=158.04s)]
*  But at the end of the day, there has to be a world [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=159.7s)]
*  that's free from this type of barbarism and horrors [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=162.22s)]
*  that have been put on all people, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=165.57999999999998s)]
*  also the Palestinians by a group like Hamas. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=167.34s)]
*  And to get to that, I think there's still [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=170.06s)]
*  a lot of hard fighting ahead. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=171.66s)]
*  And there's not a lot of confidence that negotiation [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=173.32s)]
*  with a group like Hamas is going to be fruitful. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=175.68s)]
*  It hasn't been since 2008. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=178.38s)]
*  Yeah, we're waiting to hear from Israeli Prime Minister [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=180.28s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu, who may be speaking soon, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=183.84s)]
*  so we're waiting on that. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=185.79999999999998s)]
*  But there is this picture out of the White House [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=186.56s)]
*  from the Biden administration of Vice President Harris, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=188.4s)]
*  of President Biden, of other American leaders [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=190.56s)]
*  in the situation room, as it's called, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=194.2s)]
*  looking like they're working, particularly on this. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=196.44s)]
*  What do you make of this picture? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=199.2s)]
*  What's the message they're trying to send? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=201.12s)]
*  Does it change anything? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=203.16s)]
*  Is this a message of strength [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=204.24s)]
*  that they're trying to portray? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=205.68s)]
*  I'm not sure it really sends much of any message, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=208.44s)]
*  other than that they came in on a weekend [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=211.32s)]
*  to discuss a national issue where an American citizen [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=213.84s)]
*  was killed by Hamas over the weekend. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=217.44s)]
*  It's less clear if there's going to be [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=220.2s)]
*  any new grand negotiation, because Biden has not put [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=222.04s)]
*  more pressure on the parties on the table [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=226.6s)]
*  or changed the dynamics on the ground. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=228.96s)]
*  And until the IDF and Hamas actually finish their fight, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=230.88s)]
*  I don't see much changing that's gonna have a breakthrough [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=234.56s)]
*  on the negotiations, so photo ops don't really give much. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=237.44s)]
*  It's interesting, the reporting out of Israel, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=242.12s)]
*  this is the times of Israel, but this is something [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=244.12s)]
*  that's been going back and forth all across Israel [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=246.72s)]
*  and the media, the back and forth between the leadership [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=248.68s)]
*  in Israel pushing back on Prime Minister Netanyahu's [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=251.8s)]
*  insistence on holding this corridor in the south, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=255.24s)]
*  the Philadelphia corridor. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=257.56s)]
*  And Defense Minister Youav Galant [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=259.24s)]
*  in the Security Council meeting said, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=261.32s)]
*  the fact that we prioritize the Philadelphia corridor [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=262.59999999999997s)]
*  at the cost of the lives of hostages is a moral disgrace. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=264.92s)]
*  They're rather openly having a bit of a back and forth, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=268.44s)]
*  at least in the Israeli press, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=271.4s)]
*  on military strategy on negotiations. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=275.0s)]
*  Your thoughts on that? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=277.28s)]
*  Well, I would defer to the actual operational commanders [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=280.2s)]
*  that are trying to execute operations to destroy Hamas, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=283.2s)]
*  and then secondly, those forces that are engaged [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=286.96000000000004s)]
*  in trying to locate and release the hostages safely. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=289.40000000000003s)]
*  And if that Philadelphia corridor is critical to that, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=293.32s)]
*  then I think on firm operational grounds, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=296.6s)]
*  then I think the Israelis should not give into that. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=299.12s)]
*  But again, it's the operational commanders [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=301.36s)]
*  that should be deferred to, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  and not the political leadership of the IDF. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=305.12s)]
*  Brett Sadler, thank you very much. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=307.8s)]
*  Very difficult situation. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzeWW_Vv1wo&t=309.24s)]
