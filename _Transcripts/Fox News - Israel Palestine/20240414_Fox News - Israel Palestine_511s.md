# Kirby defends Biden’s approach to Iran: How could you say he’s gone ‘soft?’
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo)
*  White House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome back, always good to have you with us. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=3.6s)]
*  Thanks, Shannon. Good to be here. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=5.08s)]
*  I want to play something the president said just a couple of days ago about where we are [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=6.44s)]
*  in our support of Israel in light of the Iran attack. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  As I told Prime Minister Netanyahu, our commitment to Israel's security against these threats from Iran [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  and its proxies is ironclad. Let me say it again, ironclad. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=20.64s)]
*  That's a word we've heard again and again, but Axios reporting this morning that President Biden [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  told Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu during a call on Saturday that the U.S. will not support [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=29.36s)]
*  any Israeli counterattack against Iran, that's according to a senior White House official. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=35.04s)]
*  So where are we with Israel with respect to responding to this attack? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=39.44s)]
*  Well, I think first we need to see what the war cabinet decides in terms of whatever next step [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  they want to pursue, and that's a sovereign decision, of course, that our Israeli counterparts [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=48.08s)]
*  have to make. But I don't think you can look at what happened last night in any way, shape or form [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  and not come away convinced that the president meant every word he said, ironclad commitment. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=58.16s)]
*  I mean, several hundred drones and missiles launched in the course of several hours, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=62.72s)]
*  and almost every single one of them knocked out of the sky and didn't make it into Israel. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=68.24s)]
*  And that's not by accident. That's a terrific testament to the superiority of the Israeli [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=72.88s)]
*  military, but also to our own military superiority and the effort, the risk, the resources that [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=78.08s)]
*  President Biden committed to helping defend Israel. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=84.4s)]
*  But what are we saying to them now about a response they may choose? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=86.64s)]
*  I think, again, it's going to be up to the Israelis to decide what the next step is here. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=89.92s)]
*  I will just say this. President Biden, since the beginning of this conflict, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=95.44s)]
*  has worked very hard to keep this from becoming a broader regional war, to keep the tensions from [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=99.28s)]
*  escalating. Everything he's done, everything he's moved in the region, every decision, every [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=103.92s)]
*  discussion that he's had is all designed to not let this become a broader regional war, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=108.64s)]
*  and that's where his head still is. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=113.28s)]
*  So we have been very public, this administration, about critiquing Israel's moves, especially when [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=114.72s)]
*  it comes to things like moving into Ra'a, which they say Hamas is an existential threat that [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=121.28s)]
*  remains there. Yes, hiding behind human shields, but we've been managing that a bit. Are we also [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=125.36s)]
*  going to manage how they respond to Iran? Well, again, I think we have to wait and [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=130.96s)]
*  see what the Israelis decide to do. I don't know. I've been around allies and alliances [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  my whole professional life, and I can't think of a single one where, if it's a real alliance, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=138.48s)]
*  where you can't have honest conversations with one another a little bit every now and then, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=142.64s)]
*  and take issue with the way something might be done. We're not bashful about that with our good [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=147.44s)]
*  friend Israel. But the other thing we're not bashful about, and certainly President Biden's [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=151.67999999999998s)]
*  not been bashful about, is making sure that when we say we're going to help Israel defend itself, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  by goodness, we're going to put something behind that. And we did that last night. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=161.04s)]
*  You know, there are a number of critics, most of them on the GOP side of the Hill, who say [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  we shouldn't be in this position, that there are things that were done by this administration [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=168.88s)]
*  that let Iran think it had an opening here or others that would go after Israel. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=172.72s)]
*  Senator Marshall Blackburn, among those posting on X last night, she says, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=176.8s)]
*  under President Trump, Iran was broke. President Biden gifted them billions of dollars and then [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=180.16s)]
*  naively said, don't. Don't is not a foreign policy. We also heard from Congressman Michael Waltz, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=184.96s)]
*  like you, a veteran who's worn the uniform. He says this about us refusing to be tougher on Iran [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=190.72s)]
*  at the UN. Here's a bit of that. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=196.32s)]
*  Just last year, we refused to push the UN to renew sanctions on Iran's drone and missile program. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=198.95999999999998s)]
*  Now they're literally flying towards Israel. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=205.76s)]
*  You know, the conversations about unfreezing assets, about waivers on sanctions. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=209.2s)]
*  Could this administration have been tougher on Iran? Did it sense an opening? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  It's hard to look at what President Biden has done with respect to Iran and say that he hasn't [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=217.92s)]
*  been tough on Iran, that we haven't put pressure on them, that we haven't additional 500 sanctions, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=222.72s)]
*  additional resources in the region. And let's take a look at that ballistic missile. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=229.04s)]
*  OK, so they launched more than 100 ballistic missiles and how many got through? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=232.96s)]
*  And the reason they didn't get through is because President Biden made sure that we [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=236.96s)]
*  pre-positioned forces in the region to help Israel shoot them down. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=240.0s)]
*  So this vaunted ballistic missile program of theirs didn't turn out to be so vaunted last night. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=244.4s)]
*  Support something that would have stopped that program or at least contained it in some way. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=248.56s)]
*  So it's not launching in Israel and we aren't having to get it involved defensively. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=252.0s)]
*  Again, Shannon, just look at the sanctions that we put in place against Iran. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=255.6s)]
*  Look at the resources we put in this and into the region. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=258.72s)]
*  It's hard to take a look at what President Biden has done and say that we've somehow gone soft [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=261.6s)]
*  on Iran. It was the previous administration that decided to get us out of the Iran deal. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=266.0s)]
*  And now Iran is so much dramatically closer to a potential nuclear weapon capability than they were [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=270.48s)]
*  before Mr. Trump was elected. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=277.36s)]
*  Is it not fair to say, though, that there have been moves by this administration that have opened [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=279.12s)]
*  up cash and other opportunities for them, which we know are fungible in ways that are not helping [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=283.2s)]
*  the Iranian people but are benefiting the elites and people there who chant death to America? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=287.92s)]
*  You and I have had this fungibility argument before. I obviously take a different issue [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=293.6s)]
*  or take an issue with that characterization. The sanctions relief that has come about or [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=298.4s)]
*  it's not even sanctions relief, but the additional funds that have been made available to [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=305.12s)]
*  Iran due to sanctions relief program that the Trump administration put in place can only be [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=309.6s)]
*  used for humanitarian goods. It doesn't go to the regime. And the idea that the regime was somehow [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=314.32000000000005s)]
*  felt like they were freed up to support these proxies because of that, it just doesn't [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=320.24s)]
*  comport with the facts. They have been supporting these proxies for many, many years. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=324.32000000000005s)]
*  And it comports with their language, though, saying we will use this money in the way that [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=327.76000000000005s)]
*  we want to use it. They can't. They physically can't do that. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=331.44s)]
*  OK, let's talk about China because there's plenty of reporting that the administration [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=335.44s)]
*  have been talking to China, wanting them to use their influence with Tehran to sort of head off [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=338.96s)]
*  these attacks. Yeah. They've been a number of visits. Secretary Yellen is just back. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=343.12s)]
*  Our presidents have been speaking. Secretary Blinken is supposed to be going to do meetings [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=347.36s)]
*  in China as well. But this comes at a time, first of all, that we know China is the number one oil [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=351.68s)]
*  customer for Iran. And also this week reports that they are supplying critical elements to Russia [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=356.88s)]
*  to help it, you know, gin up its weapon system and be able to go after Ukraine. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=362.71999999999997s)]
*  This relationship with China does not seem to be working to our advantage. They don't [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=368.4s)]
*  seem worried about any of the warnings from us, any of the visits from us. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=371.68s)]
*  Well, look, I won't just dispute the fact that China can do more. China should do more in terms [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=374.56s)]
*  of the Middle East, in terms of the relationship that they have with Tehran. And yes, we've asked [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=379.28s)]
*  them to use that influence to a positive effect. I'll let President Xi speak to what he is or [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=383.36s)]
*  isn't willing to do, but they have not put that kind of pressure on Tehran. And we certainly want [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=388.40000000000003s)]
*  them to do that. But China's also not the leader in the region that maybe they want to be or to [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=394.24s)]
*  claim to be. The United States, however, as demonstrated last night, very much is in a [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=402.72s)]
*  leadership position in the region. Let's talk about aid because that was one of the first things that [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=407.2s)]
*  heated up again last night. A number of senators, House members taking to action to other places, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=411.44s)]
*  issuing statements saying it's time to get aid for Israel passed. The House has done a standalone [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=416.16s)]
*  measure for Israel. Obviously, the bigger package the White House would like to see has come through [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=420.32s)]
*  the Senate. What would you like to see this week? Would the White House sign something that comes [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=424.56s)]
*  as a standalone aid measure for Israel if it gets to the president's desk? You know, you take a look [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=429.68s)]
*  at last night and you take a look at what's happening on the eastern flank there in Ukraine [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=434.4s)]
*  around the Donbass. Speed, time is of the essence. And the fastest way to be able to support [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=439.12s)]
*  our partners in Ukraine and our ally in Israel is to move forward with the Senate passed in a [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=444.8s)]
*  bipartisan way. That bipartisan bill gets the funding to Ukraine. It gets the funding to Israel. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=451.36s)]
*  It also helps us on the Indo-Pacific and the border. And we know, Shannon, that if that [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=456.16s)]
*  bipartisan legislation gets to the floor in the House, it will pass. There's enough votes for it. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=460.56s)]
*  Our message is to the Speaker, get that on the floor. Let's get it voted on so that that aid can [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=467.04s)]
*  get to Israel and to Ukraine in the fastest possible way and not have to go back to the [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=472.0s)]
*  Senate for renegotiating. It's solid. It's a solid piece of legislation. They should move on it. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=476.72s)]
*  If they don't, though, and send you something standalone, would the president not sign [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=482.0s)]
*  an aid bill for Israel? I won't get ahead of the president's decision space one way or another. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=485.68s)]
*  I mean, we'll have to see what makes it his way. It makes the way to his desk. But again, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=490.08s)]
*  the fastest way to support our friends is to move that Senate bill forward and get it on the House [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=495.68s)]
*  on the House floor. Well, the House sounds as if it's going to change up its schedule this week [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=501.68s)]
*  and get something, try to get something moving. We certainly hope so. It's that Senate package. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=505.36s)]
*  Admiral, always appreciate your time. You bet. Thank you so much. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdTdZknpJQo&t=508.56s)]
