# Trump official skeptical on Putin's expansion hopes: 'Much different situation'
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [March 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY)
*  Joining us now, U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, has also been [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=0.0s)]
*  taking part in those talks between Ukraine and Russia on behalf of the White House. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=4.32s)]
*  Welcome to Fox News Sunday. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=8.56s)]
*  Thank you, Shannon. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=12.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=13.0s)]
*  So we know more talks are set to go between Ukraine and Russia and Saudi Arabia tomorrow, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=14.0s)]
*  and yet we continue to see these attacks, like we've seen in Odessa, like we've seen [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=17.740000000000002s)]
*  in Kyiv, leading to death and destruction. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=21.28s)]
*  The ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jean Shaheen, says this. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=24.48s)]
*  When Trump asked for the killing to stop, Putin refused. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=28.64s)]
*  Putin does not want peace, and it is time for the president to realize that. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=31.84s)]
*  Are you convinced he wants peace? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=36.84s)]
*  I feel that he wants peace. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=40.68s)]
*  The president had two very productive calls this week, or last week, I should say, one [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=42.04s)]
*  with President Zelensky, one with President Putin. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=48.040000000000006s)]
*  I was in on, I sat and listened to both of them. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=52.32s)]
*  In both conversations, it was all about a lasting peace. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=55.48s)]
*  Lots of progress got made last week. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=60.64s)]
*  The parties agreed to an energy infrastructure moratorium on attacks for energy infrastructure. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=62.76s)]
*  I think that you're going to see in Saudi Arabia on Monday some real progress, particularly [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=71.32s)]
*  as it affects a Black Sea ceasefire on ships between both countries. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  From that, you'll naturally gravitate into a full-on shooting ceasefire. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=85.08s)]
*  Okay, you have said recently, you don't quote, I don't regard Putin as a bad guy. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=90.52s)]
*  You said you feel like you can negotiate with him, but here's how the National Review describes [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=95.88s)]
*  him. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  They said he's a tyrant who murders, maims, and imprisons his critics, who has abolished [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=100.75999999999999s)]
*  civil society and independent media in Russia, who has invaded a neighbor. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=105.52s)]
*  Engulfing that country in violence for the purpose of crushing and subjugating it goes [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=109.96s)]
*  on to say that Russian forces have committed mass kidnapping, torture, rape, and murder [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=114.6s)]
*  under Putin's guidance and leadership. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  So where do you get to that assessment about him not being a bad guy? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=122.16s)]
*  You know, Shannon, I met with President Putin twice at the direction of the president because [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=127.91999999999999s)]
*  everything I do is at his direction. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=133.6s)]
*  And they were productive meetings. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=136.2s)]
*  We accomplished quite a bit. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=139.92s)]
*  We opened channels of communication. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=141.64s)]
*  President Putin told me at the first meeting that he had had no conversation with the prior [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=144.44s)]
*  administration, in particular President Biden, for three and a half years. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=149.16s)]
*  I'm not sure how anyone would expect an end to a conflict when you're not communicating. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=153.52s)]
*  So we had a very, very good conversation, productive. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=158.28s)]
*  We discussed real ways to end this conflict. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=162.2s)]
*  That led to a second conversation, first conversation being close to three and a half hours, second [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=166.84s)]
*  conversation being in that time, in that space as well, three and a half or four hours. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=171.76s)]
*  That led to a green... [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=177.76s)]
*  By the end of the second conversation, we had proposals on an energy infrastructure [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=181.0s)]
*  ceasefire and a Black Sea moratorium on firing on each other's ships. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=186.39999999999998s)]
*  And these things had been on the shelf for several years. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  So I think that's commendable on the part of all of the parties. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=195.68s)]
*  This is at President Trump's direction. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=201.36s)]
*  His philosophy of peace through strength brings people to the table to clear up misconceptions [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=203.8s)]
*  and to get peace deals done. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=210.32s)]
*  And that's exactly what's happening right now. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=211.88s)]
*  Do you feel like there's a misconception though about the characterization of him as a tyrant [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  or someone whose political opponents often disappear or die? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=217.44s)]
*  I think in my 68 years on this earth, I've never, ever seen a situation where there isn't [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=223.64s)]
*  two sides to a story. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=229.8s)]
*  It's just never as black and white as people want to portray. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=231.4s)]
*  So there are grievances on both sides, but our job and at the direction, again, I stress [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=235.8s)]
*  of the president, our job is to narrow the issues, bring the parties together and stop [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=242.20000000000002s)]
*  the killing. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=248.32000000000002s)]
*  That's the game plan. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=249.68s)]
*  And that's what we're all there to do. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=250.96s)]
*  And I think that we're doing a pretty effective job of it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=253.52s)]
*  I think you'll see a lot more progress get announced after Monday. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=256.20000000000005s)]
*  You seem convinced that he doesn't want to expand the territory beyond what he's taken now. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=261.04s)]
*  I know there's going to be a conversation about how much of that Ukraine does or doesn't get back, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=265.84000000000003s)]
*  but you're convinced that he's not going to go further or have aspirations towards Europe. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=270.32000000000005s)]
*  Obviously, they're concerned about that being much closer to this geographically. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=274.72s)]
*  But 2014, we had Crimea. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=279.12s)]
*  That hasn't come back. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=281.20000000000005s)]
*  And he's gone far beyond that in this most recent attack on Ukraine. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=283.2s)]
*  So why are you convinced that he won't press further if he's given some reward or some [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=287.92s)]
*  territory this time around? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=292.08s)]
*  Well, look, he's been at war for several years. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=296.72s)]
*  In large part, been about those five regions. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=300.96000000000004s)]
*  And it's in his speeches. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=304.8s)]
*  It's there is a view within the country of Russia that these are Russian territories, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=306.96s)]
*  that there are referendums within these territories that justify these actions. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=313.92s)]
*  This is not me taking sides. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=320.0s)]
*  I'm just identifying what the issues are. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=322.16s)]
*  I don't I've never seen a conflict that can be resolved without level setting the facts. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=324.4s)]
*  And these and we're level setting the facts. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=330.96s)]
*  Now, I've been asked my opinion. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=332.8s)]
*  So about what what President Putin's motives are on a larger scale. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=335.28s)]
*  And I simply have said that I just don't see that he wants to take all of Europe. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=342.08s)]
*  This is a much different situation than it was in World War Two. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=346.88s)]
*  In World War Two, there was no NATO. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=350.47999999999996s)]
*  So I just you have countries that are armed there. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=353.36s)]
*  To me, it just it just does. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=357.36s)]
*  I take him at his word in this sense. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=358.71999999999997s)]
*  So and I think the Europeans are beginning to come to that belief, too. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=360.47999999999996s)]
*  It sort of doesn't matter. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=364.71999999999997s)]
*  That's an academic issue. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=366.23999999999995s)]
*  The real issue here, the agenda set forth by President Trump, he is my boss. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=367.76s)]
*  And I adhere to that fact that the agenda is stop the killing, stop the carnage. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=372.79999999999995s)]
*  Let's end this thing. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=379.52s)]
*  You can't end things without communicating with both sides, understanding what each of them need, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=380.79999999999995s)]
*  and then trying to bring them together. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=386.08s)]
*  And that's what we're doing. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=387.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=388.71999999999997s)]
*  We certainly hope that there's great progress in those talks this week, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=388.96s)]
*  getting to this point and now moving forward. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=392.4s)]
*  But I want to make sure while we have you that we ask about the Middle East, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=393.92s)]
*  where I know you've poured your heart into those negotiations as well. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=396.24s)]
*  Clearly, the ceasefire is broken there. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=399.52000000000004s)]
*  I know that you said Hamas has been unreasonable in trying to respond to another round of the next [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=402.64000000000004s)]
*  phase of a ceasefire. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=407.28000000000003s)]
*  Where do we go from here? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=408.96000000000004s)]
*  What are the odds you get them back to the table and get these hostages home? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=411.20000000000005s)]
*  Well, I certainly hope we get everybody back to the table and get the hostages home. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=416.40000000000003s)]
*  I was in Doha. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=420.4s)]
*  I met with many of the Arab leaders at the Arab summit. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=424.0s)]
*  I thought we had a deal, an acceptable deal. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=428.08s)]
*  I even thought we had an approval from Hamas. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=431.91999999999996s)]
*  Maybe that's just me getting duped. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=434.96s)]
*  But I thought we were there. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=441.28s)]
*  And evidently, we weren't. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=443.03999999999996s)]
*  So this is on Hamas. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=444.56s)]
*  The United States stands with the state of Israel. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=446.0s)]
*  There's just that's a 100% commitment. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=448.56s)]
*  And we've expressed that. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=452.48s)]
*  Hamas had every opportunity to demilitarize, to accept the bridging proposal that would have [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=454.56s)]
*  given us a 40 or 50 day ceasefire where we could have discussed demilitarization and a final truce. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=461.84000000000003s)]
*  There were all kinds of opportunities to do that. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=469.12s)]
*  And they elected not to. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=471.52s)]
*  And this becomes the alternative. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=473.36s)]
*  And it is unfortunate. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=475.68s)]
*  Do I think if would we be amenable to a reach out from Hamas? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=477.52s)]
*  Of course we would be. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=483.03999999999996s)]
*  No different than in the Russian conflict. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=484.56s)]
*  We want to end the killing. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=486.4s)]
*  But we need to be clear who the aggressor is here. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=488.08s)]
*  And that is Hamas. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=492.24s)]
*  Quickly, I want to ask you before you go about Iran. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=493.76s)]
*  The president has sent a letter to the supreme leader there giving a timetable for negotiations [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=496.08s)]
*  over their new program. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=500.24s)]
*  Two months. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=501.76s)]
*  What happens if you get to the end of the two months without progress? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=502.47999999999996s)]
*  Well, this follows exactly the talking points that me and you have just gone over in Russia, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=504.88s)]
*  Ukraine, in the Middle East, and now Iran. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=510.96s)]
*  Again, our direction, the president made a very, very big move in my view. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=514.0s)]
*  It was to reach out to Iran. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=521.84s)]
*  There are many out there who would have thought that Iran in their position would have reached [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=524.24s)]
*  out to us. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=528.24s)]
*  But we weren't waiting. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=529.68s)]
*  And it's not a surprise that we were waiting. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=530.64s)]
*  But we weren't waiting. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=533.1999999999999s)]
*  And it's not a sign of weakness. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=534.24s)]
*  It's a sign of strength. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=535.52s)]
*  We don't need to solve everything militarily. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=537.12s)]
*  It's not to say that if, gosh, if, God forbid, we're pushed to that point that we're not [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=539.92s)]
*  going to use military action. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=545.68s)]
*  We would under certain circumstances. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=549.1999999999999s)]
*  But here we're giving our signal to Iran is let's sit down and see if we can, through [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=552.64s)]
*  dialogue, through diplomacy, get to the right place. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=559.36s)]
*  If we can, we're prepared to do that. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=563.28s)]
*  And if we can't, the alternative is not a great alternative. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=565.44s)]
*  And I need to be clear so everybody understands President Trump's position on this. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=568.8000000000001s)]
*  Iran cannot have a bomb. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=574.16s)]
*  We cannot allow them to proceed to weaponization and a nuclear arsenal. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=576.16s)]
*  It cannot happen and it will not happen. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=581.36s)]
*  Well, you've got several difficult assignments. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=583.44s)]
*  We know the president has great confidence in you and we wish you all the best in making [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=586.16s)]
*  progress on these really difficult foreign policy challenges. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=589.76s)]
*  Steve Wittkopf, thank you. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-mp2EwlaCY&t=593.36s)]
