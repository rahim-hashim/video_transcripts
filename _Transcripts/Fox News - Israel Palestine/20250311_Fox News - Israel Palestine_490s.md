# 'TOTAL CHAOS': Laura slams support for pro-Hamas students
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [March 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ)
*  A melting pot no more. That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=0.0s)]
*  All right, most Americans would be shocked to learn that non-citizens have the right to enter [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=5.28s)]
*  our country, advocate for the overthrow of the United States, disrupt the education of [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=9.84s)]
*  thousands of students, create chaos on a college campus like Alexis just talked about, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=14.88s)]
*  and then run to our courts to protect them from the consequences of their own actions. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=20.0s)]
*  Now, from my perspective, even if the court precedent does give non-citizens certain rights, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=24.8s)]
*  free speech concerns don't really come into play if our officials, according to the terms of a [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=29.84s)]
*  statute duly passed, determine that a non-American poses a national security risk to the country. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=35.12s)]
*  Now, the statute in question is Section 237A4C of the INA, an alien whose presence or activities [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=41.44s)]
*  in the United States, the Secretary of State has reasonable grounds to believe what have potentially [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States is deportable. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=54.56s)]
*  Now, there is an exception in this law which states that an alien should not be deported [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=61.36s)]
*  because of the alien's past, current, or expected beliefs, statements, or associations, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=67.44s)]
*  if such belief statements or associations would be lawful within the United States. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=73.76s)]
*  Unless, and here's the key, the Secretary of State personally determines that the alien's [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=78.8s)]
*  admission would comprise a compelling United States foreign policy interest, compromise that [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=85.2s)]
*  interest. And in this case, what happened? Well, Secretary Rubio has made the determination in a [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=92.88s)]
*  letter that Mahmoud Khalil's ongoing presence would in fact compromise a compelling foreign [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=98.47999999999999s)]
*  policy interest. You with me? But the radicals, of course, are trying to use this as a way to [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=105.2s)]
*  scare you. If you believe in constitutional rights, if you understand that they're targeting this [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=112.0s)]
*  person and everyone knows he has been very vocal against the genocide of the Palestinian people in [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=117.36s)]
*  Gaza and they're targeting him and refusing him constitutional rights, who's next? As Rashida [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  Tlaib. Now, look, it's simply absurd to believe that our framers wrote our constitution to [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=130.16s)]
*  safeguard the rights of non-citizens whose entire goal is to seize power in the United States [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=135.52s)]
*  in order to benefit our enemies. And here's the bottom line. The left is trying to blow this up [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=142.88s)]
*  into a big story for their own political self-preservation. Why? They know there are [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=148.0s)]
*  a lot more Mahmoud Khalil's out there and they're living here, they're working here, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  they're studying here on student visas, on work visas, and it is their goal, the left's goal, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=158.48s)]
*  to normalize this notion of foreigners coming here and then advocating for the overthrow of [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=164.88s)]
*  our government, spewing this vile anti-Americanism and of course in this instance, anti-Semitism. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=169.76s)]
*  We know native-born radicals, we've seen this a lot, already hate America, but for now they're [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=177.12s)]
*  out of power and with Trump the tide seems to be turning against them. The truth is the hard left [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=182.8s)]
*  in the United States needs reinforcements from abroad to finish the job they started in earnest [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  under Obama. So these rabid lunatics do not have a positive theory about what America is supposed to [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=194.56s)]
*  be. To them, America and Americans are a blot on the global landscape. The sooner our country and [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=201.68s)]
*  Americans are gone, the better the world will be. Now think of the difference between how this new [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=209.52s)]
*  left thinks about our country, that it's systemically racist, it's imperialist, what the pro-Hamas people [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=215.35999999999999s)]
*  think, as compared to the way the old liberals thought about it. They thought America just needed [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=221.04s)]
*  to live up to its founding principles in order to succeed. That's what Martin Luther King believed. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=226.24s)]
*  Listen to the I had a dream speech, that's what JFK believed, that's what Abraham Lincoln, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=231.92s)]
*  of course Republican, but revered by the left believed. But today the hard left wants the entire [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=236.88s)]
*  system smashed. You see it on college campuses, that's what they want, upheaval. That's bad enough [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=242.72s)]
*  when we have American citizens believing this, but there is nothing in our history, nothing in basic [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=248.96s)]
*  common sense that compels us to admit foreigners, let them stay here, who believe any of this. This [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=254.88s)]
*  is a recipe for total chaos. Justice Robert H. Jackson writing in The Descent in Terminalo [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=261.44s)]
*  versus Chicago back in 1949 got it right. The choice is not between order and liberty. It is [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=268.0s)]
*  between liberty with order and anarchy without either. There is danger that if the court does [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=274.32s)]
*  not temper its doctrinaire logic with a little practical wisdom, it will convert the constitutional [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=280.96s)]
*  bill of rights into a suicide pact. This question of whether this Columbia grad threatens national [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=286.96s)]
*  security, it should be left up to the Secretary of State and the President. This individual is not [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=293.12s)]
*  an American citizen. He has whatever rights were given to him by statute. As I mentioned earlier, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=298.32s)]
*  the statute says it's up to Rubio to decide whether that individual poses a national security risk. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=304.4s)]
*  Now 1999, the Immigration Appeals Court ruling sent a letter from the Secretary of State laying [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=311.36s)]
*  out the serious adverse foreign policy consequences for our country is deemed presumptive. They don't [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=316.72s)]
*  have to do anymore. President Trump wrote on Truth Social today, if you support terrorism, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=323.44000000000005s)]
*  including the slaughtering of innocent men, women and children, your presence is contrary to our [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=328.96000000000004s)]
*  national and foreign policy interests. And you are not welcome here. And at the White House, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=334.8s)]
*  he drove the point home. We ought to get them all out of the country. They're troublemakers, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=340.64000000000004s)]
*  they're agitators. They don't love our country. We ought to get them the hell out. I think that [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=344.88s)]
*  guy we ought to get him. I heard his statements too. They were plenty bad. And I think we ought [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=349.28s)]
*  to get them the hell out of the country. I watched him. I watched tapes specifically. I watched tapes [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=353.52s)]
*  and you can have them. Okay. You can have them and you can have the rest of them. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=359.52s)]
*  If we continue to give safe haven to those who ultimately seek our destruction, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=366.0s)]
*  we'll eventually end up with a knife at our throats. Now, it doesn't have to be a mob on [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=370.8s)]
*  college campuses. It can be a single disaffected angry refugee, what some in Europe are calling [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=375.36s)]
*  low cost jihadists. A horrifying story in The Spectator. One of these low cost extremists was [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=381.84000000000003s)]
*  last week jailed for life by a French court. In October 2020, Tunisian Brahim Awasawi murdered [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=388.40000000000003s)]
*  three Christians with a knife outside a church in Nice. One of the victims, a 44 year old woman, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=395.52s)]
*  was stabbed 25 times. During his trial, Awasawi justified his actions by claiming, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=400.71999999999997s)]
*  you the West kill Muslims, women and children, these innocent people who die every day. Aren't [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=407.12s)]
*  they human? Don't they have families? The UAE's foreign minister tried to warn the West years ago. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=413.12s)]
*  There will come a day that we will see far more radical extremists and terrorists [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=419.84s)]
*  coming out of Europe because of lack of decision making, trying to be politically correct, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=427.52s)]
*  or assuming that they know the Middle East and they know Islam and they know the others [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=437.44s)]
*  far better than we do. And I'm sorry, but that's pure ignorance. Well, unfortunately, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=443.84s)]
*  ignorance is something we have a surplus of in our government, but no more. American citizenship [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=450.96s)]
*  for the foreign born is not a right. It's a privilege that we should be very carefully [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=456.56s)]
*  bestowing upon only the most deserving. America first. If it were up to me, I'd freeze all [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=462.71999999999997s)]
*  immigration until we really got a handle on who's here and why, until we deport the millions here [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=468.79999999999995s)]
*  illegally or who threatened our national security. And that includes Mr. Khalil. And that's the angle. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcWmJ8IxwQ&t=473.68s)]
