*  The IDF is now moving into the neighborhoods of Diraj and Tufa while the US still tries [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb6oLl3Ll7U&t=11.56s)]
*  to help the two sides bring an end to this war. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb6oLl3Ll7U&t=16.84s)]
*  You are watching Fox and Friends First on this Thursday morning. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb6oLl3Ll7U&t=20.68s)]
*  I'm Carly Schimke. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb6oLl3Ll7U&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  And I'm Todd Pyrro. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb6oLl3Ll7U&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  A lot going on in that region that we're going to start feeling right here at home. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb6oLl3Ll7U&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  We're going to get into that with Congress and Corey Mills in just a minute. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb6oLl3Ll7U&t=29.080000000000002s)]
*  But first Trey Yankst has a breaking update on the war from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb6oLl3Ll7U&t=32.2s)]
*  Hi Trey. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb6oLl3Ll7U&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  Hey Todd, Carly. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb6oLl3Ll7U&t=39.16s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb6oLl3Ll7U&t=39.84s)]
*  Israeli forces say they are close to completing the high intensity phase of this war in the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb6oLl3Ll7U&t=40.34s)]
*  northern part of Gaza. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb6oLl3Ll7U&t=45.88s)]
*  Much of their focus over the past 24 hours has been in Gaza's Jabaliga neighborhood where [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb6oLl3Ll7U&t=47.88s)]
*  Israeli troops from the 551st Brigade evacuated a group of civilians still in a building. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb6oLl3Ll7U&t=54.04s)]
*  Weapons were found at a school after that evacuation, according to the IDF. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb6oLl3Ll7U&t=60.04s)]
*  With more difficult ground fighting taking place in southern Gaza, the death toll is [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb6oLl3Ll7U&t=64.8s)]
*  rising among Israeli troops with a total of 137 killed since the ground operation began. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb6oLl3Ll7U&t=68.22s)]
*  The Israelis also say they discovered new tunnels in the heart of Gaza City that were [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb6oLl3Ll7U&t=74.8s)]
*  used by Hamas leadership. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb6oLl3Ll7U&t=78.56s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb6oLl3Ll7U&t=80.32s)]
*  From these infrastructures they were able to move and spread out in the strip. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb6oLl3Ll7U&t=83.04s)]
*  From the heart of Gaza City, the quarter of the leadership, they were able to go to Shefa [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb6oLl3Ll7U&t=87.72s)]
*  Hospital. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb6oLl3Ll7U&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  From it they leave in an ambulance and travel south and return to Shefa Hospital, entering [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb6oLl3Ll7U&t=94.2s)]
*  the network to move and go north and move toward Rantisi Hospital. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb6oLl3Ll7U&t=99.64000000000001s)]
*  The discovery comes as activity continues to increase on Israel's northern front. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb6oLl3Ll7U&t=106.68s)]
*  Last night Israeli strikes against southern Lebanon were more serious after new attacks [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb6oLl3Ll7U&t=111.2s)]
*  by the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb6oLl3Ll7U&t=115.08s)]
*  Hezbollah affiliated media reported 180 Israeli strikes against a single town near the border. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb6oLl3Ll7U&t=117.2s)]
*  We could not independently confirm that report. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb6oLl3Ll7U&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  The north certainly is getting more predictable as Israeli forces hope to wrap up operations [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb6oLl3Ll7U&t=125.58000000000001s)]
*  in certain parts of Gaza. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb6oLl3Ll7U&t=130.24s)]
*  They do have to keep their attention and posture high along the border with Lebanon. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb6oLl3Ll7U&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  Todd, Carly? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb6oLl3Ll7U&t=136.04000000000002s)]
*  Alright, Trey Yanks for us live for us in Tel Aviv. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb6oLl3Ll7U&t=137.04000000000002s)]
*  There's a new phase of this war set to begin. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb6oLl3Ll7U&t=139.0s)]
*  Trey, thank you. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb6oLl3Ll7U&t=141.0s)]
