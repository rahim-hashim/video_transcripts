# Two Israeli hostages released ahead of group release expected later
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM)
*  But first, Nate Foy, he is live in northern Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=0.0s)]
*  Hi, Nate. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=3.08s)]
*  Hey, Dana, Bill, good morning. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=5.66s)]
*  Breaking just in the past few minutes, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=6.66s)]
*  we are learning from the IDF [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=8.24s)]
*  that the Red Cross has in its care two Israeli hostages [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=9.94s)]
*  ahead of an expected larger hostage release. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=13.76s)]
*  Later tonight, we're learning that one of those two hostages [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=17.76s)]
*  named is Mia Shem, a 21-year-old woman. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=20.88s)]
*  They are on their way to Israel right now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=24.12s)]
*  Again, more hostages expected later. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=26.02s)]
*  And this comes, as you mentioned, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=28.24s)]
*  just hours after a Hamas terrorist attack in Jerusalem [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  that killed three people this morning. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=33.04s)]
*  We're gonna show you what we can from that attack. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=35.08s)]
*  I warn you, it is very disturbing. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=37.76s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=40.24s)]
*  You see the terrorists get out of their car in Jerusalem, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=41.08s)]
*  again, at a bus stop and open fire. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=43.44s)]
*  We stopped the video before they actually started shooting. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=45.84s)]
*  They killed two women, one man. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=49.06s)]
*  They sent several others to the hospital. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=51.239999999999995s)]
*  Reservists shot and killed the two terrorists [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=53.32s)]
*  who were brothers. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=55.36s)]
*  Now, during a meeting with US Secretary of State [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=56.44s)]
*  Antony Blinken this morning, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=58.559999999999995s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=59.919999999999995s)]
*  said Israel will stop at nothing to eliminate Hamas. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=62.199999999999996s)]
*  Secretary Blinken said the US remains focused [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  on supporting Israel [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=68.4s)]
*  while also helping the innocent people in Gaza. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  This process is producing results. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=73.52s)]
*  It's important, and we hope that it can continue. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=76.32s)]
*  The same time, I look forward to detailed conversations [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=80.12s)]
*  with the government of Israel [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=84.16s)]
*  about the way ahead in Gaza. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=87.47999999999999s)]
*  Now, 49-year-old American Israeli, Liat Benin, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  is waking up in Israel today [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=95.16s)]
*  for the first time since October 7th. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=96.96s)]
*  The mother of three was kidnapped from her kibbutz [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=99.8s)]
*  with her husband, who remains in Hamas captivity, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=102.06s)]
*  along with at least seven Americans. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=104.88s)]
*  Meanwhile, three Palestinian prisoners [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=107.6s)]
*  for every Israeli hostage are returning home as well. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=109.6s)]
*  Last night, another 30 Palestinians [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  reunited with their families. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=115.56s)]
*  You see that here. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=117.2s)]
*  Now, as for the hostages [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=118.48s)]
*  that are set to be released later today, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=119.92s)]
*  the parents of a 17- and 18-year-old sister and brother [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=122.62s)]
*  confirmed that their children are on that list, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=126.54s)]
*  and this is as two hostages are already coming back to Israel, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=129.68s)]
*  but Mia Shem is one of them. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=134.12s)]
*  That is not one of those two children. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=136.16s)]
*  So we'll keep working to learn more [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=138.76s)]
*  about who else is on that list. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=140.68s)]
*  We'll send it back to you. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=142.72s)]
*  All right, Nate Foy, stay safe and keep us posted. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslullmInyM&t=143.64000000000001s)]
