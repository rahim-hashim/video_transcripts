# Military expert warns the conflict heating up in Beirut has dangerous consequences
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [July 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs)
*  Let's bring back retired Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg for more perspective on this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=0.0s)]
*  So Lebanon's foreign minister, Abdallah Abu Habib, is saying that he hopes for a proportionate [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=4.96s)]
*  response by Hezbollah, quote, so that this wave of killing will stop. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=10.36s)]
*  I mean, it shows the tangled web of Lebanese politics when you have the foreign minister [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=14.36s)]
*  saying, I hope Hezbollah will launch a proportionate attack. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=19.16s)]
*  I mean, clearly, we know who's running the country there. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=22.36s)]
*  And what do you think Hezbollah will do? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=25.8s)]
*  Because just a couple of days ago, Hezbollah was saying that they were prepared to withdraw [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=28.04s)]
*  north of the Latani River if Israel were to stop its attacks. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=32.28s)]
*  And then everything went all sixes and sevens. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=36.64s)]
*  Yeah, John, again, thanks for having me again. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=41.28s)]
*  Look, to start with, Hezbollah should have been out of that region 20 years ago because [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=43.28s)]
*  there was a UN Security Council resolution, 1701, said they're supposed to withdraw, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=48.599999999999994s)]
*  in fact disarm, Hezbollah north of the Latani River. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=53.08s)]
*  They haven't done that. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=55.76s)]
*  Second, I think what you're seeing is you not to be a pessimist, but I think you're [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=56.96s)]
*  starting to see an escalatory cycle that is going to get quite dangerous because if Hezbollah [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=61.32s)]
*  does respond, be it Haifa or goes into Tel Aviv, then the Israelis got no option but [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=65.96s)]
*  go really, really hard back into Lebanon against Hezbollah. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=72.08s)]
*  And I think that is very, very probable right now. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=77.52s)]
*  I don't think Hezbollah will take their foot off the gas at all. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=80.0s)]
*  I think everybody you've had on before has been very, very clear. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=83.2s)]
*  Part of this issue is that we have not been very determinant, being very clear, very [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=86.44s)]
*  concise on our support of Israel. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=90.36s)]
*  And Tehran needs to know that and Hezbollah needs to know that and the Houthis need to [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=93.0s)]
*  know that and Hamas needs to know that. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=97.6s)]
*  And we haven't sent that signal. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=99.56s)]
*  Look, the rockets that drew those schoolchildren that were playing soccer, that was a Falak-1 [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=101.0s)]
*  rocket. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=108.28s)]
*  That is made by only one country, Iran. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=109.46s)]
*  They know through the forensics where that rocket came from, who shot it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=112.32s)]
*  And Hezbollah can say all they want, but they know where the rocket came from, who made [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=116.08s)]
*  it and what it was intended to do. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=120.36s)]
*  And I think you're going to see the Israelis be unafraid to go very, very hard on Hezbollah. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  Look, the war cabinet right now in Israel is really Ron Dermer, former ambassador to [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=127.84s)]
*  the United States from Israel. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=133.68s)]
*  It's Golan, their secretary of defense, and Netanyahu. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=135.4s)]
*  The Knesset is out of session. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=139.08s)]
*  That means they cannot take any political action against Netanyahu. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=140.88s)]
*  His hands are kind of freed right now to do what he wants to do. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=144.36s)]
*  The only concern I would have with Israel going into Lebanon right now is, do they have [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=147.46s)]
*  the logistics backup to be able to do that? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=151.94s)]
*  They've been fighting for over nine months in Hamas. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=154.06s)]
*  They've expended a lot of munitions. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=156.54s)]
*  We have not backfilled those munitions. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=158.4s)]
*  As you made the comment earlier, Netanyahu came with a shopping list, and they haven't [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=160.98000000000002s)]
*  gotten it yet. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=165.66s)]
*  But I think there'll be no option, especially if Hezbollah attacks hard into Israel. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=166.66s)]
*  The Israelis will respond, and this crisis just got more and more trickier to try to [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=170.62s)]
*  resolve. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=175.82s)]
*  And I think that's what we're heading to. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=176.82s)]
*  Also just hitting the wire right now, the Lebanese foreign minister is telling Reuters [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=179.26s)]
*  that Lebanon condemns Israeli strike plans to file complaint to the UN. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=182.98000000000002s)]
*  Also the Lebanese foreign minister hoping for a proportionate response by Hezbollah [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=188.42000000000002s)]
*  so that this wave of killing will stop. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=193.5s)]
*  Hezbollah is crossing the wires right now as we continue to report the breaking news. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=198.0s)]
*  General, thanks for hopping back on with us. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=201.56s)]
*  We'll continue to update you on this. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aExjHudZBs&t=203.56s)]
