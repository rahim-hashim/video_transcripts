# The fight in Israel ‘is our fight’: Nikki Haley
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE)
*  So these decisions that we're talking about, many of them can only be made by a president in terms of our involvement. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=0.0s)]
*  Right now, that is obviously Joe Biden. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=8.0s)]
*  But Republican presidential candidate and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley hopes that she will be in those shoes come 2025. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=10.4s)]
*  And she joins me now, Governor. Good to have you with us. Good to have you here today. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=18.68s)]
*  Thanks so much, Martha, for having me. Thank you. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=22.88s)]
*  So this is obviously a very difficult situation. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=25.04s)]
*  This is what the American people elect presidents to decide, because these decisions are so difficult. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=28.599999999999998s)]
*  You have hundreds of Americans who are currently trapped in Gaza and you have hostages, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  over 240 of them, including somewhere around 10 Americans who are down there as well. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=40.64s)]
*  So how would you negotiate this with Israel in terms of the pauses that might be required in order to to manage that situation? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=46.8s)]
*  What would you do? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  I think this is incredibly personal and should be personal for America. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=56.04s)]
*  And we've got, you know, you had 33 Americans lives lost. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=60.6s)]
*  You've got almost 20 hostages there. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=64.4s)]
*  You've got other people that we're trying to get out of Gaza. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=68.6s)]
*  Look, it's precision that we're trying to do. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=71.8s)]
*  I know Israel well enough. I dealt with them for two years every day. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=75.16s)]
*  And they want to save every single life. They want to bring every hostage home. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=79.68s)]
*  And so America should be working with them on how to do that. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=83.76s)]
*  But you don't do that with a pause. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=86.88000000000001s)]
*  You do that by understanding what is the threat to the hostages and what is the threat to America. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=89.04s)]
*  The threat to all of them is Iran. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  Iran is waving their flag, telling Hamas what to do. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=96.2s)]
*  They told Hamas to go and kill 1400 Jewish people. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=100.84s)]
*  They're the ones telling Hamas what to do. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=103.72s)]
*  We have to make sure Iran knows there will be hell to pay if they hurt any of our people. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=106.08000000000001s)]
*  But I've also been there and I've seen those tunnels. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=110.36000000000001s)]
*  And Martha, what makes this difficult is they could have those hostages in the tunnels. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=113.08000000000001s)]
*  They could have the hostages somewhere else. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=118.48s)]
*  But these tunnels are underneath schools. They're underneath hospitals. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=120.56s)]
*  They're underneath civilian sites. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=123.4s)]
*  And they do that because Hamas doesn't value life. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=125.28s)]
*  And they know that American Israel do value life. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=127.92s)]
*  So I don't think we need to tell Israel to take a pause. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=131.04000000000002s)]
*  We need to let Israel do what Israel needs to do, which is defeat and eliminate Hamas, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=134.12s)]
*  because Hamas is going to come after us, too. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=139.12s)]
*  Iran is going to come after us, because don't forget, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=141.16s)]
*  when they were dragging those naked bodies in the streets of Gaza, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  they were saying death to Israel, death to America. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=147.04s)]
*  So how do you respond? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  Because this is what the president is hearing as well and seeing. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=150.08s)]
*  When you see body bags in the Palestinian territory, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=153.36s)]
*  some of these are very small, these bags. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=156.32s)]
*  They have children in them. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=158.4s)]
*  What would you say to the American people as president when they push back [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=160.0s)]
*  and say this is not our fight and there are children being killed on both sides? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=164.72s)]
*  What would you say to them? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=169.08s)]
*  This is our fight. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=171.52s)]
*  It became our fight when we had, you know, 33 Americans die there on that day, October 7th. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  It is our fight because they took hostages. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=178.16s)]
*  But this is what I'll tell you. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=180.24s)]
*  You know, whether you see in these pro-Hamas rallies around the country, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=181.68s)]
*  which makes me sick to my stomach, because you are really focusing, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=185.28s)]
*  rallying and supporting a group that says death to America. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=190.0s)]
*  So first of all, we don't support any violence whatsoever. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  And the fact that they're doing this on campus is one thing. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  But the second thing is understand that Iran is doing this in conjunction with Russia and China. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=201.52s)]
*  See this holy alliance for what it is. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=208.08s)]
*  You've got China sending Iran billions of dollars by importing all of their oil. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  You've got Russia. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=216.16s)]
*  Basically, what did they do? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=217.52s)]
*  Russia's first call wasn't to Netanyahu when this happened in Israel. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  Who did he call? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=223.76s)]
*  He called Hamas and told them to come to Russia. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=224.72s)]
*  And in turn, Hamas said that Russia was their greatest friend. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=227.44s)]
*  So you have an unholy alliance of Russia, China and Iran, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  all agreeing on the fact that they don't want freedom anywhere and they hate America. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=234.32s)]
*  So we have to see this as personal. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=240.16s)]
*  We have to understand that eliminating Hamas is a way to kick the knees out from Iran. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=242.24s)]
*  And we've got to do that before they get to us, because we're acting like it's September 10th. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=247.6s)]
*  And I'm telling you, America better remember what September 12th felt like, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=252.24s)]
*  because we've got an open border and we've got terrorists that want to kill us, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=255.84s)]
*  and we need to start acting like it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=259.76s)]
*  Well, we heard that directly from the FBI director yesterday. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=261.04s)]
*  He said that the threat level to the United States is at, quote, a whole other level. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=264.16s)]
*  And that's a chilling reality that I think Americans have to accept right now. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=269.44s)]
*  So a number of Middle East experts are advising the president right now [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=274.64s)]
*  to hit strategic targets in Iran, to send the message there, to let Israel, in effect, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=279.28000000000003s)]
*  handle the situation in Gaza and the United States hit these very clear targets in Iran [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=287.04s)]
*  that will send a very clear message. Would you do that as president? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=293.52000000000004s)]
*  First of all, it's irresponsible that we've had almost 100 strikes during the Biden presidency [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=299.36s)]
*  on our military bases. As a wife of a combat veteran, one who is currently deployed and is [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=304.4s)]
*  very close to that area right now and dealing with some of those issues, what I'll tell you is [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=310.0s)]
*  this tit for tat is not what you want to do. When these strikes happen, the first thing you do is [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=315.91999999999996s)]
*  you go and you take out wherever it was that the strike happened. You take out their supplies. You [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=322.32s)]
*  take out their infrastructure. You take out whatever allowed them the ability to strike the [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=328.0s)]
*  military base in the first place. That's what he should be doing, not just being reactionary. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=332.64s)]
*  He needs to lead. You hit him once. That's what makes a difference. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=337.84s)]
*  Thank you so much, Governor. I hope we can have a longer conversation very soon. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_28C-poLE&t=340.88s)]
