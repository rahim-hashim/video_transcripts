# WATCH: Inside a Hamas tunnel under Gaza hospital
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Trd8YguYHQ)
*  First, we go to Trey Yankst. He joins us from Jerusalem this hour. He just returned after touring Hamas tunnels underneath Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Trd8YguYHQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Trey, share with us what you've seen. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Trd8YguYHQ&t=8.0s)]
*  Yeah, hey Jillian, good afternoon. With an expected ceasefire just hours away, Israeli forces are still battling Hamas in the heart of Gaza City. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Trd8YguYHQ&t=12.0s)]
*  We were there today amid those battles, and as the Israelis uncovered new tunnels. Take a look. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Trd8YguYHQ&t=21.0s)]
*  Right now we are under Gaza's Al-Shifa Hospital complex. These are the tunnels the Israelis say Hamas used to move weapons and fighters. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Trd8YguYHQ&t=30.0s)]
*  You can see this clay beneath the hospital. This is what Hamas was digging through when they built these tunnels. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Trd8YguYHQ&t=39.0s)]
*  The dark and damp corridors give you a sense of what it was like for those hostages when they were taken into Gaza on October 7th. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Trd8YguYHQ&t=46.0s)]
*  You can hear there the Israelis are still conducting new airstrikes against the northern part of the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Trd8YguYHQ&t=55.0s)]
*  It is shaking the ground, but in the tunnels beneath Gaza's Al-Shifa Hospital complex you can see a bathroom. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Trd8YguYHQ&t=62.0s)]
*  There's a kitchenette. Fighters were meant to stay here for weeks or even months at a time. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Trd8YguYHQ&t=70.0s)]
*  And the Israelis say this tunnel network is just the tip of the iceberg. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Trd8YguYHQ&t=77.0s)]
*  What we're getting now is the network of the tunnels. We got a command and control system room in a tunnel 100 meters from the hospital to the north. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Trd8YguYHQ&t=81.0s)]
*  Underneath the school, it's booby-trapped. We're going to open it. We're going to collect it. We're going to demolish it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Trd8YguYHQ&t=92.0s)]
*  The first time since the war began we had an opportunity to speak with Palestinian civilians, many of whom are evacuating to the southern part of the Strip. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Trd8YguYHQ&t=101.0s)]
*  We'll have more of that story tonight on Special Report. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Trd8YguYHQ&t=112.0s)]
*  But all of this comes as anticipation is growing with the possibility of a ceasefire just hours away. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Trd8YguYHQ&t=115.0s)]
*  Both Israel and Hamas say it's going to happen. We are waiting for the details on timing, but it could see dozens of Israelis return to their loved ones. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Trd8YguYHQ&t=121.0s)]
*  After 47 days of waiting. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Trd8YguYHQ&t=129.0s)]
*  Jillian? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Trd8YguYHQ&t=131.0s)]
*  So, hey Trey, it's John here. So you had an extraordinary opportunity there to see some of these tunnels that were underneath the hospital. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Trd8YguYHQ&t=132.0s)]
*  What part of the hospital were they under? And do you get the sense that there is a much more extensive network that Israel has yet to uncover? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Trd8YguYHQ&t=140.0s)]
*  So we were with Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, who is the top spokesman for the Israeli military. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Trd8YguYHQ&t=151.0s)]
*  And he indicated that the tunnel we were in that you saw in that video there actually connects to an exit in a school down the street. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Trd8YguYHQ&t=157.0s)]
*  And it gives you a sense of just how expansive these tunnels are. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Trd8YguYHQ&t=166.0s)]
*  They're not just within the hospital complex, but giving Hamas and Islamic Jihad the ability to move from one block to another without being detected. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Trd8YguYHQ&t=170.0s)]
*  Also, it gives you a sense how close these tunnels are to patients. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Trd8YguYHQ&t=178.0s)]
*  When we went into that tunnel just over a dirt mound, we saw Palestinians who are sheltering at the hospital waiting to be evacuated to the southern part of Gaza. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Trd8YguYHQ&t=182.0s)]
*  John? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Trd8YguYHQ&t=191.0s)]
*  Trey, thank you for joining us. We appreciate it as always. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Trd8YguYHQ&t=192.0s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Trd8YguYHQ&t=196.0s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Trd8YguYHQ&t=197.0s)]
