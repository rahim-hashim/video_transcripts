# Hamas' hostage release is not a Hallmark Christmas movie: Nathan Sales
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU)
*  This is from the Wall Street Journal editorial board. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=0.0s)]
*  Hamas holds everyone hostage, the terrorists, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=2.94s)]
*  trafficking human beings to achieve their bloody aims. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=5.32s)]
*  It argues, quote, the civilized world is rejoicing [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=8.56s)]
*  at the release of hostages after seven weeks of hell. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=11.6s)]
*  But that relief should not blind us [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  to the way the jihadists are manipulating human sentiment. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=18.64s)]
*  Hamas is using the hostages to play on Western respect [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=22.04s)]
*  for human life. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  Every day the truce lasts, the more time the jihadists have [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=26.48s)]
*  to regroup, slip out of Gaza, rearm, or plan more ambushes [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=29.8s)]
*  against Israelis, end of quote. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=34.08s)]
*  In focus now, Ambassador Nathan Sales, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  former ambassador at large and coordinator [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=38.4s)]
*  for counterterrorism, also the founding acting undersecretary, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=40.6s)]
*  former acting undersecretary for civilian security, democracy, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=44.92s)]
*  and human rights at the State Department. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=48.8s)]
*  Great to have you, Ambassador. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=51.16s)]
*  Look, I was trying to get a beat on who would say [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=52.68s)]
*  too many moms would have been separated from their kids. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=55.44s)]
*  Now that would be interesting coming from a group of terrorists. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=59.12s)]
*  I mean, this is the ultimate emotional manipulation. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=62.199999999999996s)]
*  Grateful to have those home, but look, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=67.44s)]
*  we have to wait day by day by day for the terrorists [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=69.2s)]
*  to tell us who's on the list. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=72.08s)]
*  Well, that's exactly right, Harris. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=74.24s)]
*  Look, there's no happy endings here. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=75.88s)]
*  We all rejoice at the release of these hostages from Gaza. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=77.52s)]
*  But this is not a Hallmark Christmas movie. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=82.56s)]
*  Every single one of the people who's come out [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=84.92s)]
*  has suffered unspeakable horror. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=87.68s)]
*  Their loved ones, their family members have been killed by Hamas, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=89.96s)]
*  or their family members or loved ones are still being held hostage by Hamas. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=93.88s)]
*  You mentioned little Abigail, four-year-old American citizen [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=97.6s)]
*  who turned four in Hamas captivity. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=100.6s)]
*  Her parents were killed. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=103.56s)]
*  The reason she survived was because she was able to crawl out [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=104.32s)]
*  from under the dead body of her father [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=107.72s)]
*  and make it to the neighboring home of her best friend. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  So make no mistake. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=113.88s)]
*  The sort of group that is capable of taking her hostage, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=116.03999999999999s)]
*  the sort of group like Hamas that is capable of holding on to a 10-month-old baby [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  by the name of Kefir, they're showing you what they are. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=125.44s)]
*  This is not a group of freedom fighters. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=129.16s)]
*  This is not a national liberation movement. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=131.24s)]
*  This is a terrorist organization, full stop. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=133.68s)]
*  Kefir, by the way, it's been 52 days. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=136.96s)]
*  So in a little bit, Kefir will be one. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=139.68s)]
*  Yes, he's already spent 10% of his life in a tunnel underneath Gaza, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=142.92s)]
*  separated from his family. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=148.11999999999998s)]
*  And we heard just a couple moments ago, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=149.92s)]
*  his name appears to be omitted from the current list [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=152.51999999999998s)]
*  of people who are going to be coming out today. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=155.79999999999998s)]
*  That is exactly the way Hamas plays this dirty game, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  by holding on to the most vulnerable, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  by trying to raise hopes in the civilized world that maybe dawn will break [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=164.79999999999998s)]
*  and then crushing all expectations. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=170.67999999999998s)]
*  Talk to me about how you negotiate, though, with... [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=173.32s)]
*  And you've got a background in counterterrorism. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=177.07999999999998s)]
*  So there's always the thought that you're dealing with one particular group, Hamas, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=180.32s)]
*  hostage-taking serial killers, as I call them. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=184.76s)]
*  But now the Islamic jihadists have got this group of unknown number of hostages as well. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=187.76s)]
*  I mean, are they passing them? Are they selling them? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=194.04s)]
*  What's going on behind the scenes? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=196.2s)]
*  And how many groups are... is Israel going to have to negotiate with? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=197.52s)]
*  Well, that's a great question, Harris, and we don't really know. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=202.08s)]
*  The one thing we do know, let's start with basics. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=205.24s)]
*  When you negotiate with terrorist groups like Hamas, like Islamic jihad or others, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=208.0s)]
*  you've got to do it from a position of strength. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=213.44s)]
*  And that appears to have been what Israel did during the past five weeks. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  The reason Hamas was prepared to release hostages, not enough and not fast enough, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=221.60000000000002s)]
*  but the reason they're prepared to release any at all was only because Israel subjected them [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=226.6s)]
*  to unrelenting pressure, taking thousands of their fighters and leaders off the battlefield. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=232.4s)]
*  Right, pressure on these groups, that's the only thing they understand. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=237.6s)]
*  Now, behind the scenes, who knows where some of these hostages are being held. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=241.36s)]
*  And that's why it's so important as we go forward into the possible extension of this deal [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=246.24s)]
*  for Israel to be prepared to resume force if Hamas goes back on its word. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=252.2s)]
*  And look, we know that the agreements that Hamas signed, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=257.47999999999996s)]
*  it's not worth the paper they're printed on. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=262.28s)]
*  They are serial hostage takers and killers. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=264.03999999999996s)]
*  They're also serial liars. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=266.44s)]
*  They've already gone back on some of their commitments to not separate mothers and children [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=268.52s)]
*  who are going to be released. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=273.64s)]
*  They almost tanked the deal on Saturday before last-minute intervention got it back on track. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=274.91999999999996s)]
*  So we can't take them at their word. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=280.92s)]
*  We've got to watch very carefully during these next crucial days [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=283.24s)]
*  as Israel considers whether or not to continue to extend this temporary pause. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=287.48s)]
*  Look, we don't know what it's like behind the scenes when the Israeli Defense Force [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=292.36s)]
*  has taken out some of their leadership. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=296.76s)]
*  I mean, you can't really definitively tell, well, did they pass some on, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=299.0s)]
*  who's in charge of that group, so on and so forth. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=303.24s)]
*  This is not the same command and control that started 52 days ago when Israel said, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=305.32s)]
*  this is it. This is war. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=310.68s)]
*  We'll cover every second. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=312.76s)]
*  Ambassador, it's always great to get your perspective and expertise on this. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=313.88s)]
*  And God bless the people who are waiting and those coming home. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=317.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBZkg-oCrAU&t=320.84000000000003s)]
