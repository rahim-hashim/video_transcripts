# What is the next phase of the Israel-Hamas war?
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk)
*  John? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=0.0s)]
*  All right, let's bring in retired U.S. Army Lieutenant [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=0.84s)]
*  General Keith Kellogg, Fox News contributor. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  General, thanks for jumping in the chair for us [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  because we wanted to ask you about this increased [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  ground activity that the IDF says it's undertaking tonight. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  It's about nine o'clock at night there in Israel. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=13.92s)]
*  Trey Yngst is telling us that this is not yet [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=20.64s)]
*  a full ground operation, but based on what you've seen [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=23.52s)]
*  with increased air attacks, artillery attacks [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=26.88s)]
*  in northern Gaza, now ground operations, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=29.06s)]
*  what would you surmise it is that the IDF [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=31.34s)]
*  is engaging in tonight? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=33.379999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, John, thanks for having me. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=36.339999999999996s)]
*  Look, what you're seeing is a prep of the battlefield, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=37.58s)]
*  and they're doing this, and they've been doing this [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=39.9s)]
*  the last about 10 days. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=41.46s)]
*  First of all, they isolated the battlefield [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=43.26s)]
*  by saying to everybody go south of Wadi Gaza, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=45.22s)]
*  which means they've cut Gaza in half, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=47.68s)]
*  and they're gonna focus on the northern half, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=49.5s)]
*  which they didn't do in 2014 when they went in full board [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=51.5s)]
*  into all of Gaza. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=54.739999999999995s)]
*  The second thing they're doing is they're using [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=55.980000000000004s)]
*  what we used to call thunder runs, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=57.94s)]
*  which is they're going in with a raid, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=59.3s)]
*  with an armored heavy raid, with bulldozers, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=60.66s)]
*  and going in and coming back out, setting the condition. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=63.059999999999995s)]
*  They're using heavy artillery now, heavy airstrikes, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=65.86s)]
*  to isolate the battlefield, and the next step is gonna be, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=68.75999999999999s)]
*  and this is your tell, is the ground assault [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=71.82s)]
*  is gonna take place, and it's gonna be a very tough assault, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=73.97999999999999s)]
*  but it's clear to me what they're doing. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=77.66s)]
*  Isolate the battlefield from Wadi Gaza north, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=79.46s)]
*  use maximum firepower to basically wear down the resistance, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=82.66s)]
*  and then put ground troops into Gaza, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=86.22000000000001s)]
*  and that is gonna be the tough fight. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=89.22000000000001s)]
*  That is the fight that is gonna take a lot of time, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=90.66000000000001s)]
*  a lot of effort, because you're fighting buildings, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=93.66000000000001s)]
*  two, three, four, five, six stories, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=97.26s)]
*  you're fighting ground level, you're fighting subterranean, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  meaning tunnels, which is a different fight entirely [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=101.66000000000001s)]
*  from a ground fight, and when you go into tunnels, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  it changes the dynamic totally. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=107.42000000000002s)]
*  One simple example, and you remember this. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=109.86000000000001s)]
*  Above ground, if you've got night vision goggles, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=112.78s)]
*  you use ambient light. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=114.7s)]
*  When you go into tunnels, you're in thermals, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=116.94s)]
*  meaning you have to see heat, which means you really [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=118.94s)]
*  don't know who your opponent is, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=120.86s)]
*  because all you're picking up is a symbol, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=122.94s)]
*  a red symbol of heat, so it's gonna be a tough fight, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=124.66s)]
*  but I will tell you, I think you're looking at the precursor [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=127.86s)]
*  of them going in full bore, probably within the next, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=130.42000000000002s)]
*  if not 48, 72 hours, and then the fight's really gonna [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=133.86s)]
*  get joined. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=136.98000000000002s)]
*  That is a big look ahead, a big prediction, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=137.82s)]
*  General Kellogg, what do you believe, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=141.06s)]
*  that they're expanding their operations, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=144.22s)]
*  that is the wording of the Israeli army tonight, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=145.86s)]
*  that they're expanding their operations right now, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=148.70000000000002s)]
*  what do you believe will be involved in their calculation [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=151.5s)]
*  when to move in for a full scale invasion? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=155.98000000000002s)]
*  I think the calculations would be sort of like, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=160.98000000000002s)]
*  okay, have we isolated the battlefield, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=162.70000000000002s)]
*  and you're gonna see forces move along Wadi Gaza, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=164.70000000000002s)]
*  which is like an old river bed, to isolate that from the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=167.38s)]
*  south to the north, and then you're gonna see the major [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=169.98000000000002s)]
*  forces come in to the north of Gaza, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=172.17999999999998s)]
*  and also into Gaza City itself, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=174.33999999999997s)]
*  and how they'll do this Sandra, is they'll basically, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=176.01999999999998s)]
*  think of a checkerboard, they're gonna isolate the city [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=178.82s)]
*  by checkerboards, and they'll go to each one of those, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=181.17999999999998s)]
*  and they probably have fairly decent intelligence [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=183.38s)]
*  of maybe where the hostages are held, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=186.73999999999998s)]
*  or where the command and control facilities are, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=188.7s)]
*  and they'll go block by block, building by building, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=190.66s)]
*  it won't be one of these major assaults, tank assaults, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=193.06s)]
*  that you used to see in the past, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=195.94s)]
*  this is an infantry specific fight, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=197.45999999999998s)]
*  it'll be a very hard fight, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=200.42s)]
*  but they're gonna do it very systematically. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=201.85999999999999s)]
*  You know, Gallant, their secretary of defense, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=203.7s)]
*  made the comment, this isn't gonna go over in a week, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=206.1s)]
*  or two weeks, the last time they went in 2014, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=208.06s)]
*  even though it was all of Gaza, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=211.7s)]
*  it lasted a little over a month, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=213.01999999999998s)]
*  I think they're going in for keeps on this time, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=214.46s)]
*  until they totally isolate, and reduce Hamas. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=216.46s)]
*  General, what do you make of the news that came out tonight, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=219.34s)]
*  that apparently internet service, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=221.34s)]
*  and cell phone communication is down, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=222.82s)]
*  I mean, to try to true tactic of war, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=224.5s)]
*  that the first thing you do when you're about to invade, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=226.82s)]
*  is you take away the enemy's eyes and ears. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=229.18s)]
*  You got it, and that's exactly what they're doing, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=232.62s)]
*  they're taking down the comms, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=234.72s)]
*  they're talking down the electricity, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=235.9s)]
*  the electrical grids, they're taking down everything they can, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=239.02s)]
*  to basically isolate that battlefield, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=242.14000000000001s)]
*  to give them the advantage, because right now John, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=244.1s)]
*  a lot of that advantage is gonna go to Hamas, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=247.26000000000002s)]
*  what I mean by that is, it's their, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=249.78s)]
*  basically they're fighting on their turf, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=251.9s)]
*  their battlefield, their tunnels, they set all this up, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=254.06s)]
*  so as good as the Israelis are, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=257.12s)]
*  and they've been training at a place called Zelem, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=259.12s)]
*  which is in the southern desert, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=261.28000000000003s)]
*  which is a massive military operations [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=262.7s)]
*  under urban training facility, and I've been there, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=265.4s)]
*  it's about 600 buildings, you can put a brigade in there, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=268.24s)]
*  they've been training up to that, going in there, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=271.04s)]
*  getting ready for it, but still the advantage [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=273.06s)]
*  goes to the defender, and they're gonna have to fight [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=275.24s)]
*  house to house, floor to floor, door to door, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=277.36s)]
*  it's not gonna be an easy fight, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=279.88s)]
*  I would caution everybody, you're gonna see some scenes [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=281.12s)]
*  come out of this, that are not gonna be pretty, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=283.8s)]
*  but that's the way war is, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=285.86s)]
*  and you're gonna see civilian casualties, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=287.46s)]
*  and you're gonna see a lot of damage brought into that area, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=289.38s)]
*  but that's the only way they can do it, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=292.78s)]
*  and frankly they've gotta reduce Hamas, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=294.21999999999997s)]
*  and this is the way they're gonna have to do it, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=296.46s)]
*  to take out the infrastructure, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=297.96s)]
*  take out the commanding officer. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=299.34s)]
*  And now we're wondering what that timeframe looks like [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=300.18s)]
*  to do that, General Kellogg, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=302.78s)]
*  the defense minister, Gallant, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=305.24s)]
*  many are looking at his comments, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=307.34s)]
*  basically pointing to a very long, potentially grueling [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=309.5s)]
*  and open-ended new phase of this war, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=312.5s)]
*  he told a group of foreign reporters that, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=315.22s)]
*  it will take a long time to dismantle Hamas' [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=318.14s)]
*  vast network of tunnels, that he expects a lengthy phase [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=321.42s)]
*  of lower intensity fighting, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=324.82s)]
*  as Israel destroys, pockets of resistance. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=327.02s)]
*  What sort of timeframe do you believe, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=331.02s)]
*  General, we're looking at here? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=333.14s)]
*  You know, you're talking, it's gonna go on for weeks, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=335.94s)]
*  30, 60 days, I will remind you, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=339.54s)]
*  in the back of my mind, I kept thinking about this, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=342.5s)]
*  what U.S. Grant did with Sherman in the Civil War, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=345.44s)]
*  when he went Sherman to the sea, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=347.64s)]
*  and they burned Atlanta to the ground. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=349.12s)]
*  And I remember what we did in World War II, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=351.08s)]
*  when we destroyed the city of Dresden, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=353.62s)]
*  just to send a signal. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=355.72s)]
*  I think you're looking at the total reduction, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=357.24s)]
*  if necessary, of the city of Gaza, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=359.66s)]
*  and that's the reason they told all the civilians, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=361.52s)]
*  move south of Wadi Gaza, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=363.8s)]
*  and because they're going in full strength. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=366.0s)]
*  Sandra, they've got to do this. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=368.84000000000003s)]
*  This, to them, is an existential fight. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=370.40000000000003s)]
*  Hamas did something that we haven't seen since World War II, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=373.28000000000003s)]
*  when the Nazis basically eliminated, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=377.76s)]
*  exterminated one third of the Jewish population. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=381.46000000000004s)]
*  This is what they're looking at as an existential fight. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=384.48s)]
*  And my recommendation to them, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=386.92s)]
*  they're not gonna take it, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=389.32s)]
*  but you have to go in hard, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=390.36s)]
*  and you're gonna have to reduce everything, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=392.16s)]
*  and don't leave until it's done. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=393.76s)]
*  That simple. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=396.68s)]
*  All right, General Keith Kellogg, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=398.24s)]
*  joining us from the AFPI offices. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iLJUxNVdk&t=399.92s)]
