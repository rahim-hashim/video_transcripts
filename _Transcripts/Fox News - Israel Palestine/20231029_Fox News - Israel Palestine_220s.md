# Israeli fighter jets 'roar' over Gaza
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4ZkGMQG7p0)
*  But we start with Trey Yanks. He's live in southern Israel. Trey. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4ZkGMQG7p0&t=0.0s)]
*  Arthel, good afternoon. You can hear Israeli jets overhead. They continue to strike targets along the Gaza Strip tonight. Israeli artillery units also active along the border. Earlier today we watched as the Israeli forces were operating inside the strip with tanks and APCs. Take a look. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4ZkGMQG7p0&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  As fighter jets roar overhead, you can see Israeli forces operating inside the Gaza Strip. The Israelis are working at this hour to soften their target from the ground and from the sky. The level of destruction inside Gaza is significant. The neighborhood behind me completely destroyed. You can see the mosques and buildings inside Gaza reduced to rubble. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4ZkGMQG7p0&t=24.12s)]

*  Though we do anticipate those forces to stay the night in Gaza as they continue to push deeper into the territory and destroy more tunnels with the air strikes that you see here. They've been pounding one specific location over and over again trying to destroy some of those tunnels with bunker buster bombs. New drone video today from inside Gaza shows the aftermath of those Israeli strikes. More than 450 of them over the past 24 hours. According to the Israeli military, you can see the activity is still going on. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4ZkGMQG7p0&t=71.12s)]

*  In terms of the situation along the border, the number of strikes and the artillery activity [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4ZkGMQG7p0&t=168.8s)]
*  is actually reduced tonight compared to the previous two nights. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4ZkGMQG7p0&t=174.20000000000002s)]

*  Hamas fighters, though we still understand that a group of militants came out of a tunnel [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4ZkGMQG7p0&t=182.92000000000002s)]
