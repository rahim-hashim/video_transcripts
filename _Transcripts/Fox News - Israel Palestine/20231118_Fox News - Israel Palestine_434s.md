# Dem rep reacts to ‘Squad’ members’ push for cease-fire: We should lead with ‘humanity’
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ)
*  Anita, Lucas, thank you for more on this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=0.0s)]
*  We're joined now by Democratic congresswoman from Pennsylvania and member of the House [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  Armed Services and Intelligence Committee's Chrissy Houlihan. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=6.16s)]
*  Congresswoman, thank you for joining us on a Saturday and weighing in. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=9.76s)]
*  We keep seeing these protests and I want to get to that and get your thoughts, but let's [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=13.64s)]
*  just dive into what Lucas was just reporting. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=18.32s)]
*  There's multiple letters, one of anonymous people in the administration condemning the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=21.56s)]
*  administration's actions, the other supporting. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=27.68s)]
*  What do you make of this? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  What do you make of the split, the divide, if you will? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=31.96s)]
*  So first of all, thank you very much for having me again. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=36.28s)]
*  It's a pleasure to be here. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=38.64s)]
*  And this is a really, really complicated situation. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=39.68s)]
*  And there are obviously quite diverse opinions on what we should be doing right now. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=42.28s)]
*  And it is the right of people to express their opinions, to articulate those in a safe and [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=47.28s)]
*  peaceful manner. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=52.32s)]
*  It is also the right of people within the government to do the same. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=53.44s)]
*  That being said, I do agree with the prior commentary that you were voicing, which is we serve, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=57.24s)]
*  all of us serve, well, many people within the government serve at the pleasure of the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=61.92s)]
*  president. And if for whatever reason they are not on board with what it is that the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=65.52000000000001s)]
*  president is doing, they have options. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=69.68s)]
*  And I think that it should be their responsibility to make sure that they are aligned with [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=72.4s)]
*  what it is that the administration is trying to do with a fair amount of pushback, but [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=77.0s)]
*  that they make sure that they understand that we all are under one commander in chief. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=81.32000000000001s)]
*  Congresswoman, are you concerned about these growing protests? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=86.76s)]
*  We had the one large one on the mall. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=90.60000000000001s)]
*  I covered it. That was pro-Israel. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=92.92s)]
*  But most of them appear to be pro-Palestinian. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=95.16000000000001s)]
*  In fact, I was covering the one that got violent out front of the DNC. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=97.48s)]
*  I spoke to one of the protesters that was late Wednesday night outside the DNC where [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=102.2s)]
*  it got violent. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=108.44s)]
*  And I asked her specifically about why they're doing this. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=109.72s)]
*  And she basically said that so many Democrats are out of touch with the party's [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=113.75999999999999s)]
*  wishes. Listen here, I want to play it for you and get your reaction. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=119.52s)]
*  We've called our congresspeople. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=123.84s)]
*  We have come to their offices as constituents and we've tried to ask them to do what 80 [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  percent of their base is asking for and call for a ceasefire. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=131.07999999999998s)]
*  They're not listening. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=134.48s)]
*  Does 80 percent of the Democratic base support a ceasefire, in your opinion? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=136.72s)]
*  I don't believe that that is the case, to be really honest. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=141.72s)]
*  When we're in our offices, we certainly are used to having constituents reach out to [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=144.48s)]
*  us and we appreciate that with their opinions. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=149.23999999999998s)]
*  Usually the opinions go one way or the other. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=151.48s)]
*  People don't usually call you when they're happy with what it is that you're doing. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=154.67999999999998s)]
*  So it's really hard for us to ascertain what the percentage is. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=157.95999999999998s)]
*  Importantly, I serve all of the people in my district. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=161.67999999999998s)]
*  I serve in a district that's 40 percent Democrat, 40 percent Republican and 20 percent [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=164.23999999999998s)]
*  independent. And so I'm not sure that that's the case. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=168.83999999999997s)]
*  So it's my responsibility to listen to all of the people within my district and try to [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=171.2s)]
*  do the best I can to articulate that opinion and that those ideas to Washington and to [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=175.44s)]
*  the leadership. But also, just as importantly, it's my responsibility to lead in reverse [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=181.04s)]
*  as well, to tell people what I'm learning, what I know about what's going on, and to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=185.67999999999998s)]
*  help inform and educate them about what's going on in the global and in the global [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=189.48s)]
*  environment so that we can all be hopefully as unified as possible during this really [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=194.28s)]
*  very difficult time. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=198.0s)]
*  And based on what you do know, are you calling for a ceasefire? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=199.56s)]
*  No, at this point in time, very importantly, it is very much the responsibility of [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=203.4s)]
*  Israel to protect and defend its sovereignty. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=209.52s)]
*  It is also the responsibility of Israel to make sure that they're doing that under the [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=212.68s)]
*  laws of war. I have certainly called for that. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=216.8s)]
*  I have also called for strategic pauses and humanitarian pauses, and I believe that's [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=219.8s)]
*  appropriate. But we also want to make sure that we are understanding that Hamas is a [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=225.12s)]
*  very vile and violent terrorist organization that absolutely needs to be taken out of [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=229.48000000000002s)]
*  power in the Gaza area. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=234.96s)]
*  And so I believe that that can be done, should be done, but I also know that it needs [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=237.48000000000002s)]
*  very much to be done with respect to the internationally established law of war. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=242.72s)]
*  Some of your colleagues, notably those in the so-called squad, Rashida Tlaib, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=248.0s)]
*  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilan Omar have really been constantly and frequently [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=253.24s)]
*  engaging in anti-Israel rhetoric, so much so Politico now reporting that the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=260.64s)]
*  progressive Democrats like the squad have gone to your minority leader, Jeffries, in [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=267.0s)]
*  asking for some help encountering AIPAC, Israel's the largest Israeli lobby in the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=272.68s)]
*  U.S. that's trying to get pro-Israel Democrats in there in the primary to challenge [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=279.16s)]
*  them. What do you make of that? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=284.04s)]
*  So it's really important that when we're having these conversations that people like us [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=286.16s)]
*  who are in positions like ours, members of Congress, lead with humanity, with [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=290.24s)]
*  civility and decency, and we lead with the interest of trying to unify our communities. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=295.12s)]
*  And so I think it's important that when I listen to rhetoric from either side going [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=300.24s)]
*  that I ask questions, that I seek unity and harmony. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=305.92s)]
*  And I understand that Rashida and Ilhan and those folks have a very different life [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=309.64s)]
*  experience than I do and that many in my community do. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=316.08s)]
*  And so I'd like to ask them questions about this in the same way that I ask faith [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=319.48s)]
*  leaders in my own community about what's going on and try to figure out a way to keep [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=322.96s)]
*  people together. Thankfully, in my community, we have been continuing to try to speak [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=326.92s)]
*  across the faiths. And I think that's very, very important because if we don't have [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=331.64s)]
*  civil and decent conversations, then it's hopeless. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=335.72s)]
*  I think that that's what's important right now. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=340.28000000000003s)]
*  Very evil forces, frankly, are trying to divide us. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=342.44000000000005s)]
*  Very, very evil forces. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=345.72s)]
*  And we need to be listening to each other. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=347.32000000000005s)]
*  Congresswoman, I just want to point out for our viewers you're seeing on your screen [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=349.32000000000005s)]
*  here, those are live rockets in Gaza. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=352.6s)]
*  And just in the last 20 seconds or so I've got here, let me just ask you one final [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=355.24s)]
*  question. That is, you talk about unity as we watch rockets over Gaza and you have a [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=359.0s)]
*  very big division with progressives in your party. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=364.48s)]
*  Do Democrats have a problem in the House come next November over this issue? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=367.8s)]
*  I think that Democrats have demonstrated their humanity, their civility and their [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=374.68s)]
*  decency. And I think that this is a complicated issue. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=379.12s)]
*  And there are many, many people who there's more than enough sorrow going around right [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=381.96000000000004s)]
*  now. What we are trying to do is make sure that the hostages are freed. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=386.28000000000003s)]
*  We're trying to make sure that the Palestinian people are are safe, that the Israeli [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=389.72s)]
*  people are safe as well. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=394.16s)]
*  And those are not, I think, complex issues. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=395.8s)]
*  I think those are the values of the Democratic Party. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=397.84000000000003s)]
*  Congresswoman Christy Houlihan, thank you very much for taking time as we continue to [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=401.0s)]
*  look at flares and rockets and all sorts of activity continues 43 days into this [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=405.84000000000003s)]
*  war in Israel. Congresswoman, thank you very much. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=411.56s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=414.20000000000005s)]
*  Anita? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFODJngfFBQ&t=415.52000000000004s)]
