# 'COMBATTING ANTISEMITISM': Kenneth Marcus warns this is unlike anything we've seen in America
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g)
*  Welcome back America. We have with us Kenneth Marcus, former Assistant Secretary [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=0.0s)]
*  of Education for Civil Rights under Donald Trump. He founded and is chairman [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=7.0s)]
*  of the Brandeis Center, civil rights lawyer as well, and he's written a book [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=11.92s)]
*  the definition of anti-Semitism. Kenneth Marcus, you see what's happening in our [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=16.92s)]
*  colleges and universities. I've never seen anything like this before in my [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=21.68s)]
*  life. Nobody else has either. You see it pouring out into the streets. As the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=25.16s)]
*  former Assistant Secretary of Education for Civil Rights, I'd like your view on [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=30.52s)]
*  this and what it can be done if we have an administration and a Department of [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=34.68s)]
*  Education that wants to do something about it. Sure, I have been working on [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=40.24s)]
*  this issue for over 20 years and I have to tell you that what we're seeing this [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=44.16s)]
*  year and over the last four weeks on college campuses is unlike anything that [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=47.92s)]
*  we have seen in the United States. It's unlike anything going all the way back. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=53.599999999999994s)]
*  When Hamas committed its murders, its rape, its tortures, its atrocity, it was [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=57.36s)]
*  met with extraordinary celebration on many many colleges and campuses not just [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=64.0s)]
*  by students who are coming out en masse to celebrate this murder, this inhumanity, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=69.64s)]
*  but also assaulting Jewish students, forcing them to be locked in a library, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=76.64s)]
*  threatening them with death, things that we have never seen before. We have [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=83.28s)]
*  campuses that can deal with the tiniest of microaggressions, real or perceived, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=87.44s)]
*  but when there are actual macroaggressions, they're not dealing with [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=92.32s)]
*  it. These universities are all getting federal funds and the U.S. Department of [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=96.92s)]
*  Education's Office for Civil Rights, which I formerly led during the Trump [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=101.4s)]
*  administration, has an obligation to make sure that taxpayer money is not being [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=104.8s)]
*  used to subsidize this sort of gross anti-Semitism. They can do more. They can [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=108.36s)]
*  investigate not the speech but the conduct and they can make sure that those [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=113.28s)]
*  who are assaulting, harassing, excluding, marginalizing Jewish students are treated [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=117.28s)]
*  the same way as those who are doing the same for any other group. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=124.04s)]
*  What about this funding issue? Universities and colleges, I believe they [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=126.88s)]
*  get significant federal funds, whether it's grants or student loans or this sort [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=131.24s)]
*  of thing. Is there anything the Department of Education, or for that matter, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=135.12s)]
*  the Department of Justice, can do to try and force proper behavior in these [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=139.8s)]
*  radicalized universities and colleges? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=144.6s)]
*  That is the whole purpose for why we have an agency called OCR. That's the agency [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=147.08s)]
*  that I formerly ran and its sole obligation is to make sure that federal [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=151.76s)]
*  funds are not used to support discriminatory behavior. It does this on a [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=157.32s)]
*  whole host of other issues. It needs to do it with anti-Semitism. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=163.0s)]
*  Now, we at the Brandeis Center are filing complaints and the Biden administration [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=167.20000000000002s)]
*  says it's waiting for complaints. But the fact is they don't have to wait. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=172.32s)]
*  The Secretary of Education has full authority to conduct self-directed [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=175.72s)]
*  investigations on his own any time he turns on the television or opens a [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=180.32s)]
*  newspaper and sees what's going on. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  And if he turns on the TV at all or reads the newspaper, then he's got to know [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=187.16s)]
*  that his education department funds are going to support these activities and it [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=192.48s)]
*  has to stop. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, I saw a brief, almost passing statement by him in which he says they're [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=198.56s)]
*  going to really start to look into this and so forth. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=203.84s)]
*  I guess what bothers me is they're only going to start to look into this. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=206.92s)]
*  I mean, you were at the Department of Education. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=210.64s)]
*  There was, I believe it was an executive order that was signed by President Trump. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=214.0s)]
*  I believe you were one of the main authors of that executive order. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=218.2s)]
*  So you saw this coming. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=222.72s)]
*  President Trump saw this coming. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=225.2s)]
*  You began to try and do something about it before Joe Biden took over. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=227.44s)]
*  What did the Biden administration do with this executive order or this document or [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=234.56s)]
*  this this regulation that was intended to address, to some extent, anti-Semitism on [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=239.56s)]
*  our campuses? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=244.48s)]
*  Well, I'm glad you mentioned that because it's both important and timely. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=245.44s)]
*  The Biden administration claims that they have not rescinded the Trump executive order [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=249.20000000000002s)]
*  on combating anti-Semitism, even though they've rescinded many of President Trump's [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=253.4s)]
*  other orders. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=257.36s)]
*  They say it's still in force in effect, but there's no indication that they're really [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=258.44s)]
*  using it the way it needs to be used. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=262.56s)]
*  They have promised the White House has promised through the unified agenda that it [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=264.4s)]
*  will issue regulations that will codify and extend President Trump's executive order [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=268.68s)]
*  on combating anti-Semitism. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=273.56s)]
*  But it has now twice delayed these regulations that it has promised. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=275.64000000000004s)]
*  Currently, their self-imposed extended deadline is December of this year. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=280.72s)]
*  That's just next month. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=285.12s)]
*  But they're not talking about it. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=286.68s)]
*  There's no mention of it in the recent OCR report to Congress. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=288.24s)]
*  There's no mention of it in the national strategy on anti-Semitism. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  And yet it's supposed to be here next month. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=294.88s)]
*  I think we should be asking, where is this where is this NPRM, this notice that has [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=296.88s)]
*  been promised over and over again? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=302.08000000000004s)]
*  We need to see some action from the Education Department. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=304.52s)]
*  What exactly did this executive order do that President Trump signed? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=307.11999999999995s)]
*  I don't believe any president has ever signed an executive order like this in [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=311.2s)]
*  combating anti-Semitism. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=314.88s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=316.4s)]
*  Nobody's ever done anything like that. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=317.59999999999997s)]
*  We did see a significant policy advance under President George W. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=319.35999999999996s)]
*  Bush. We actually saw some good action under President Obama. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=322.59999999999997s)]
*  With President Trump, we saw something unprecedented. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=327.55999999999995s)]
*  With President Biden, we've seen some good words, but not yet real action. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=330.32000000000005s)]
*  The executive order on combating anti-Semitism signed by President Trump was a [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=335.0s)]
*  game changer. It made very clear that Jews, Jewish students are protected under [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=339.16s)]
*  Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=345.16s)]
*  That was important. It had been informally understood since a guidance letter that I [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=347.76000000000005s)]
*  had issued in 2004. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=352.72s)]
*  But this was the first time it was elevated to the level of an executive order. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=353.96000000000004s)]
*  More importantly, President Trump directed OCR and other agencies to use an important [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=357.84000000000003s)]
*  definition, the so-called IRA working definition, in all applicable cases. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=364.84000000000003s)]
*  Now, you might think that a particular definition can't do very much, but it does [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=369.48s)]
*  make clear that not every criticism of Israel is anti-Semitic, but some activity, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=373.48s)]
*  some conduct against Jews relating to Israel. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=379.08000000000004s)]
*  And we're seeing Jews being beaten up, followed, harassed, et cetera. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=382.92s)]
*  Some of it is anti-Semitic and it provides very specific standards for dealing with [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=386.04s)]
*  it. Without those standards, without that tool, OCR seems to be rudderless. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=390.6s)]
*  They really do need to take the Trump executive order and turn it into something more [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=395.6s)]
*  durable, a regulation that simply says what President Donald Trump said. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opW6ivKZV6g&t=400.44s)]
