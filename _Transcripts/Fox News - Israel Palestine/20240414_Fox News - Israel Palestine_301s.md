# Iran made a 'big mistake': Israeli Special Ops vet
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q)
*  For more on this, let's bring in Aaron Cohen. He is an Israeli special operations veteran. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=0.0s)]
*  So the drones are on their way from Iran. Apparently, some have already been engaged, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  possibly or maybe probably shot down. We don't know of anything striking Israeli territory [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  yet. Just give us your assessment of this very brazen attack by Iran. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=18.78s)]
*  Well, John, my immediate instinctual response as Iran has officially declared war on Israel, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=25.48s)]
*  I can tell you that's a big mistake. Israel not only has a lot of warming up in the last six [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  months in recent operations in Gaza, very intense fighting there, very intense air campaign. Israel [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=38.04s)]
*  has eradicated almost 15,000 terrorists within six months. The IDF is highly motivated. They took a [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=46.44s)]
*  little what we call schnaz or combat rest pulling out of Gaza. If I had to venture to guess right [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=52.32s)]
*  now, I would say that Israel's got several special operations assets that are in Iran at this time [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=59.2s)]
*  right now, John. And what they're doing is they're looking, they're creeping, they're snooping. That's [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=65.36s)]
*  what these intelligence commando style units do, Sheldag, Maglan. And Israel actually lives, John, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=70.36s)]
*  is two major pieces for the Israeli survival. First thing is that actionable intelligence. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=79.44s)]
*  So Israel right now is having a good look. They've got a multi-layered air defense system [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=84.84s)]
*  between the Spyder, the Barak system, obviously the Iron Dome, which we've seen as the all-stars [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=91.08s)]
*  of the last Gaza campaign, also in southern Lebanon, the attacks coming from Hezbollah. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=96.52s)]
*  I think at this point Israel's had enough, and I wouldn't be surprised if Israel full out initiates [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=102.8s)]
*  some type of preemptive response that will directly attack those missile batteries and those drone [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=109.36s)]
*  launch points, which if I had to venture are coming out of the southwestern region of Iran. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=117.91999999999999s)]
*  Again, Iran made a big mistake. Israel has a ton of intelligence on Iran. And to the Iranian leaders, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=124.44s)]
*  I say behet atz rosi dorim, like they say in Farsi, which is not only is Suleimani within our reach, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=132.67999999999998s)]
*  but every one of these military leaders is within Israel's reach. Every one of those missile and [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=139.04s)]
*  drone launch points could potentially get obliterated in due time. And Israel will move [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  when it feels it needs to and when it feels it's ready. They need to be careful because we've got [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=151.16s)]
*  multiple attackers about to square up on Israel. But John, it's not Israel's first rodeo. We saw [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=157.64s)]
*  it in 67, Syria, Egypt, Lebanon. Also had over 50 Scud missiles coming from Iraq at the beginning [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=164.23999999999998s)]
*  of the Gulf War. Israel's got a lot of experience in dealing with attacks from multiple countries, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  and this is just going to be another dust-up with Iran. I think Israel's going to put Iran [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=176.6s)]
*  in its place very soon, if I had to guess. We have just about a minute left, but you don't [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=182.23999999999998s)]
*  think then that Israel is in any way overwhelmed or overmatched. The feeling is that maybe the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=186.6s)]
*  Iranians thought that Israel has been weakened perhaps by the attacks from its proxies. You [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  don't think that's the case at all. No, John, I remember having conversations with the media [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=200.44s)]
*  on October 8th and everybody thought Israel was going to get wiped off the map. John, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=204.4s)]
*  didn't happen in 48, didn't happen in 56 in the Mitla Pass, didn't happen in 67, didn't happen [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=207.56s)]
*  in 73. And after 20 years of fighting in the southern border of Lebanon, Israel still didn't [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=213.4s)]
*  get wiped off the map. After that attack on October 7th, which killed 1,200 civilians, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=217.72s)]
*  beheaded babies, raped women, kidnapped 150-plus hostages, we're still in those tunnels. Israel's [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=222.08s)]
*  still around. Israel is an incredibly well-oiled and intelligent machine that focuses on actionable [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=228.96s)]
*  intelligence. Their Mossad is one of the finest institutions in the world. Regardless of the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=235.20000000000002s)]
*  mistake that was made on October 7th, Goldermeyer said it best, we can't protect every inch of the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=240.08s)]
*  fence. Mistakes are going to happen. But Iran's posturing. They're making a mistake. The fact is [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=244.64000000000001s)]
*  the Iranian people, like your last guest, the general said, the Iranian people don't support [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=251.04000000000002s)]
*  the regime. And at the end of the day, everyone is very much in line in the region to see this [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=255.32000000000002s)]
*  Islamic regime get toppled. And if Israel is going to be the one to do it, then so be it. But Israel [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=262.28000000000003s)]
*  is not in harm's way. There will be repercussions. Projectiles will fall into Israel. But Israelis, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=267.0s)]
*  it's a warrior culture. Israel's going to be fine. And it's time for Israel to put on their war face [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=273.12s)]
*  again and get into a tactical mode, which is what they're doing. Aaron Cohen, a veteran of the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=278.36s)]
*  Israeli Special Operations Forces. Thank you. Thank you, John. Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMTs1S5aK5Q&t=284.6s)]
