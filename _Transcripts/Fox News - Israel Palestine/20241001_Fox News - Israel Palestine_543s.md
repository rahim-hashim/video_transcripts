# Iran reportedly moving missiles for attack on Israel
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y)
*  Well, this is right now what it looks like in Beirut, Lebanon, where Israel is continuing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=0.0s)]
*  to pound that area. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=8.36s)]
*  We just saw live images of the aftermath of an Israeli airstrike continuing to take out [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=10.8s)]
*  Hezbollah terror targets. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=16.52s)]
*  Tensions are reaching, well, the point of retaliation now in the Middle East. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=19.76s)]
*  This is what we were wanting to avoid. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=25.060000000000002s)]
*  A senior White House official tells Fox Iran is planning an imminent missile attack on [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=27.52s)]
*  Israel. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=32.92s)]
*  The Israeli Defense Force pushing forward with a new phase now in its war on Hezbollah. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=34.4s)]
*  Yesterday, of course, it moved in on the ground, the IDF, and called it limited ground operations [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=39.24s)]
*  inside southern Lebanon, going after Iran's proxy terrorists, those people they prop up [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=45.42s)]
*  with their money. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=51.44s)]
*  Hezbollah plan to launch their October 7 attack from villages across southern Lebanon, where [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=52.44s)]
*  they have been building up their arms capabilities and forces for the last two decades. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=62.519999999999996s)]
*  Our soldiers entered Hezbollah's underground infrastructures, exposed Hezbollah's hidden [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=69.24s)]
*  weapon caches, and seized and destroyed the weapons, including advanced Iranian-made weapons. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=75.3s)]
*  Israeli airstrikes have taken out nearly all of Hezbollah's command in recent weeks, including [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=84.38s)]
*  their big leader Nasrallah just this week. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=89.86s)]
*  Hassan Nasrallah was hit inside the nation's capital, precision by Israel. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=93.58s)]
*  Nate Foy is in Tel Aviv. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=100.06s)]
*  Nate, before you take it away, I have a quick question. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=101.62s)]
*  In terms of this eminence, can you see or do you know what's happening on the other [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=104.7s)]
*  side of the border in Lebanon at this point? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=108.8s)]
*  Does it look like people are moving out of the way there, too? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=111.53999999999999s)]
*  I'm just curious to know, because that will tell us potentially how fast Iran is going [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=113.62s)]
*  to hit Israel. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=118.22s)]
*  Well, the ground incursion, as you know, Harris, is underway, but I can actually tell you an [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=120.02s)]
*  exact number. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=125.96s)]
*  It takes 12 minutes for a ballistic missile to travel from Iran to where we are in Israel [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=127.22s)]
*  right now. So it's a waiting game. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=134.01999999999998s)]
*  And as you mentioned, according to a U.S. official, Iran has been noticed moving its [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=135.45999999999998s)]
*  missiles in recent days, and we're expecting this attack to play out in the next 24 hours. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=141.26s)]
*  What we don't know, Harris, is the exact scale of it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=148.06s)]
*  The only reference point that we have is the only direct attack on Israel that Iran has [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=151.26s)]
*  launched, which they did back in April after Israel attacked an Iranian consulate in Damascus. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=156.01999999999998s)]
*  In that attack, Iran launched over 300 ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and drones. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=162.42s)]
*  But as you mentioned in your intro, this time it's different, because just days ago Israel [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=168.5s)]
*  took out Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, for 32 years. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=173.2s)]
*  And just hours ago, Israel launched a ground offensive into Lebanon, threatening one of [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=177.78s)]
*  Iran's biggest proxies. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=183.82s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had this message for the people of Israel moments ago. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=186.34s)]
*  Together we will stand steadfast in the trying days ahead of us. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=192.38s)]
*  Together we will stand. Together we will fight. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=197.98s)]
*  And together we will win. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=200.74s)]
*  And take a look at this, Harris. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=204.46s)]
*  Tel Aviv got hit by Hezbollah rockets this morning. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=205.66s)]
*  They targeted the Mossad headquarters here. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=208.4s)]
*  The IDF says two drivers got hurt by falling shrapnel. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=210.96s)]
*  And we're also learning today that Israeli special units infiltrated southern Lebanon [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=214.57999999999998s)]
*  dozens of times throughout the conflict before launching its limited offensive last night. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=219.06s)]
*  The IDF identified and dismantled the tunnel network, gathered intelligence and hampered [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=224.38s)]
*  Hezbollah's capabilities during covert operations. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=229.3s)]
*  Right now, as we anticipate this pending attack, Harris, there are thousands of additional [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=233.0s)]
*  U.S. troops in the region, including fighter jet squadrons, that will defend Israel from [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=238.86s)]
*  this attack. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=245.5s)]
*  The U.S. also says that if Iran directly attacks Israel, there will be severe consequences [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=246.5s)]
*  for Iran. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=252.46s)]
*  We'll send it back to you. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=253.46s)]
*  There is so much going on every time I see a report with you. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=254.46s)]
*  Thank you, Nate Foy, for getting the conversation started on this. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=257.5s)]
*  You got it. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=260.62s)]
*  Florida Congressman Brian Mass now. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=261.62s)]
*  Let's dig into what was just reported. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=262.94s)]
*  The congressman served as a volunteer in the Israeli Defense Forces, and he sits on the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=264.98s)]
*  House Foreign Affairs Committee, and he served for our nation valiantly as well, too. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=268.9s)]
*  It is great to see you today. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=273.18s)]
*  Let's dig in. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=274.58s)]
*  I asked the question about what it looks like on the Lebanese-Israeli border. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=275.85999999999996s)]
*  And the reason I asked that question is, if you know that there's a ground incursion coming, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=280.21999999999997s)]
*  you'll move some people out of the way. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=284.34s)]
*  I get that. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=285.53999999999996s)]
*  But if you know Iran is going to then come from another direction and join that, you'll [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=286.53999999999996s)]
*  move everybody. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=291.14s)]
*  Is that even a potential? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=292.5s)]
*  I mean, would Iran do more than just hit Israel by air? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=293.74s)]
*  Look, I think what Iran has to assess in the response that they get is probably twofold. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=298.21999999999997s)]
*  One, has Israel totally degraded their ability to do a short-range attack by what they did [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=304.34000000000003s)]
*  on that Lebanon border? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=309.90000000000003s)]
*  Have they eliminated those capabilities of rockets, of drones, of things in the short [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=311.06s)]
*  way? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=315.38s)]
*  And so are they left with only the option of doing something from a longer range? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=316.38s)]
*  And then they have to assess. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=320.14s)]
*  Because remember, they're not dealing exactly with U.S. military-grade equipment in the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=321.62s)]
*  same generation that we talk about, our generations of equipment. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=325.90000000000003s)]
*  They're not in the same ballpark. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=330.26s)]
*  They're not in the same game. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=331.26s)]
*  So what can they do against the other systems of defense that are there beyond the Iron [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=332.3s)]
*  Dome system that gets spoken about so much? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=336.7s)]
*  The Aero system, the tactical high-altitude area defense systems, the David Sling systems, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=339.02000000000004s)]
*  these other systems. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=345.1s)]
*  What do they think they can do against other systems of defense? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=346.3s)]
*  And that's something that they have to calculate. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=348.86s)]
*  So you were part of the IDF. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=351.3s)]
*  And I know viewers may wonder, well, how did that come about? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=354.38s)]
*  And what can you tell us about those fighting forces? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=357.14s)]
*  This goes back to what was going on in higher education years ago. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=361.5s)]
*  I was a student at Harvard back in 2014. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=364.3s)]
*  There were constant protests against Israel at that time. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=367.34s)]
*  And I decided one day, after having a very negative encounter with some Palestinian supporters, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=370.62s)]
*  that I was going to go and show my support for Israel. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=375.74s)]
*  And I did. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=377.74s)]
*  I went and volunteered alongside their military there, which was a great experience. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=378.74s)]
*  But what I can tell you about the difference in those forces is they realize on a daily [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=382.26s)]
*  basis that they are surrounded by enemies directly on their border, whether it be the [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=386.34s)]
*  tunnels that come through Egypt, whether it be what comes across from Gaza or whether [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=390.58000000000004s)]
*  it be what comes from the north in Lebanon. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=394.3s)]
*  They have a daily reminder of the enemy is on their border. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=396.70000000000005s)]
*  And it's just a matter of maybe 40, 50 miles for them to cut the country in half in many [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=401.26000000000005s)]
*  of these places. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=406.62s)]
*  That's the reality for the fighters on the ground. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=407.68s)]
*  Congressman Maas, do you believe that there was any sort of coordination between Hezbollah [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=409.58000000000004s)]
*  and Hamas on October 7th? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=414.14000000000004s)]
*  Hezbollah began to hit Israel very hard with more missiles on October 8th after that seventh [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=416.7s)]
*  attack. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=423.78000000000003s)]
*  Do you think there was any coordination between those two groups? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=424.78000000000003s)]
*  I absolutely believe that there was coordination and that Israel was wise to not take the bait. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=427.54s)]
*  Israel has been bombarded by Hezbollah for the last year, moving people out of the north [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=432.38s)]
*  of Israel because so many people have been attacked, many refugees, I guess you could [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=437.26s)]
*  call them at this point. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=441.46s)]
*  They wanted to focus on what was going on in Gaza. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=442.72s)]
*  They are now moving on to addressing what has been taking place for this last year, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=445.26s)]
*  coming from the Lebanon border, coming into Israel. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=449.58s)]
*  And this had to happen. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=451.94s)]
*  And in this, I think everybody needs to ask themselves a question as they ask, well, is [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=453.65999999999997s)]
*  this going to escalate? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=457.38s)]
*  Is this going to lead to something bigger? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=458.38s)]
*  If this was the United States of America and Canada were lobbing rockets into Michigan [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=460.46s)]
*  or the cartels on the southern border were lobbing them into California or Arizona or [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=465.34s)]
*  someone else, none of us would be asking if it's going to escalate. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=469.14s)]
*  We would only be asking what capabilities we need to destroy that enemy. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=473.22s)]
*  Well the cartels are an enemy and they don't use bombs. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=478.02000000000004s)]
*  They use fentanyl and sex trafficking and attacking women and children. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=480.78000000000003s)]
*  They're cowards. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=485.34000000000003s)]
*  So yeah, I guess that's our first war down there. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=486.34000000000003s)]
*  Last quick question. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=489.54s)]
*  What type of movement now are you looking at to say what Iran is going to do next? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=491.26000000000005s)]
*  I think for them, are they moving any forces that they have remaining off of the border [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=497.18s)]
*  again, recognizing the difference in generations of weaponry that they have. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=501.78s)]
*  Israel has to look at, okay, did they only have capability to fire something that they [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=507.29999999999995s)]
*  had eyes on or lasers on? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=511.82s)]
*  Or again, this is going into details of different generations of technology, but those have [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=514.02s)]
*  to be things that Israel are looking for. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=518.4599999999999s)]
*  Congressman Massoud, it's always great to have you in focus. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y&t=520.86s)]
