# Netanyahu on Hamas hostage deal: Hopefully good news 'soon'
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs)
*  An agreement could be announced at any moment, but here's what we know at this hour about [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=0.0s)]
*  the hostages. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=4.88s)]
*  The deal on the table would free about 50 Israeli women and children in exchange for [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=6.22s)]
*  150 Palestinian prisoners. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=11.88s)]
*  And more could be released if fighting in Gaza is paused for several days. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=14.88s)]
*  But some military officials warn any agreement could give Hamas crucial days to regroup and [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=19.18s)]
*  launch a counteroffensive on Israeli troops. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=23.68s)]
*  We have great coverage now. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=27.6s)]
*  The former Israeli ambassador to the United States, Michael Oren, just moments away with [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=28.6s)]
*  his takeaway from the negotiations. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=33.08s)]
*  But first to our Trey Yankst. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=35.4s)]
*  He is live on the ground in southern Israel. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=36.92s)]
*  And Trey, what are you hearing from your sources on this possible deal? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=38.800000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  Hey, John. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  Good afternoon. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  We understand that Israel's war cabinet just wrapped up a meeting. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=46.88s)]
*  Shortly the security cabinet will have another meeting and then the entire government expected [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  to meet later to vote on this proposed ceasefire and hostage deal that could see dozens of [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=54.96s)]
*  Israeli civilians, mostly women and children, headed back to Israel in exchange for Palestinian [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=60.96s)]
*  prisoners. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=66.36s)]
*  These conversations have been taking place at a very high level over the past several [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=67.36s)]
*  weeks. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  The Qataris helping to negotiate this along with the Americans trying to get a ceasefire [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  together for anywhere from four to five days with the possibility of an extension. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=76.16s)]
*  Now, this will be staggered. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=80.68s)]
*  The initial group is expected to be anywhere from 10 to 12 hostages released into Israeli [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=82.4s)]
*  custody after this 24 hour waiting period that is expected to allow the political and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=87.08000000000001s)]
*  government process to play out in Israel before the deal moves forward. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=92.76s)]
*  I do want you to listen to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who spoke earlier today [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=96.44000000000001s)]
*  about the possibility of a ceasefire and Israel's goals. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  The first goal, eliminating Hamas. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=106.48s)]
*  We will not stop until we are done. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=109.08000000000001s)]
*  The second goal, bringing the hostages back. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=111.76s)]
*  We are making progress. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  I don't think we need to discuss it further, not even at this moment. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  But I hope we will have good news soon. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  At this moment you can hear the buzz of an Israeli drone overhead. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=124.48s)]
*  The Israelis are still surveilling the Gaza Strip, but as part of this agreement there [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=127.75999999999999s)]
*  are reports that indicate Israel will reduce that surveillance as something that Hamas [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=132.44s)]
*  requested. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=137.76s)]
*  We do understand as the agreement goes into place, more fuel and aid will still enter [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=139.08s)]
*  the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=144.28s)]
*  At this moment you can see some of the aftermath video from Gaza's second largest city of [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=145.64000000000001s)]
*  Hanunis. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=150.36s)]
*  There are still more than two million Palestinians inside Gaza in desperate need of medical assistance, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=151.36s)]
*  food and water. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=156.16000000000003s)]
*  The Israelis continue to say their enemy in Gaza is not the civilian population, but rather [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=157.52s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=162.32000000000002s)]
*  And even if this deal does move forward, we will see a pause in fighting. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=163.32000000000002s)]
*  As the Israelis tell Fox News this afternoon, they will continue to go after Hamas' leadership [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=167.22s)]
*  when that deal is complete. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=171.78s)]
*  John? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=173.3s)]
*  Yeah, that was one of the questions I had, is what happens after the ceasefire is over. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=174.3s)]
*  The other question I had, Trey, is what is Hamas expected to do during this ceasefire? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=177.9s)]
*  Because the fears from Israel have been that any ceasefire would only play into their hands, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=184.96s)]
*  allowing them to regroup, rearm, and get ready for any onslaught that might come after a [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=190.06s)]
*  ceasefire. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=196.02s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=197.02s)]
*  There are huge questions right now about what happens the day after a ceasefire. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=200.12s)]
*  Now, Israeli officials told us today the fighting will continue. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=204.46s)]
*  They will continue to go after Hamas' leadership, not just in the northern part of Gaza, but [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=207.9s)]
*  also the central and the southern part of Gaza. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=212.14s)]
*  We're talking about two major population centers, Hanunis and Ra'afah, these southern cities. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=214.98s)]
*  But the Israelis have told all of the Palestinians to head south. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=219.84s)]
*  So it raises questions about how they're going to operate in this area, with a firm [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=223.18s)]
*  understanding that most of the leadership from Hamas is no longer in the northern part [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=226.94s)]
*  of the Gaza Strip. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=231.06s)]
*  They have moved south. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=232.22s)]
*  They are in the tunnel network beneath Gaza. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=233.22s)]
*  And even if they do release women and children, remember, they still have Israeli civilian [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=235.36s)]
*  men that are being held captive, hostage inside Gaza, and the soldiers that are taking dozens [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=239.62s)]
*  of them, from what we understand, not even on the table as part of this agreement. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=245.48000000000002s)]
*  John? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=249.34s)]
*  We're getting closer than we've been, John Kirby says. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=250.38s)]
*  We believe we're getting closer. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=252.98s)]
*  This obviously after the president, as we've been reporting, says he feels optimistic. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=254.74s)]
*  But nothing is done until it's done. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=259.1s)]
*  And John Kirby in his comments talking about he doesn't want to say anything in these delicate [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=262.18s)]
*  hours that could put this deal at greater risk. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=266.5s)]
*  Trey, we're left wondering just how much time before we learn that this is indeed happening [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=269.42s)]
*  and those hostages actually get transferred. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=275.18s)]
*  So the announcement could come in a matter of hours following the government meeting [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=280.73999999999995s)]
*  and Israel and the approval of such a deal. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=284.17999999999995s)]
*  There then likely will be a 24-hour waiting period where there could be people in the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=287.78s)]
*  Israeli government who actually oppose this, surprisingly saying that it's not a harsh [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=292.62s)]
*  enough response against Hamas. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=296.9s)]
*  And then the court would overrule that and it would move forward. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=298.76s)]
*  That's how it is expected to play out in Israel. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=301.46s)]
*  But when we talk about how sensitive this deal is, I was speaking this morning with [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=304.05999999999995s)]
*  someone who often provides a lot of information about these negotiations. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=308.26s)]
*  And he requested every part of our conversation stay off the record. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=312.41999999999996s)]
*  There's an understanding on the ground that any sort of information or movement or any [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=316.02s)]
*  development on the ground inside Gaza could put this deal at risk. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=320.73999999999995s)]
*  Even once the initial push that gets 10 to 12 hostages moves forward, it still could [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=325.53999999999996s)]
*  collapse because in the past we have seen ceasefires collapse very quickly. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=330.46s)]
*  Hamas and Islamic Jihad, they are not rational actors. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=334.9s)]
*  And despite coming to the table so that they can get this time to regroup and maybe get [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=337.85999999999996s)]
*  some of their leadership into safer areas of Gaza, in the past they have fired on Israeli [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=341.94s)]
*  forces during these lulls and fighting. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=346.85999999999996s)]
*  They still have to remain on high alert inside Gaza. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=349.34s)]
*  Remember, there are thousands of infantry troops still operating in the Strip. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=351.94s)]
*  They could be ambushed. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=355.56s)]
*  They could be attacked. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=356.56s)]
*  And the Israelis are going to remain on high alert even if their surveillance capabilities [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=357.56s)]
*  are reduced as part of this agreement. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=361.62s)]
*  So Trey, the IDF continues to operate at Al-Shifa Hospital. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=363.9s)]
*  It's also at the Jabalia camp now looking for Hamas tunnels, looking for Hamas infrastructure. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=367.7s)]
*  Does the IDF still believe that the Hamas leadership is headquartered under Al-Shifa? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=376.71999999999997s)]
*  Or as you suggested, have the main players, Yahya Sienwa and Mohammed Daif, perhaps bugged [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=381.29999999999995s)]
*  out of there and headed for safer parts maybe in the south of Gaza? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=388.03999999999996s)]
*  It's likely that Mohammed Daif and Yahya Sienwa left Gaza City possibly even weeks ago. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=394.82s)]
*  They are likely in Hanunis. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=400.78s)]
*  You'll remember that Sienwa, his nickname is the Butcher of Hanunis. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=402.65999999999997s)]
*  It's where he was born and raised and Mohammed Daif was actually his neighbor growing up. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=406.78s)]
*  These are the two masterminds behind the October 7th massacre in southern Israel. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=410.78s)]
*  And they are at the top of the Israeli target list. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=416.09999999999997s)]
*  So Israel will continue to go after these individuals. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=418.29999999999995s)]
*  There's an understanding on the ground that even once this war is over, whether it be [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=422.26s)]
*  weeks or months from now, that the Israelis, they have a long memory and they will continue [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=425.3s)]
*  to hunt down Hamas leadership even if they don't kill them in the initial war. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=430.14s)]
*  We should also note when we talk about the civilian population, we've been raising questions [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=434.68s)]
*  to the Israelis about how they will operate in the southern part of Gaza. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=438.65999999999997s)]
*  They have projected this idea that they will operate to destroy Hamas leadership throughout [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=442.41999999999996s)]
*  the strip and completely demilitarize Gaza. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=446.5s)]
*  But the civilian death toll in Gaza continues to rise. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=449.58s)]
*  They will face more international pressure, not just from their key ally, the United States, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=452.58s)]
*  but from European partners, those who are asking questions about the operations inside [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=456.94s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=460.9s)]
*  But the focus today very much remains on the highly anticipated possibility that a prisoner [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=461.9s)]
*  swap deal takes place. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=466.74s)]
*  In terms of the details, Israeli media is reporting this will be a three to one deal. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=468.3s)]
*  So for every single Israeli hostage that is released, there will be a Palestinian prisoner [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=473.18s)]
*  released along with two others. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=477.3s)]
*  So three Palestinian prisoners in exchange for one Israeli hostage. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=478.82s)]
*  We're talking about women and children here. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=482.3s)]
*  And the Israelis have put one caveat on the deal. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=484.22s)]
*  They do not want anyone who was convicted of murder currently sitting in an Israeli [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=486.56s)]
*  prison to be released. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=490.78000000000003s)]
*  They want to ensure they're not releasing the most dangerous people out into the streets [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=492.42s)]
*  where they are from, either in Gaza or the West Bank, so that they could commit another [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=495.94s)]
*  attack. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=500.06s)]
*  John, Sandra? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=501.06s)]
*  Yesterday I had an interview with the Israel president Herzog and he said they're dealing [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=502.94s)]
*  with a psychopath in these negotiations. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=509.22s)]
*  So all of these conditions, they have to just somehow assume in making this deal that they're [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=513.02s)]
*  going to come through and meet these conditions. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=521.38s)]
*  And we have yet to know what condition these hostages will be in when they're passed over, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=523.86s)]
*  if they're passed over. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=528.74s)]
*  You raise a great point. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=532.7399999999999s)]
*  And during our reporting in the past inside the Gaza Strip, I have sat with Hamas leadership [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=533.78s)]
*  and Islamic Jihad leadership and I've posed questions to them about Israel and the existence [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=538.6199999999999s)]
*  of the Jewish state. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=543.14s)]
*  And their mindset is so different from the Israelis when they go into a negotiation like [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=544.6999999999999s)]
*  this. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=548.7399999999999s)]
*  They don't care if they lose thousands of their own civilians. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=549.7399999999999s)]
*  We saw that on display when they committed a massacre that they knew would draw such [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=553.18s)]
*  a heavy Israeli response. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=557.6199999999999s)]
*  And so when we talk about the release of these hostages, Israelis have to go into these negotiations [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=559.5s)]
*  understanding they will get what they can now. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=564.34s)]
*  If that means dozens of women and children, they will take that as part of a deal that [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=567.0600000000001s)]
*  they are now talking about as we speak within the security cabinet. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=570.98s)]
*  But they also understand the negotiations could collapse at any moment. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=574.6800000000001s)]
*  The deal could collapse at any moment. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=578.1s)]
*  It won't necessarily take five days, a day or two in. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=579.58s)]
*  Hamas and Islamic Jihad could renew rocket fire on major population centers here. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=582.5s)]
*  They have to keep all of that in mind, understanding they're not negotiating with a reasonable [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=586.7s)]
*  actor. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=590.34s)]
*  And when they move forward, they will continue to operate in the Gaza Strip, understanding [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=591.34s)]
*  that some of the civilians and some of the soldiers that were dragged against their will [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=595.6600000000001s)]
*  into Gaza on October 7th just simply may never return home. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=599.7s)]
*  All right. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=603.6600000000001s)]
*  Trey Yanks for us with the latest from southern Israel. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=605.6600000000001s)]
*  Trey, stand by as we wait to see if this deal actually comes together. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=607.82s)]
*  Meantime. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaDkJyV9jqs&t=612.3000000000001s)]
