# John Kirby: Israel has taken steps to be more careful, precise
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y)
*  Terrible news this afternoon that has just broken a short time ago. These three young men, who were three of the 135 hostages, were found dead. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=0.0s)]
*  They were caught in the crosshairs of the Israel-Hamas war. Israel says that their military forces accidentally identified them as a threat on the ground [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=14.0s)]
*  and fired at them in the midst of hostilities and an intense moment on the battleground. We just heard, we spoke to one of the former spokesmen from Israel and that's the way he termed it. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=23.0s)]
*  So the United States and Israel appear to be at growing odds over what the future holds for the region and how to fight this war. Listen to this. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=36.0s)]
*  I want them to be focused on how to save civilian lives, not stop going after Hamas, but be more careful. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=45.0s)]
*  So, Spring and John Kirby, NSC coordinator for strategic communications. John, welcome. Always good to have you here. You hear the president there with that admonishment. Be more careful to the IDF. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=53.0s)]
*  I wouldn't call it an admonishment, Martha. This is a consistent message that we've been having with our Israeli counterparts now for many weeks. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=67.0s)]
*  Understanding their need and right and responsibility to go after Hamas and these leaders that perpetrated this terrible attack on the 7th of October. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=74.0s)]
*  At the same time, like any modern military, doing what they can to reduce civilian casualties and to try to minimize any damage to civilian infrastructure. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=81.0s)]
*  Both can be done. Both are important. And as you heard the president say, we're continuing to urge both. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=88.0s)]
*  So, but what I'm hearing, Jake Sullivan also talked about how we're now in the middle of the high intensity phase. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=94.0s)]
*  There's going to be a transition to another phase in this war that will be more targeted. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=99.0s)]
*  I haven't heard that from Israeli leadership in terms of making that shift. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=104.0s)]
*  So tell me about where, you know, where the divide is between the White House and where Israel is at this point on the focus and whether or not we've given $10 billion to Israel over the last several years. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=109.0s)]
*  So if this isn't carried out the way that the White House wants it to be and isn't more careful, might that change? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=121.0s)]
*  We aren't dictating terms to the Israelis. They will fight the fight the way that they feel they need to to protect their people and their country. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=127.0s)]
*  We're not we're not legislating terms to them on how they do that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=135.0s)]
*  However, we have talked to them about their plans, their plans to do a transition, a phase transition to lower intensity operations. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=139.0s)]
*  They should speak to that when that's going to happen, how that's going to happen, what that's going to look like. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=146.0s)]
*  But that's something that they have talked to us about their about their intentions. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=151.0s)]
*  I think you can understand why we wouldn't want to telegraph too much information about those plans. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=154.0s)]
*  Lest Hamas can figure out where things are going for them. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=159.0s)]
*  We don't want to violate their operational security. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=163.0s)]
*  We've talked to them about what that transition is going to look like. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=165.0s)]
*  Jake was asking some tough questions about sort of what they're thinking of in terms of not just timing, but size and scale and scope. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=168.0s)]
*  But ultimately, these are decisions the Israeli defense forces have got to make. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=174.0s)]
*  They've got to do what they believe is in their best interest to protect their people. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=178.0s)]
*  So when I spoke to Shahar Azani a short time ago, he's the former Israeli diplomat. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=182.0s)]
*  He was just in Israel and is in touch with the leadership there as well. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=187.0s)]
*  He said basically that, OK, we have it now. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=192.0s)]
*  So let's put it this way. We're talking about these three individuals who were who were killed, who lost their lives, these hostages. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=196.0s)]
*  And he was defending Israel's Israel's rules of engagement here. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=203.0s)]
*  But he says because of them, we lose people every day because of the strictures on the way we have to do this. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=208.0s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=215.0s)]
*  We're dealing with a diabolical enemy that's using our hostages as human shields. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=216.0s)]
*  And even I can tell you now, Martha is actually booby trapping those tunnels by using teddy bears, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=222.0s)]
*  backpacks of children and even voices of dolls in Hebrew to lure in the idea of soldiers to make them think, Martha, that it's one of the babies. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=228.0s)]
*  So would you agree with that, that that that they are being so careful because of the rules of engagement that they're losing more IDF soldiers? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=236.0s)]
*  And are those rules of engagement in part coming from from the White House? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=245.0s)]
*  We are not dictating rules of engagement on the battlefield to another military. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=248.0s)]
*  We would have no right to do that. No, no, not at all. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=252.0s)]
*  I can't speak to the R.O.E. Heck, I don't even talk about American R.O.E. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=256.0s)]
*  I certainly can't speak to Israeli rules of engagement. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=259.0s)]
*  That's really for them to speak to. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=262.0s)]
*  As I have been saying now for so much so many days, they have taken seriously and they've been receptive to the messages about being careful and cautious. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=263.0s)]
*  And they have taken steps to try to be more targeted, more precise. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=273.0s)]
*  And part of the part of those steps, Martha, is using ground forces and not just relying on airstrikes. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=277.0s)]
*  And when you put troops on the ground, as we know from our own bitter experience, you're putting some of those troops in harm's way in order to try to protect civilians. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=282.0s)]
*  And the IDF is are making steps in that direction. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=290.0s)]
*  And I can't speak to the details of this particular operation. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=293.0s)]
*  It's tragic, tragic news. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=295.0s)]
*  But the Israelis didn't try to cover it up. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=297.0s)]
*  They came right out and admitted that they made a mistake and they killed these these three innocent hostages who shouldn't have been taken hostage, quite frankly, in the first place. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=299.0s)]
*  That's absolutely true. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=306.0s)]
*  They were both taken from kibbutz in southern Israel just across the border. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=307.0s)]
*  From the Gaza Strip, a place where a lot of those people helped you to volunteer in the Gaza Strip, by the way. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=311.0s)]
*  Go ahead. What do you want to say? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=317.0s)]
*  I was going to say just your point, because I think you're making a really strong point is this is the this is the enemy they're up against. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=318.0s)]
*  You know, Hamas deliberately conducted these attacks in order to kill, but also to take hostage as a playbook, as a strategy. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=324.0s)]
*  And they have deliberately placed the innocent people of Gaza, but also these hostages in harm's way. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=330.0s)]
*  As you rightly said, you know, putting them in the crossfire when you opened up this segment, I can't speak to the details of this operation, but this is part of what they're up against the Israeli Defense Forces, an enemy that uses innocent people as a shield. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=336.0s)]
*  I want to play this soundbite from Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=349.0s)]
*  Let's play this. Yes, there are disputes about the day after Hamas, and I hope you will reach an agreement here as well. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=351.0s)]
*  I want to clarify my position. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=359.0s)]
*  I will not let Israel repeat the Oslo mistake after the great sacrifice of our citizens and fighters. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=361.0s)]
*  We will not bring into Gaza those who educate terrorism, support terrorism, finance terrorism. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=367.0s)]
*  I mean, when I spoke with this former diplomat, it doesn't sound like Israel is not in favor of a two state solution. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=373.0s)]
*  The president says he wants that conversation to be back on the table. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=379.0s)]
*  What do you say to that? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=384.0s)]
*  Well, you know, you know, we're not going to agree with with our friends and allies on every single issue. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=385.0s)]
*  I'll let the Israelis speak to where they are on this. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=390.0s)]
*  I can just tell you that President Biden still believes that a two state solution is viable and can be achieved. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=393.0s)]
*  Now, obviously, it's not going to happen tomorrow. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=398.0s)]
*  We understand that right now the fight is against Hamas and making sure the Israeli people can live safely and freely. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=400.0s)]
*  We want the same for the Palestinian people. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=406.0s)]
*  And the way to do that in the president's view is a two state solution. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=408.0s)]
*  And we still believe it's an effort worth pursuing in Saudi Arabia. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=411.0s)]
*  In Saudi Arabia, Jake, our national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, had discussions with Saudi leaders about moving the process of normalization with Israel forward. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=414.0s)]
*  Obviously, that's not going to happen soon either. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=422.0s)]
*  But that's an important stepping stone to trying to get there, to getting something for the Palestinian people. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=423.0s)]
*  Well, we spoke with the Goldberg Poland family yesterday. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=428.0s)]
*  All of these families want to bring their people home. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=431.0s)]
*  There are some reports that there's only one hundred and sixteen of them who are still alive. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=434.0s)]
*  So we hope that that reopens, that those negotiations get back on the table soon. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=438.0s)]
*  We got to leave it there, John. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=442.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=443.0s)]
*  Always good to see you, John Kirby. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=444.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcsiDQDq2-Y&t=445.0s)]
