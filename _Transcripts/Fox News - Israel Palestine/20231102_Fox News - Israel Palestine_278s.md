# Biden accused of sending 'mixed signals' to Israel
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII)
*  bringing the author of Total Empire, retired U.S. Army Brigadier General Anthony Tata and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=0.0s)]
*  Abe Hamade, former U.S. Army Reserve captain and intelligence officer. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=4.84s)]
*  Gentlemen, thank you both for coming on here. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  General to you first, I want to put this up. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=11.72s)]
*  This is the Wall Street Journal editorial board from today, how Hamas defines the ceasefire. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=13.42s)]
*  Going on to write, Hamas promises more massacres in Arabic while asking for humanitarian reprieve [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  in English. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=25.52s)]
*  We know from experience that some Westerners are gullible enough to fall for it and we [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=26.52s)]
*  know they're falling for it General because we see it every single day. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=32.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=35.8s)]
*  With these Harvard students and college campuses all over, you know, there's a real sickness [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=37.26s)]
*  in the minds of some of these people that are supporting Hamas terrorists that brutally [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=43.3s)]
*  slaughtered the Israelis when they crossed the border on October 7th. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=48.739999999999995s)]
*  So Israel is moving very deliberately with three divisions in Gaza and they have a good [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=54.52s)]
*  plan and I continue to believe that they're being very methodical about this. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=60.82s)]
*  Yeah, and listen Captain Hamade, Abe, if you don't believe this then you just hear it from [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=65.04s)]
*  one of the Hamas officials who said this. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=69.4s)]
*  Israel is a country that has no place on our land. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=74.0s)]
*  We must remove that country because it constitutes a security, military and political catastrophe [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=75.92s)]
*  to the Arab and Islamic nation. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=81.16s)]
*  It must be finished. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=82.96s)]
*  We are not ashamed to say this with full force. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=84.64s)]
*  Yeah, bottom line is they want Israel eradicated. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=86.96s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=90.06s)]
*  That's exactly right and that's why you're seeing this quickly divulge into a regional [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=91.06s)]
*  conflict. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=95.6s)]
*  I mean right now you're seeing, you know, the Iranians, militias in Syria and Iraq on [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=96.6s)]
*  the move but you also saw in Yemen with these Houthi missile attacks coming in and trying [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=100.88s)]
*  to strike Israel. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=105.88s)]
*  So this is quickly turning into a regional conflict where Israel needs to have its focus [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=107.12s)]
*  on Gaza because, you know, they have two main objectives right now in Gaza. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=111.2s)]
*  It's to eradicate Hamas' leadership and it's also to free and rescue those hostages that [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=115.32000000000001s)]
*  have been taken. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=119.84s)]
*  So, you know, Israel right now needs much more moral support from the United States [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=120.84s)]
*  and I believe the Biden administration has been sending a lot of mixed signals. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=124.08000000000001s)]
*  First of all telling them to delay their invasion and I think that's allowed Hamas to regroup [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=128.18s)]
*  but it's also sent a signal to all these other terrorist groups around the region to arm [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=133.32s)]
*  and to, you know, right now attack Israel. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=137.48s)]
*  Yeah, they need better signaling, that's for sure. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=139.6s)]
*  General, this is from Nasr Imani. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=142.04s)]
*  He's an analyst close to the Iranian government. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=144.0s)]
*  He tells the New York Times the following, quoting here, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=146.72s)]
*  It is telling all of them, including Hezbollah, to keep things boiling but have restraint. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=162.32s)]
*  And that's the truth. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=168.64s)]
*  They just keep attacking U.S. forces, keep attacking, you know, northern Israel and waiting [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=169.64s)]
*  for the next response. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=175.16s)]
*  Yep. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=177.56s)]
*  General, let's go back. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  Let's go to Abe. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=182.64s)]
*  When we get the general back, we'll let him answer that. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=183.64s)]
*  What are your thoughts on that, Abe? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=185.4s)]
*  Well, I think that's exactly the MO of Iran. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=186.88s)]
*  Their most successful military operation is Hezbollah. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=190.48s)]
*  I mean, it costs them not that much money if you think about the damage that they can [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=193.64s)]
*  inflict on Israel. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=197.32s)]
*  So the idea right now is to boil this over, keep it simmering. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=198.52s)]
*  I mean, this is a 27-day war, as you mentioned in the program, compared to the six-day war [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  in 1967 and in 1973, that was over in less than a month. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=207.2s)]
*  So, you know, right now, Iran knows that this is much more of a psychological operation, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=211.36s)]
*  information warfare. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=216.04s)]
*  So that's why it's very concerning when you have these college campuses, you know, they're [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=217.52s)]
*  basically hunting down Jews, Trace. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=221.32000000000002s)]
*  It's very scary. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=224.16000000000003s)]
*  And, you know, I think, you know, my friend in Las Vegas just posted a photo today where [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=225.16000000000003s)]
*  one on her way to school said, kill the Jews, free Gaza. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=228.88s)]
*  But you know, they're just getting a lot of misinformation right now from Hamas. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=232.32000000000002s)]
*  They're propagating pro-Hamas propaganda. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=235.84s)]
*  Yeah, let me just get the general here for 15 seconds. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=237.20000000000002s)]
*  We got you back. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=239.56s)]
*  General, is the war going how you think Israel wants it to go? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=240.56s)]
*  I think Israel is prosecuting this in a very methodical way. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=245.12s)]
*  And I would just like to say that I think we need more people like Abe, veterans in [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=248.32000000000002s)]
*  Congress, and so I fully support Abe's run for Congress. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=252.68s)]
*  And he's done a great job representing military veterans. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=256.68s)]
*  And he's a good analyst to boot. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=262.04s)]
*  So thank you, Abe. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=263.32s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=264.56s)]
*  General, we appreciate your time. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi80anJmSII&t=265.56s)]
