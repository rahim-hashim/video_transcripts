# Trey Yingst: 2 Israeli soldiers killed, 2 injured in Gaza
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI)
*  All right, let's get to this breaking news. Trey Yanks in southern Israel now. Trey, take it away. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, hey guys, good afternoon. Fox News has learned that two Israeli soldiers were killed today [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=7.84s)]
*  inside Gaza during battles with Hamas militants. Two other Israeli soldiers were wounded. We've [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=14.24s)]
*  known about this since this morning but been unable to report it as the military needed to [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  inform the families of these two soldiers. We also have their names for you. They are Staff [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=25.44s)]
*  Sergeant Roy Wolff, a 20-year-old from Ramat Gan, and Staff Sergeant Lavi Lipschitz, a 20-year-old [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  from Modain. Both of them were in the Gevati reconnaissance unit that was operating inside [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=36.24s)]
*  the Gaza Strip behind me when they were engaged by Hamas militants and killed in that battle. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=42.08s)]
*  Again, two other soldiers were injured. Today has been a difficult day for the Israeli forces as [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=47.6s)]
*  they look to push deeper into the Gaza Strip. We could see from this position as they were operating [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=53.2s)]
*  just outside of a tank and an armored D9 bulldozer. The Israelis are being ambushed by Hamas and Islam [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  Jihad fighters inside. We've seen video published by Hamas showing some of these ambushes. It's an [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=65.68s)]
*  incredibly difficult environment for the Israelis to be operating in because they are pushing [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=71.92s)]
*  forward, but they are facing a resistance by these fighters inside Gaza. We do understand [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=77.44s)]
*  there have been a number of gun battles taking place, and the Israelis say they will continue [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  these operations. We did have one piece of good news amid this horrific story yesterday when the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=87.2s)]
*  Israelis were able to rescue Ori Megadish, a soldier, a private who was taken into Gaza by [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=93.28s)]
*  Hamas on October 7th. She was rescued as part of an operation conducted by the Israeli army and the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  Israeli intelligence, the Shin Bet, and she is now reunited with her family in southern Israel. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=105.12s)]
*  But again, the breaking news that we can bring you right now, Fox News has learned two Israeli [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=110.56s)]
*  soldiers were killed today in those battles behind me in the Gaza Strip. Guys, back to you. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=115.04s)]
*  Just real quickly, Trey, because this is something that we were warned about, how hard this fight was [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=119.36s)]
*  going to be and that it would be somewhat like those hard fighting days that the United States [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=124.88000000000001s)]
*  faced in Fallujah, where they were able to get some civilians out of the way so they could take [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=129.12s)]
*  on about 3,000 of the enemy. These numbers are much bigger. Now, you got more people to move and [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=134.0s)]
*  you're going to see a lot more Hamas than you did the enemy in Fallujah. How much of this is [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=141.12s)]
*  hand-to-hand combat already? You're saying they're outside the tanks and the bulldozers. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=146.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great question. There are more than two million Palestinian civilians [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=153.6s)]
*  inside Gaza. The majority of them have moved south, but there are still many in Gaza City, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=157.12s)]
*  in the area that the Israelis are looking to cut off. And without getting too into the details of [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=162.56s)]
*  a conversation I had earlier today, I met with Israel's Defense Minister, Yoav Galant, today in [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=167.12s)]
*  Tel Aviv, and we talked about this very issue. And I will simply say that the Israelis understand [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=171.84s)]
*  there will be a price to pay in this operation, but they are determined to defeat Hamas and they [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=177.44s)]
*  are willing to pay that price because of the massacre that took place on October 7th. They [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=182.56s)]
*  understand the intense battlefield conditions that they will face, and they are also trying to draw [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=187.52s)]
*  on the lessons of the United States from places like Fallujah or when the Western-led coalition [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=192.32s)]
*  went into Mosul and defeated ISIS. Understanding that they are up against tunnels and urban [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=196.88s)]
*  environments, they will be ambushed, they will face IEDs and anti-tank weapons and RPGs that are [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  currently produced inside Gaza. And so this will be a difficult battle and it's part of the reason [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=208.0s)]
*  they are preparing the Israelis not for weeks, but rather months of fighting. We want to remind [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=213.6s)]
*  everybody, citizens and Israeli all serve. And some of these ages are very young. They are [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=218.16s)]
*  reminiscent to when America has fought wars abroad like Vietnam. You'll hear those ages, 18, 19, 20. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=223.76s)]
*  The two soldiers killed today, 20 years old. Trey Yanks, thank you very much. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emkJ_kqLwI&t=230.64s)]
