# Israeli ambassador's warning to Palestinians
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [January 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c)
*  So how are Israeli officials looking at this complex deal and how it is playing out with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=0.0s)]
*  us now? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=6.76s)]
*  The Israeli ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=7.76s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, it's always great to talk to you. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=10.56s)]
*  I just want to pick up on what Trey was saying about Abel Yehud, the fifth hostage who was [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=12.52s)]
*  supposed to be released yesterday. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=17.8s)]
*  We're hearing from Islamic Jihad now that she will now be released. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=20.12s)]
*  Are you confident that that is going to happen? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=25.36s)]
*  Jonathan, we signed a very detailed agreement with Hamas and with the negotiators. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=28.840000000000003s)]
*  Unfortunately, we see that Hamas is breaching the agreement. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=34.68s)]
*  We are negotiating the release of Abel and we hope that by the end of the week we will [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=38.28s)]
*  see her back home if she was supposed to be released by now. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=42.68s)]
*  And we are working on that. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=47.0s)]
*  So we are continuing with the agreement, but we expect Hamas to stand up for the agreement [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  Not only with the release of Abel, they also were supposed to give us a list of all the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=54.0s)]
*  hostages and with the details of their health condition. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=58.8s)]
*  We haven't got that list yet. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=62.36s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, I was interested hearing President Trump say on Saturday that he would like to [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=65.2s)]
*  see Egypt and Jordan take in many of the displaced Palestinians who have lost their homes, obviously, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=70.92s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=79.36s)]
*  We have a pushback from Egypt and Jordan and it seems to me an ongoing part of the situation [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=80.84s)]
*  in the Middle East that those countries and others do not want to have the Palestinian [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=87.39999999999999s)]
*  people on their territories. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=93.39999999999999s)]
*  How much of a problem is that? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=96.28s)]
*  And what does it speak to in a broader perspective? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=98.36s)]
*  Well, I think President Trump, you know, he has very creative ideas and he realizes that [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=101.08s)]
*  if you need a sustainable solution, you need to think about new ideas. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=106.4s)]
*  And we cannot allow Hamas to stay in charge in Gaza and to rebuild its force. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=111.88000000000001s)]
*  There is no future for the Palestinian in Gaza if Hamas is there. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=116.84s)]
*  So I think it is about time that many countries will not only talk about the Palestinian issue, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=120.56s)]
*  but will actually take action in order to support their future. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=126.04s)]
*  And to say clearly, there is no future for the Palestinian if Hamas is still in power. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=129.88s)]
*  That's very clear for us. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=135.35999999999999s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, it was fascinating when the four IDF soldiers, the four women, were released. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=136.79999999999998s)]
*  Next to them, sort of as they were being paraded, they were full of smiles. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=145.23999999999998s)]
*  Next to them were masked Hamas fighters. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=150.64s)]
*  It does not appear that Hamas has lost its grip on power in Gaza. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  Is that a failure for the Israeli war effort here? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=159.56s)]
*  We haven't completed the mission, I agree with you. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=165.2s)]
*  But you know, Hamas today is not the same Hamas that was in power before October 7th. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=167.79999999999998s)]
*  You know, all the leadership, Yichassin Wah, Mohamed Ev, they are all dead by now, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=172.92s)]
*  thankful to the work of the IDF. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=178.0s)]
*  But they don't have the capabilities in terms of threatening us. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=180.84s)]
*  But we have to continue the mission to finish the job. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=184.04s)]
*  And that means that we have to make sure that Hamas is not running Gaza anymore. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=187.44s)]
*  If they will stay in power, it's only a matter of time before the next attack. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=191.79999999999998s)]
*  And Mr. Ambassador, if we can move north to Lebanon, some problems I gather that the Israelis [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=196.88s)]
*  see with the Lebanese army fulfilling its role near the border areas there. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=203.39999999999998s)]
*  How is that playing out? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=208.6s)]
*  So first of all, we comply with the agreement and we respect the agreement. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=211.23999999999998s)]
*  We want to move out of Lebanon. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=215.07999999999998s)]
*  But the agreement states very clearly that the Lebanese military must come in and take [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=217.52s)]
*  the positions. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=222.68s)]
*  We cannot allow Hezbollah to regroup and take hold of those positions. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=223.68s)]
*  So we expect the Lebanese military to move faster. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=228.28s)]
*  That's why I think we need a little bit more time to allow the Lebanese military to get [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=231.28s)]
*  organized and to take the positions that we are evacuating. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=235.64000000000001s)]
*  And then very briefly, Mr. Ambassador, Islamic Jihad seems to be getting more of a hold in [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=240.32000000000002s)]
*  the West Bank and to some extent in Gaza. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=247.4s)]
*  How concerned are you about a group as radical as Islamic Jihad beginning to get more support [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=250.32s)]
*  in areas like the West Bank? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=257.64s)]
*  We are very concerned and we have seen the influx of terror attacks. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=260.46s)]
*  But you know, all the issues we discussed today, it's all connected to Iran. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=264.52s)]
*  They are the ones who are feeding Hamas, feeding Hezbollah, and now they're feeding the terrorists [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=267.36s)]
*  in Judea and Samaria. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=272.84000000000003s)]
*  They're sending weapons and ammunition. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=274.6s)]
*  So I think at the end of the day, Hezbollah, the new administration, Western democracies, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=276.92s)]
*  we have to deal with Tehran. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=281.76s)]
*  That is the source of the problem for the Western world. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=282.76s)]
*  For sure. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  Okay, Mr. Ambassador, it's always a pleasure to talk to you. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=286.84000000000003s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us today. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=289.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XPSsteJ9c&t=290.96000000000004s)]
