# Ilhan Omar pressed on Jewish students' safety at Columbia
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU)
*  In time hundreds of pro-Israel demonstrators are now holding a rally just outside Columbia [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=0.0s)]
*  University. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=5.16s)]
*  Inside, another deadline for anti-Israel protesters to clear out has come and gone. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=6.16s)]
*  And they are still negotiating with the school administration meantime. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Hundreds of anti-Israel protesters have also occupied George Washington University's campus [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=16.86s)]
*  in Washington D.C. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=21.92s)]
*  And we've got dramatic video which shows the protest which has spread to dozens of colleges [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=23.64s)]
*  all across the country. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=29.96s)]
*  At times they've gotten so chaotic and violent that police have had to step in. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=32.44s)]
*  Since April 17th, 34 of the top 50 U.S. universities have seen anti-Israel protests on their campuses. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=36.56s)]
*  And I'm talking anti-Semitic anger. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=45.84s)]
*  That includes top schools like Harvard, MIT, and Princeton. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=48.86s)]
*  CB Cotton is at Columbia right now with the very latest there. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=53.8s)]
*  Hey, CB. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=56.84s)]
*  Hi, Julie. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=57.84s)]
*  Nice to see you. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=58.92s)]
*  Yeah, the crowd just started dispersing moments ago. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=59.92s)]
*  But there were, I would say, about 500 people gathered here, pro-Israel supporters, family [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=62.96s)]
*  members of some of the Israeli hostages who gathered here together to show solidarity [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=69.08s)]
*  with Israel as these pro-Palestinian demonstrations continue to spread across college campuses [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=74.28s)]
*  all across the country. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=80.16s)]
*  The people who were here say it's important for them to let the community know calls for [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=81.44s)]
*  a ceasefire should also include calls for hostages to be released. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=86.92s)]
*  Now, in the meantime, as you mentioned, Julie, Columbia University is trying to figure out [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=91.64s)]
*  how to clear out that pro-Palestinian encampment in time for the undergraduate commencement [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=96.75999999999999s)]
*  on May 15th. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=103.0s)]
*  A university spokesperson says there's progress as discussions continue with student demonstrators. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=104.0s)]
*  And those demonstrators, they've pledged to stay camped out until the university meets [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=110.0s)]
*  their demands. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=114.32s)]
*  Listen. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=115.52s)]
*  We are calling upon Columbia University to divest, disclose, and provide amnesty for [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=116.83999999999999s)]
*  all students and faculty disciplined in the movement for Palestinian liberation. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=124.6s)]
*  Those are our central demands. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=131.6s)]
*  And until those are met, we will not be going anywhere. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=133.12s)]
*  We will continue to protest. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=136.22s)]
*  Minnesota Congresswoman Ilhan Omar joined the student protesters with her daughter yesterday [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=140.16s)]
*  on campus. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=145.16s)]
*  She told our Fox affiliate all Jewish students should be protected regardless of whether [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=146.24s)]
*  they're quote pro-genocide or anti-genocide. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=151.48000000000002s)]
*  I want to let you listen to her remarks directly from her. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=154.4s)]
*  I think it is really unfortunate that people don't care about the fact that all Jewish [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  kids should be kept safe and that we should not have to tolerate anti-Semitism or bigotry [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=165.24s)]
*  for all Jewish students, whether they are pro-genocide or anti-genocide. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=172.56s)]
*  And the last, the bottom half of her statement, that is the kind of rhetoric that Jewish students [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=179.44s)]
*  here at Columbia University tell me has made this environment, has made this campus feel [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=184.16s)]
*  unsafe for them. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=189.24s)]
*  Julie, there are a lot more developments we're watching for out here on campus, and we will [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=190.6s)]
*  be monitoring. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=195.0s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=196.0s)]
*  I want to try to get a breakdown as to how many of these actual protesters are students [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=197.0s)]
*  at these schools, because obviously these protests are getting a lot of national coverage [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=201.04s)]
*  because they are at colleges and it's very controversial as to what in the heck are they [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=205.28s)]
*  doing when they should be learning and educating at these colleges. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=209.32s)]
*  So could a lot of these protests be led by those who have nothing to do with the university [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=212.95999999999998s)]
*  and they're just simply using these campuses as an excuse to get the attention they're [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=219.12s)]
*  clearly getting? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=224.04s)]
*  Well, you know, Julie, Columbia University said in its ongoing negotiations with these [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=226.04s)]
*  student demonstrators that the people behind this, the students behind this have committed [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=232.64s)]
*  to removing any non-students from the encampment. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=236.76s)]
*  But I can tell you, Julie, I hear from a lot of Jewish students on this campus who tell [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=240.32s)]
*  me they still see non-students, grown adults who are milling about on campus every single [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=243.72s)]
*  day. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=250.16s)]
*  So you bring up a lot of interesting points. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=251.16s)]
*  And this is why House Republicans right now are calling for Columbia University's president [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=253.64000000000001s)]
*  to resign, the handling of this ongoing encampment. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=258.4s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's just a starter. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=261.48s)]
*  As far as the way that these university presidents are handling this, I mean, you know, everyone [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=265.12s)]
*  has the right to protest, we understand that, but this has just grown so out of control. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=269.32s)]
*  I mean, it really has just spread like a wildfire with, you know, dozens of universities taking [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=272.76s)]
*  part and sadly the Ivy League schools in this country that are supposed to be, you know, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=276.88s)]
*  nurturing and educating some of America's smartest future professionals. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=281.2s)]
*  And this is what it's come down to. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=286.92s)]
*  At what point do they simply just shut it down or they say, okay, then these protests [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=288.64s)]
*  can happen, but they need to happen elsewhere, not on our campus. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=293.15999999999997s)]
*  And again, you bring up another really valid point. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=298.68s)]
*  Columbia University in its latest update to the community said they will not be bringing [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=302.28s)]
*  the NYPD in to clear out this encampment. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=307.44s)]
*  You just heard from one of those student organizers. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=310.24s)]
*  They say, and I think this is almost sort of fueled the encampment, right, because they [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=313.70000000000005s)]
*  know the administration is not going to bring in the police to clear them out. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=318.02000000000004s)]
*  So who knows how long this will continue? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=323.02000000000004s)]
*  They've already been camped out for more than a week, but there have been pro-Israel Jewish [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=325.78000000000003s)]
*  students and again, House Republicans who have said order needs to be restored to this [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=330.70000000000005s)]
*  campus. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=335.94000000000005s)]
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson called for the National Guard to be brought in. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=337.34s)]
*  Whether that happens has yet to be seen. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=340.66s)]
*  All right, CB Conton, thank you very much. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=342.54s)]
*  Great job as always. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_gqgDMZBU&t=344.46s)]
