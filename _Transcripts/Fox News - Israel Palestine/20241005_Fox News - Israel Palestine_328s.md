# 'EVERY TARGET ON THE TABLE': Ex-Israeli official describes next steps to ensure nation's survival
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE)
*  Now the former Israeli ambassador to the United States, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=0.0s)]
*  Ambassador, always good having you. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=3.88s)]
*  Obviously you've heard from everybody and his uncle, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=5.96s)]
*  it would seem, about what Israel should and should not do. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=8.36s)]
*  From the White House, what you should not do [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=10.96s)]
*  is going after those nuclear facilities. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Somebody's been saying it would be dangerous [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=15.56s)]
*  to go after oil facilities, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=16.96s)]
*  because oil will rocket worldwide if you do. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=18.8s)]
*  In other words, limiting what you can and cannot do. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=20.8s)]
*  Do you think Israel should pay attention to that? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=25.48s)]
*  Good morning, Neil. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=28.880000000000003s)]
*  Always good to be with you. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=30.12s)]
*  Israel's going to do what Israel has to do to defend ourselves. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=31.12s)]
*  Neil, we're in a war of national survival. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=34.24s)]
*  We're fighting a war on several different fronts, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  all against Iran. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=39.52s)]
*  This is, you know, the head of the snake, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=40.72s)]
*  the head of the octopus, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=41.96s)]
*  whatever being you want to compare it to. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  None of this is going to stop [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=45.84s)]
*  until Iran is made to pay a prohibitive price. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  And up to this point, Iran has paid no price, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=50.92s)]
*  certainly not from Israel, but not even from the United States. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=53.64s)]
*  Iran and its proxies have fired at American forces [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=56.0s)]
*  some 200 times in the Middle East. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=58.92s)]
*  Iran has stopped shipping through the Mandab Straits. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  This is a cause of... [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=65.76s)]
*  Iran is the cause of vast, unspeakable damage, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=66.88s)]
*  suffering throughout the entire Middle East. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=70.32s)]
*  So Israel is going to do what Israel has to do [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=72.04s)]
*  in order to ensure our security and indeed our survival. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=74.84s)]
*  And everything, Neil, every target remains on the table. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=77.88s)]
*  I do notice as well, Ambassador, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=81.12s)]
*  to your point about the concerns about Iran, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=82.64s)]
*  I know Israel has plenty of concerns, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=85.72s)]
*  but so do countries like Saudi Arabia, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=87.44s)]
*  even the United Arab Emirates. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=89.2s)]
*  I mean, without saying so, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=90.6s)]
*  their quiet response to everything that's been going on [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=92.48s)]
*  probably says volumes. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=96.36s)]
*  What do you make of what they're thinking? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=97.52s)]
*  I think they are very quietly rooting for us [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=100.96s)]
*  because they have to be. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=104.64s)]
*  These countries are facing [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=105.92s)]
*  twin existential threats themselves. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  One comes from Shiite extremism, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=109.36s)]
*  the form of Iran and Hezbollah. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=112.08s)]
*  The other from Sunni extremism, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=113.28s)]
*  the form of Hamas, ISIS, the Muslim Brotherhood, al-Qaeda. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=114.76s)]
*  There's one country in the Middle East [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=118.56s)]
*  and one country only that's in the Middle East [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=119.64s)]
*  standing up to both of them. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=121.28s)]
*  And if we win and we will win against Hamas and Hezbollah, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=122.84s)]
*  then the chances of peace will greatly, greatly expand. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=127.68s)]
*  I hate to sort of paraphrase John Lennon, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=131.36s)]
*  but if you want peace, you gotta give war a chance. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=134.36s)]
*  And they are rooting for us to beat these people [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=137.08s)]
*  and beat them decisively. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=140.16s)]
*  Now, the issue then becomes what happens [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=141.6s)]
*  after this response because it seems like [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=144.48s)]
*  a very dangerous game, the tennis, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=146.64s)]
*  and it's back in Iran's court, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=149.0s)]
*  what it's gonna do to respond to Israel, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=151.68s)]
*  at least counter-response to what they did. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=153.44s)]
*  And back and forth we go, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=155.44s)]
*  how long do you see this going on and on and on? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=156.72s)]
*  It's gonna go as long as it needs to go long [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=160.64s)]
*  until Israel assures its survival, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=163.28s)]
*  until the Iranian regime internalizes [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=165.16s)]
*  that trying to hurt the state of Israel anyway, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=168.24s)]
*  trying to kill Jews, trying to literally destroy us. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=172.0s)]
*  And by the way, their leaders come out every single day [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=174.44000000000003s)]
*  and say the goal of this regime is to destroy us, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=176.52s)]
*  to destroy a sovereign state. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=179.36s)]
*  Until that stops, we're gonna have to continue. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=181.16000000000003s)]
*  And we are a very rough, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=184.32000000000002s)]
*  we are a tough and resilient society. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=186.12s)]
*  And we've gone through an awful lot [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=188.96s)]
*  in our 76 years of independence. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=191.32000000000002s)]
*  And we'll get through this as well. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=193.52s)]
*  And we've defeated enemy after enemy, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  because at the end of the day, again, we have no choice. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=197.32000000000002s)]
*  And there's clarity in that. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=200.2s)]
*  And we draw tremendous strength from that. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=201.6s)]
*  As well the strength from our sense of history [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=203.92s)]
*  and that this, the land of Israel, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=207.2s)]
*  is our ancestral homeland. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=209.11999999999998s)]
*  And we have come home to the San Francisco homeland, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=210.28s)]
*  not to die, but to live and to thrive [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=212.56s)]
*  and to defend ourselves. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=215.44s)]
*  That's very well put, Ambassador. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=217.07999999999998s)]
*  I did wanna get your take. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=218.35999999999999s)]
*  Obviously I follow money and markets here, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=219.83999999999997s)]
*  so I don't wanna be so crass about that. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=222.67999999999998s)]
*  But if you can indulge me here, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=224.56s)]
*  oil prices have gone up about 10% this week [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  on these heightened tensions. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=228.84s)]
*  They could rocket all the more if oil facilities are hit. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=230.28s)]
*  To that point, we've learned that Iran has repositioned [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=232.76s)]
*  the number of oil tankers and tried to hide them. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=237.28s)]
*  I don't know how you hide an oil tanker, Ambassador, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=239.56s)]
*  but they're doing their best. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=241.36s)]
*  But when I was speaking to Israel authorities, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=243.04s)]
*  including Denny Denon a few minutes ago, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=245.8s)]
*  he made it clear, they made it clear. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=247.88s)]
*  We know where those tankers are. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=249.36s)]
*  We know where those facilities are. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=250.92000000000002s)]
*  And I'm wondering if that is part of their thinking, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=253.4s)]
*  to hit Iran where economically will really be painful. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=257.52s)]
*  Now, the flip side of that is it could be painful [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=261.92s)]
*  for the world if oil prices shoot up and stay up. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=264.6s)]
*  But what do you think? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=267.92s)]
*  Well, I think that, again, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=270.64s)]
*  all options are gonna be on the table here. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=271.6s)]
*  Nothing is off the table. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=273.96s)]
*  And certainly Iran's oil industry [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=275.32s)]
*  and its facilities are vulnerable. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=278.48s)]
*  And yes, they know where they are. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=280.88s)]
*  I just recall back in 1988, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=282.76s)]
*  President Reagan sent the US Navy [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=285.20000000000005s)]
*  to strike those oil facilities [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=287.72s)]
*  after the Iranians were firing at Kuwaiti tankers [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=289.08000000000004s)]
*  in the Persian Gulf, Operation Praying Mantis, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=292.24s)]
*  if you remember this. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=294.52000000000004s)]
*  And they sunk half of the US Navy, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=295.56s)]
*  sunk half of the Iranian Navy. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=298.76000000000005s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=301.64000000000004s)]
*  After that, the Iranians stopped. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=302.48s)]
*  They stopped. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=304.76000000000005s)]
*  And so again, that unequivocal message [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EgEkgQH4kE&t=305.8s)]
