# Lindsey Graham: This is 'heartbreaking' news
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [May 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y)
*  Here with reaction is South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham. Senator, your reaction to this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, that was well done, Sean. Heartbroken in a way, because I know in Jerusalem tonight [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=5.92s)]
*  they're trying to figure out what do we do. The only reason they're not dancing in Iran is because [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=12.72s)]
*  they don't believe in dancing. If you're send war in the tunnel, this is a good moment for you. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=18.32s)]
*  But what does this mean to America? It changes the game in all the worst ways in the war on terror. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=23.6s)]
*  Here's what Joe Biden is asking. He's asking the Israelis to turn the war over to him and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=29.76s)]
*  Lloyd Austin. To my friends in Israel, don't do that. Fight without the weapons. Do not let [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=34.72s)]
*  Joe Biden and Lloyd Austin run this war. They will do for you what they've done for America. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=40.88s)]
*  So my fear is that the hostage deal was hard. Now it's impossible. My fear is that Saudi Arabia, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  that was thinking about recognizing Israel, and I've been working with the Biden administration [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=52.64s)]
*  for a year to bring that deal about. They would have a hard time right now if this continues, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=56.96s)]
*  signing up with a defense agreement with Joe Biden and his team. Who in their right mind in [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=62.64s)]
*  Saudi Arabia would turn their national security over to Joe Biden? So this is heartbreaking, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=68.48s)]
*  it's dangerous, it's pouring gasoline on a fire. And every problem we had in the Mideast just got [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=74.4s)]
*  worse. This is a nightmare for Israel to be abandoned by their best friend in the world. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=81.12s)]
*  And the only way you're going to change this is at the ballot box in November. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=86.32s)]
*  You know, I don't know what this means for Israel. I don't know what it means [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=90.8s)]
*  for every country in the region. I mean, look at what he's already done with Iran. Not only did [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  he turn a blind eye to sanctions and allow the Iranians to sell oil and get rich, you know, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  what, $100 billion plus, he was importing oil since March of 21 from Iran. He allowed, he gave [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=107.11999999999999s)]
*  a waiver to Iraq to give the mullahs $10 billion. He wanted to give them $6 billion in a ransom [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=114.48s)]
*  exchange. What part of Iran being the world's number one state sponsor of terror is he not [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=120.16s)]
*  understanding? And what part of what happened to Israel on October 7th is he not understanding here? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=126.80000000000001s)]
*  No, I think he does, I think he doesn't understand, and that's the problem. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=133.68s)]
*  October the 7th was the largest loss of life of Jewish people since the Holocaust. They're [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=137.12s)]
*  surrounded by Iran, who wants to wipe out the Jewish state. Hamas says, we'll do it again and [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=142.8s)]
*  again and again. Their charter is to destroy Israel, not to help the Palestinians. Then you [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  got Hezbollah with 100,000 rockets pointed at Israel from Lebanon. They're surrounded by radical [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=153.44s)]
*  Islamic terrorists that want to destroy the Jewish state, not help the Palestinians. And what is [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=158.88000000000002s)]
*  Joe Biden's response? To withhold weapons in a war that Israel cannot afford to lose. What did we do [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  after we were attacked in Pearl Harbor? What did we do to end the war against the Japanese? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=170.72s)]
*  We dropped two nuclear weapons on two Japanese cities to make sure our soldiers didn't have to [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=176.72s)]
*  invade Japan, where you could have a million lives lost. What is Joe Biden doing? He's making it [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=182.16s)]
*  impossible for allies throughout the world to trust us. He's making it hard on Israel to win. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=187.28s)]
*  Well, this would be the equivalent of losing 40,000 Americans a day if you extrapolate and [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=194.4s)]
*  compare their population to ours and 8,000 Americans taking off American soil and taking [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=199.28s)]
*  hostage. Let me play your exchange on this very issue you were speaking to with the Secretary [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=204.8s)]
*  of Defense, Secretary Austin. And you're telling me you're going to tell them how to fight the war [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=211.04s)]
*  and what they can and can't use when everybody around them wants to kill all the Jews? And you're [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=218.88s)]
*  telling me that if we withhold weapons in this fight, the existential fight for the life of the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=225.28s)]
*  Jewish state, it won't send the wrong signal? Do you still think it was a good idea, General Austin, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=232.16s)]
*  to get out of Afghanistan? I support the President's decision. Yeah, I think you do. I think it was a [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=237.28s)]
*  disastrous decision. If we stop weapons necessary to destroy the enemies of the state of Israel at [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=243.44s)]
*  a time of great peril, we will pay a price. This is obscene. It is absurd. Give Israel what they [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=251.04s)]
*  need to fight the war they can't afford to lose. If they are ever successful, that was a great [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=258.48s)]
*  exchange, Senator. Then you brought up the issue of, you know, should we use, what are we wrong to [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=265.2s)]
*  use atomic weapons to end World War II? What was his answer? It was a delayed answer. I asked General [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=270.48s)]
*  Brown, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, if you were around in World War II, would you advise [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=280.0s)]
*  dropping the atomic bomb to end the war? He finally said, well, you know, it did end the war. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=284.0s)]
*  You've got to realize that Israel is in a fight for its life. This is not some normal exchange in [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=288.72s)]
*  the Mideast. They want to kill the Jewish state, Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas. And what did they do? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=294.16s)]
*  They put command centers under command centers under hospitals. They hide weapons in mosques [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=299.52s)]
*  and schools. They use human shields to make it hard for Israel to kill the terrorists without [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=305.28s)]
*  killing the Palestinian people. Israel is in a terrible spot because they're fighting a vicious [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=310.96s)]
*  enemy. And Joe Biden today, you picked Michigan over Mideast stability. You picked domestic politics [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  over world stability. What you did tonight, my friend, is that you made every terrorist in the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=326.71999999999997s)]
*  world hezakite. You put our friends in Israel in a box. And here's what they're going to do. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=332.48s)]
*  Here's what I would do if I was Israel. I'd say I appreciate all the support in the past. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=337.92s)]
*  We're going to do what we have to do to destroy Hamas. We're not going to turn the war over to [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=342.0s)]
*  Lord Austin, who thought it was a good idea to get out of Afghanistan. It'd be like asking me, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=347.52000000000004s)]
*  Orcas, could you help us secure our border? To my friends in Israel, do what you have to do. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=352.24s)]
*  Destroy these battalions and don't let Joe Biden give a win to the terrorist. You know what? They're [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=357.28s)]
*  going to win the war without Joe Biden. They're going to win the war without Joe Biden. Yes, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=363.84s)]
*  they got the yes, they will. And it's sad because if they were ever successful in destroying Israel [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=368.32s)]
*  as their charter calls for, we're next. I put that I can promise every American senator. Thank you. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lXTcqj9Y&t=374.4s)]
