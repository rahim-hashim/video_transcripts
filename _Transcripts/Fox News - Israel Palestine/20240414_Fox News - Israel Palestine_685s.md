# Speaker Mike Johnson: 'President Trump is 100% with me'
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g)
*  Iran launched hundreds of drones, ballistic and cruise missiles toward Israel, with Israel's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=0.0s)]
*  military saying that its air defense system fended off 99% of those attacks. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=5.12s)]
*  The Pentagon says American military forces assisted in the defense of Israel, intercepting [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=11.16s)]
*  dozens of missiles and drones originating in Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Yemen. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=15.88s)]
*  Iran claims the attack is in retaliation for a suspected Israeli airstrike nearly two weeks [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=21.72s)]
*  ago on an Iranian diplomatic building in Syria, which killed two top generals. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=26.12s)]
*  Meanwhile, the assault's coming just a month after President Biden signed off on renewing [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  a waiver for Tehran, allowing the Ayatollah to continue to have access to $10 billion [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=34.8s)]
*  in frozen funds. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=40.8s)]
*  Joining me right now with a reaction in this Sunday Morning Future's exclusive is the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=41.8s)]
*  Speaker of the House, Congressman Mike Johnson. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, thanks very much for being here this morning. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=48.52s)]
*  Hey, Maria. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=50.68000000000001s)]
*  Great to be with you, as always. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=51.68000000000001s)]
*  How does this change your plans this week in terms of voting on an aid package for Israel? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=53.84s)]
*  Well, we've understood the urgency of this from the very beginning. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=60.92s)]
*  I mean, a few days after I became Speaker, way back in October, we passed our Israel [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=64.92s)]
*  support package. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  It's been sitting on Chuck Schumer's desk ever since because we included a pay-for, as [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=71.64s)]
*  you remember. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=75.08000000000001s)]
*  What a concept we took from the IRS expansion slush fund to pay for the Israel priority. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=76.08000000000001s)]
*  We tried it again just about a month and a half ago, a clean Israel that many Democrats, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=80.68s)]
*  166, as I remember, in the House voted against. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=86.92s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=89.12s)]
*  Because President Joe Biden said that he would veto that. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=90.12s)]
*  So the House Republicans and the Republican Party understand the necessity of standing [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=91.80000000000001s)]
*  with Israel. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  We are going to try again this week, and the details of that package are being put together [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  right now. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=100.84s)]
*  We're looking at the options and all these supplemental issues. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=101.84s)]
*  Well, the former president, President Trump, has talked about the possibility of turning [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=103.76s)]
*  aid for Ukraine into a loan. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=109.67999999999999s)]
*  Is that what you're considering? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=111.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=113.96s)]
*  You know, I had a great visit with him at Mar-a-Lago on Friday, and he and I are 100 [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=114.96s)]
*  percent united on these big agenda items. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=118.91999999999999s)]
*  And when you talk about aid to Ukraine, he's introduced the loan lease concept, which is [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=121.19999999999999s)]
*  a really important one and I think has a lot of consensus, as well as these other ideas, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=125.6s)]
*  the repo act, which we've discussed, which is seizing the assets of corrupt Russian oligarchs [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=129.92s)]
*  to help pay for this resistance. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=135.56s)]
*  I think these are ideas that I think can get consensus, and that's what we've been working [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=137.2s)]
*  through. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=141.12s)]
*  We'll send our package, we'll put something together and send it to the Senate and get [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=142.12s)]
*  these obligations completed. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=145.28s)]
*  Are you expecting the Biden administration to respond to Iran's aggression? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=147.4s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=155.8s)]
*  Look, I do think that we showed resolve last night, thankfully. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=156.8s)]
*  Many of us were concerned about that, to stand with our ally Israel. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=160.84s)]
*  It's critically important to do that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=163.96s)]
*  We took down most of those drones and missiles, as you noted, and our other allies stepped [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=165.23999999999998s)]
*  up as well. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=169.67999999999998s)]
*  What's important right now is that we stand with Israel. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=170.67999999999998s)]
*  We should not be dictating to them what their policy is. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=173.04s)]
*  We certainly shouldn't be doing what Chuck Schumer did, trying to suggest they should [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=175.56s)]
*  have new elections at this critical time. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=179.76s)]
*  They're fighting for their very existence, and it's never been more important for us [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  to be there with them, and we are resolved to do that. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=185.07999999999998s)]
*  I hope that continues. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=187.32s)]
*  Understood. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=188.32s)]
*  And this weekend, as you said, you were with President Trump. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=189.32s)]
*  The former president had a public show of support for you and your agenda. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=191.92s)]
*  Here's President Trump with you on Friday. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=197.0s)]
*  Let's take a listen. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=198.83999999999997s)]
*  It's not an easy situation for any speaker. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=199.83999999999997s)]
*  I think he's doing a very good job. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=204.67999999999998s)]
*  He's doing about as good as you're going to do, and I'm sure that Marjorie understands [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=206.16s)]
*  that. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=212.39999999999998s)]
*  And of course, he's referring to Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has threatened to come [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=213.67999999999998s)]
*  up with the motion to vacate because she's upset that the Republicans have yet to secure [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=218.64s)]
*  the border. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=224.79999999999998s)]
*  Here's the Georgia congresswoman with me two weeks ago here. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=225.79999999999998s)]
*  Speaker Johnson really wanted to secure the border like he promised all of us he would [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=230.64s)]
*  and promised the American people that he would have told Chuck Schumer, we will not pass [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=235.23999999999998s)]
*  any government funding bills until our border and funding bills have the H.R.2 in it or [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=239.88s)]
*  the Lake and Riley Act or at least some measures within them. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=246.64000000000001s)]
*  But he didn't. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=250.32s)]
*  He completely failed in that. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=251.32s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, why bring a bill to the floor to send money to Ukraine without having secured [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=255.0s)]
*  the border? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=259.92s)]
*  So Maria, what Marjorie fails to notice is that we have been fighting on the border. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=262.68s)]
*  We fight on it every day. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=266.56s)]
*  We passed our comprehensive border security package, H.R.2, at the very beginning of this [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=267.74s)]
*  Congress. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=272.04s)]
*  It's been sitting on Chuck Schumer's desk. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=273.04s)]
*  We passed all the resolutions. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=274.36s)]
*  We passed these acts out of the House and they get stopped in the Senate. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=275.68s)]
*  See, the open borders Democrats control the Senate and the White House, obviously. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=279.32s)]
*  So we've not been able to have a lawmaking exercise to meet that critical objective. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  But we're fighting every day. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=287.8s)]
*  That's why we've been demanding that President Biden use his executive authority to seal [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=289.08s)]
*  that border. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=292.64s)]
*  President Trump reiterated that demand at our press conference together on Friday. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  We need the White House to step up. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=297.8s)]
*  In the meantime, Congress has to fulfill its obligations. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=299.48s)]
*  If we had shut the government down, Maria, in that appropriations process, that would [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=302.24s)]
*  have been on us. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=306.16s)]
*  Because, remember, the White House controls the pain that's inflicted on the American [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=307.16s)]
*  people when the government shuts down. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=310.8s)]
*  Imagine TSA agents not being paid and flights being canceled for Americans. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=313.04s)]
*  Imagine Border Patrol agents not being paid and those open borders, the responsibility [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=316.8s)]
*  for that being shifted to us. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=321.44s)]
*  Imagine troops not being paid at this dangerous time. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=322.92s)]
*  So that simply wasn't an option for us. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=324.84000000000003s)]
*  It would have reflected badly on us and it would not have been helpful in our mission [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=327.88s)]
*  to grow, keep and grow the House majority, win back the Senate and win back the White [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=331.64s)]
*  House for President Trump so that we can save this country. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=335.92s)]
*  That's what's at stake right now. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=338.76s)]
*  And the party is 100 percent united on that agenda. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=339.76s)]
*  Is there any path to securing the border under Joe Biden? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=342.72s)]
*  Well, that's the thing. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=347.32s)]
*  He has Section 212-F authority under federal law. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=349.52s)]
*  He has seven or eight different options under federal law, existing authority to do, frankly, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=352.28s)]
*  what President Trump did. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=356.96s)]
*  President Trump got control of that border because he was a strong leader. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=358.4s)]
*  So we've been demanding of the White House in all of these negotiations to do your job, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=361.32s)]
*  secure the border. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=365.15999999999997s)]
*  Maria, you and I both know nine million encounters officially at the southern border since Joe [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=366.15999999999997s)]
*  Biden took office. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=370.59999999999997s)]
*  We've got two million guideways, three hundred forty plus suspects on the terrorism watch [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=371.59999999999997s)]

*  Is he also with you on FISA because they spied on his campaign? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=465.36s)]

*  I want to get your take on this surveillance tool because you said you changed your mind [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=472.88s)]
*  on attaching an amendment which included a warrant needed to spy on American citizens. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=478.2s)]
*  You said you changed your mind after getting a classified briefing. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=484.52s)]
*  Can you tell us what changed your mind in terms of an amendment where you need a warrant [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=487.84s)]
*  to spy on Americans? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=493.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, the president and I agree on the necessity of the uses of FISA. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=495.76s)]
*  Remember, that's how we killed terrorists. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=500.12s)]
*  That's how we stopped terrorist plots on US soil. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=501.84s)]
*  had another 9-11 since that terrible tragedy. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=505.28s)]
*  President Trump used it and he reauthorized it in 2018 for six years and that's why it's [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=508.79999999999995s)]
*  up again. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=512.56s)]
*  What we did was we changed the bill to fit his requirements and ours and that is that [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=513.56s)]
*  it would expire now, two years from now, in the middle of his next administration. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=517.1999999999999s)]
*  So he's the one that gets to determine if it's working well. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=521.48s)]
*  It's a critical tool to stop terrorism. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=524.22s)]
*  The whole point of the law is that we surveil foreign persons, foreign terrorists, but the [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=526.8s)]
*  reason the warrant requirement is not helpful and the reason that people that we love and [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=531.58s)]
*  respect like Mike Pompeo and John Ratcliffe and Robert O'Brien and Devin Nunes who have [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=535.74s)]
*  been in the intelligence community and our guys, our conservatives who came off Judiciary [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=540.34s)]
*  Committee, a couple of them, they said you can't put the warrant on this. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=545.2s)]
*  Here's what happens, quick scenarios. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=549.22s)]
*  This is important for people to understand, Maria. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=550.64s)]
*  If we're surveilling a terrorist in the Middle East and the terrorist sends an email to a [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=552.6600000000001s)]
*  guy named John Smith in any town USA and the email says the components will be delivered [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=556.7s)]
*  to your house this afternoon for further assembly and delivery to the high school stadium during [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=561.5799999999999s)]
*  the game, okay? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=566.26s)]
*  I think every American would want the analyst who saw that email from that foreign terrorist [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=567.26s)]
*  to do a query of the other communications between those two persons. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=572.5s)]
*  That is not unlawful and that must continue. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=577.2199999999999s)]
*  If that analyst had to get a warrant before that, it would add a huge time delay. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=579.54s)]
*  The courts are not set up to be able to handle all that volume and Americans may die. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=583.88s)]
*  We want to look at those emails and find out, my goodness, which high school stadium, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=589.3s)]
*  what time and is this a bomb and what are the components? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=592.62s)]
*  We have to continue that to save American lives. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=595.18s)]
*  That's what's at stake. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=598.0799999999999s)]
*  This is not searches on American citizens. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=599.0799999999999s)]
*  If they were going to search John Smith, they would have to go get a warrant to do anything [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=602.4799999999999s)]
*  else. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=606.66s)]
*  But this is lawfully collected data under Section 702 and it must continue. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=607.66s)]
*  So real quick before you go, you talked with President Trump on Friday about ensuring a [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=610.54s)]
*  transparent and safe election. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=614.5799999999999s)]
*  You talked about the SAVE Act where you want to ensure that illegals are not voting in [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=616.9s)]
*  this election. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=622.26s)]
*  Do you have any evidence that the Democrats are pushing for illegals to vote in this [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=623.5s)]
*  election? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=627.4599999999999s)]
*  Well, listen, some of them have admitted it to us even on record in Judiciary Committee [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=628.4599999999999s)]
*  hearings that they want illegals to vote. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=633.42s)]
*  They've allowed it in some municipal elections. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=635.18s)]
*  What Congress has control over is federal elections. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=637.36s)]
*  We have to do every single thing we can to secure that our elections are free and fair. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=639.54s)]
*  One thing we need to do, and this is what we're about to, the House Republicans are [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=645.42s)]
*  about to enter legislation into the record that will ensure that no illegal can vote [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=648.34s)]
*  in a federal election. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=653.72s)]
*  You have to prove you're a citizen instead of, as the law currently states, just checking [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=654.98s)]
*  a box to say it. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=659.46s)]
*  Maria, we have so many illegals in the country. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=660.46s)]
*  They could tilt the election if this happened. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=662.62s)]
*  If just one in a hundred illegals decided to vote in a federal election, it could swing [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=664.14s)]
*  congressional races and it might even swing presidential elections. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=668.88s)]
*  You could talk about hundreds of thousands of votes potentially. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=672.78s)]
*  So we have to do everything possible to make sure that this election is secure. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=675.22s)]
*  It's a number one priority to the American people. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=679.6600000000001s)]
*  Ms. Speaker, thanks very much for being here this morning. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=681.5s)]
*  We so appreciate your time. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxz2Xwmt_g&t=683.58s)]
