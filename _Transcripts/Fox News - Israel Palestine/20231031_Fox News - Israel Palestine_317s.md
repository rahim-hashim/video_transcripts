# Biden admin does not have a strategy: Lt. Col. Oliver North
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek)
*  Here with reaction, Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North is with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=0.0s)]
*  Colonel, you know what? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=3.4s)]
*  You fought in Vietnam. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=5.44s)]
*  You were in Afghanistan. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=7.36s)]
*  You were in Iraq. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=8.36s)]
*  You are proud of the fact that you have spent your life with heroes. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=10.28s)]
*  You are one of them. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=13.66s)]
*  In my lifetime, I can't think of a time that it's been this dangerous. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=15.5s)]
*  And I'm including the Cold War here. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=19.72s)]
*  And my dad spent four years in the Pacific. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=21.94s)]
*  The threat of, I think, real world chaos and a possible world war is moreâ€”I think that's [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=24.82s)]
*  more possible than at any point in my lifetime. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=30.42s)]
*  Am I wrong? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=32.620000000000005s)]
*  No. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=33.620000000000005s)]
*  In fact, what we just heard from the vice president a few moments ago, the strategy [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=34.620000000000005s)]
*  is don't. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=41.06s)]
*  Don't is not a strategy. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=42.06s)]
*  You and I were together last week, and we offered advice on how the Biden administration [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=45.5s)]
*  could deter Iran from starting a multi-front war on our ally Israel. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=49.9s)]
*  As yet, none of that's been done. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=55.46s)]
*  And so tonight, a little bit more free advice for the Biden administration. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=57.54s)]
*  How to solve the problem of freeing more than 230 American, Israeli, French, German, Italian, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=62.6s)]
*  Egyptian and other nationalities held hostage by Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=68.62s)]
*  Mr. Biden ought to go on national TV and announce he has conferred with Israeli Prime [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=74.7s)]
*  Minister Netanyahu and ordered the immediate deployment of the 1,000-bed hospital ship [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=79.7s)]
*  USNS Comfort from Norfolk, Virginia, to station it 13 miles off the coast of Gaza, adjacent [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=85.02s)]
*  to the Ra'afah Crossing, which is the only place people can get in and out of Gaza, as [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=92.46s)]
*  long as President al-Sisi allows them to. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=99.86s)]
*  Right now, it's still closed. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=104.06s)]
*  Look, it's just north of the border crossing in the Sinai, Egypt. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=105.82000000000001s)]
*  As about al-Sigal is a place where you could station that vessel off that shore. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=112.74000000000001s)]
*  The USNS Comfort will be available to treat Palestinian women and children in need of [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=120.22s)]
*  medical care. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=125.48s)]
*  Mr. Biden needs to call President Abdullah al-Fattah al-Sisi and invite him to allow [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=127.62s)]
*  the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit to utilize the port at Asbet al-Baghshakal and the Al-Aarish [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=136.18s)]
*  International Airport in Sinai that we have used to support the International United Nations [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=144.22s)]
*  monitoring operation out there and establish a triage there for processing the transporting [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=151.78s)]
*  of the sick and injured and infirm Palestinian women and children out to the USNS Comfort [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=158.3s)]
*  for medical treatment. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=163.42000000000002s)]
*  Our Navy and Marines have the Helos, the MV-22s, and the experience of ship-to-shore vessels [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=165.14000000000001s)]
*  and movement necessary for this task. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=171.58s)]
*  He should also direct Secretary of State Blinken to notify representatives of the government [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=174.18s)]
*  of Qatar to inform Hamas with whom they are in direct contact. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=179.28s)]
*  We expect that for every five Palestinian women and children treated aboard the hospital [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=185.0s)]
*  ship, at least one hostage will be released each time. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=190.16s)]
*  There are, of course, many details to be worked out on this kind of humanitarian mission. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=194.64s)]
*  The sea transit from Norfolk to Gaza is about 5,500 miles. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=199.46s)]
*  In about 20 knots, the hospital ship could be on station in less than 14 days. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=205.67999999999998s)]
*  By then, details can be ironed out so that this lifesaving endeavor can get underway. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=209.84s)]
*  I can almost assure you that there's nobody who wants to do such a thing in this administration, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=215.2s)]
*  but they should. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=220.16s)]
*  And we ought to assure Prime Minister Netanyahu this is not being done to stop the IDF from [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=221.16s)]
*  continuing their counterattack on Hamas terrorists who murdered 1,400 Israelis on October 7. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=226.54s)]
*  Al Sisi must be convinced to invite the U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Navy mission ashore [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=233.48s)]
*  in the Sinai coast. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=238.64s)]
*  We ought to assure leaders of Israel and Egypt that we will provide accurate identity information [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=240.48s)]
*  to the International Red Cross and the Red Crescent for every Palestinian flown out to [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=245.83999999999997s)]
*  the hospital ship. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=250.48s)]
*  Now, what's going to happen to the Palestinian civilians after their medical treatment? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=251.64s)]
*  That can be worked out. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=255.7s)]
*  It's the kind of thing that people ought to want to do. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=256.7s)]
*  The positive information management of this humanitarian effort should help prove to [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=259.74s)]
*  those instigating those pro-Hamas protests you just had on the screen on college campuses [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=264.58000000000004s)]
*  around the world that America, Israel and Egypt can act to protect innocent human life [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=270.34000000000003s)]
*  in the midst of war. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=276.22s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=277.26000000000005s)]
*  I want to save them, but I'll add one thing, Colonel. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=278.48s)]
*  Your idea is a great idea. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=281.3s)]
*  They want lights back on. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=283.54s)]
*  They want self-service. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=284.66s)]
*  They want any sort of humanitarian assistance at all, which I'm skeptical of. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=286.58s)]
*  They've got to release every hostage. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=291.65999999999997s)]
*  That's it. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=293.78s)]
*  Otherwise, Israel must defend its homeland. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=294.78s)]
*  Colonel, we appreciate you more than you know. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=296.94s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=298.97999999999996s)]
*  You know, I'm saying, Israel's got to continue to do that. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-sp83jngek&t=299.97999999999996s)]
