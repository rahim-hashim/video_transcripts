# Israel hunts for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA)
*  Well, Hamas throwing cold water on hostage talks with Israel, dashing any hopes of freedom [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=0.0s)]
*  for those still held in captivity and the prospect of a temporary truce for their own [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=5.4s)]
*  citizens. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=10.56s)]
*  Now, rocket sirens are sounding across Israel as the Iranian-backed terror group fires a [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=11.56s)]
*  salvo towards the Jewish state today. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=16.02s)]
*  Trey Yanks is live in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=19.26s)]
*  He has the latest for us. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=20.68s)]
*  Hi, Trey. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=22.64s)]
*  Hey, Dana, good morning. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=24.2s)]
*  And earlier today, Hamas firing more rockets toward Israel's second largest city of Tel [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=26.36s)]
*  Aviv. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=30.96s)]
*  More than 300,000 people here heading to bomb shelters. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=31.96s)]
*  Seventy-six days into this conflict, the factions still have maintained their ability to fire [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=35.92s)]
*  these salvos toward major population centers. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=40.8s)]
*  It does come as Hamas has publicly rejected Israeli discussion about a new ceasefire. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=44.3s)]
*  Hamas saying that no hostages will be released until the war is officially over. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=49.92s)]
*  Now, that's what they're saying publicly. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=54.440000000000005s)]
*  Privately, they have a different tune. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=56.120000000000005s)]
*  Just yesterday, Ismael Chania, the leader of Hamas, flew to Egypt where he continued [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=58.56s)]
*  conversations about a possible deal. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=63.88s)]
*  It does come as Israeli forces say they are close to completing high-intensity ground [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=66.2s)]
*  operations in northern Gaza. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=70.22s)]
*  Much of the focus for soldiers over the past day has been in the Jabalia neighborhood where [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=72.4s)]
*  the Israelis say troops from the 551st Brigade evacuated a group of civilians still in a [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=76.4s)]
*  building. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=81.88000000000001s)]
*  With more difficult ground battles taking place in southern Gaza, the death toll is [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=82.88000000000001s)]
*  rising among Israeli soldiers with a total of 137 killed since the ground operation began. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  Former Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danone, said this to Fox News about [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=92.88000000000001s)]
*  the possibility of a ceasefire. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=97.24000000000001s)]
*  That is why we cannot agree to a ceasefire now. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  And you see the voices coming from the UN, pressure on the US. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=103.72s)]
*  Because a ceasefire now will keep Hamas alive. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=106.72s)]
*  It will allow themselves to reconstruct their abilities and they will become heroes. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=110.24s)]
*  That should be a symbol that when you come against a democracy and you try to terrorize [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  it, that is your last mistake. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=118.96s)]
*  That's what will happen to Hamas in Gaza. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=120.88s)]
*  The fighting inside Gaza comes as activity continues to increase on Israel's northern [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=125.47999999999999s)]
*  front. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=129.56s)]
*  Overnight, Israeli strikes against southern Lebanon were more serious after new attacks [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=130.56s)]
*  by the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=134.04s)]
*  The attacks against American forces are also increasing across the Middle East in both Iraq and Syria. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=137.36s)]
*  Overnight, a rocket attack against the Al-Assad air base brought the total number to 102 since [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=141.36s)]
*  mid-October. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=147.20000000000002s)]
*  The region clearly on the brink of a much broader conflict and that's part of the reason [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=148.44000000000003s)]
*  over the past week you've seen American officials visiting here in Tel Aviv to meet with their [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=152.36s)]
*  Israeli counterparts and prepare for the future. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=156.76000000000002s)]
*  Dana? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=159.16000000000003s)]
*  Troy Yanks, thank you for the update. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=160.16000000000003s)]
*  So I want to bring in Hugh Dugan, a former hostage affairs envoy. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=161.76000000000002s)]
*  Sir, good morning to you. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=165.16s)]
*  I want you to listen to Antony Blinken. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=166.16s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  Hamas wants a ceasefire. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=168.92000000000002s)]
*  That's what they want first. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=170.56s)]
*  Well, here's Blinken putting the finger on Hamas. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=171.56s)]
*  This is something we'd very much like to see happen. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=174.8s)]
*  The problem was and has been and remains Hamas. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=177.32s)]
*  I know that Israel would welcome and I think the world would welcome. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=180.04s)]
*  What gives or is this just part of a wicked negotiation? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=183.88s)]
*  Sir, can you hear me okay? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=188.04000000000002s)]
*  Yes, this is. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=192.4s)]
*  This is. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=193.4s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  Good morning, Bill. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=195.48000000000002s)]
*  Hamas' sick tactic throughout this process is to invoke as much humanitarian damage as [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=196.48000000000002s)]
*  possible so that ultimately it can win on the battlefield of public opinion so as to [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=201.8s)]
*  dispel Israel and the region once and for all. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=207.52s)]
*  So that's its final goal is to dispel Israel. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=210.04000000000002s)]
*  Hamas is not in this war for the usual reasons to seek land, people, wealth. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=212.52s)]
*  Its sole goal is to eliminate Israel. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=218.36s)]
*  And I think all of these tactics we see with one side of Hamas, one wing saying it wants [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=220.6s)]
*  to get something going, the other side saying nothing until the war is over, it shows their [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=225.07999999999998s)]
*  disarray, but it feeds into their ultimate objective is to create confusion long enough [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=229.44s)]
*  to evoke as much humanitarian damage and pin it on Israel's future. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  This whole quest about a ceasefire, why not grant that? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=238.51999999999998s)]
*  Say you know, we'll do it for 10 or 12 hours because the Israelis are looking for 40 hostages [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=243.92s)]
*  to come home. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=249.86s)]
*  And these are women and their children and their elderly males. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=250.86s)]
*  And you know those men need help in addition to the women. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=256.1s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=260.98s)]
*  It's sickening. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=262.5s)]
*  And meanwhile, Hamas is saying no deal until the war is over. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=263.5s)]
*  The only way that this war is over is not through a simple ceasefire. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=268.42s)]
*  It's with a simple cease terrorism. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=272.1s)]
*  Nobody wants terrorism in the world except terrorists. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=274.66s)]
*  They are choreographing the world theater for damage for their own influence. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=278.58s)]
*  So the terms of trade that they ultimately want to see is no war. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=283.26s)]
*  Then maybe we'll talk, oh, by the way, we want 8,000 Palestinian prisoners out of Israel [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=287.21999999999997s)]
*  for about 100 hostages. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=292.53999999999996s)]
*  That's not sensible. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=295.85999999999996s)]
*  I'm here in Milwaukee today. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=296.85999999999996s)]
*  President Biden is here to explain Bidenomics. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=298.9s)]
*  He really this year needs to explain why are Americans still held in hostage in, by Hamas [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=301.78s)]
*  two months into this. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=309.02s)]
*  This is going to turn out to be his Carter era hostage headache going into this election [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=310.58s)]
*  year more than Bidenomics itself. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=314.9s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=316.94s)]
*  That is a very interesting comment. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=317.94s)]
*  Sometimes you wonder why you don't get more of those questions out there with the White [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=319.53999999999996s)]
*  House press corps. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=321.86s)]
*  But that is what it is for the moment here. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=322.86s)]
*  We may see the White House a bit later this afternoon. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=325.65999999999997s)]
*  This is Yair Sinwar. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=328.52s)]
*  He was in Israeli prisons for 20 years. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=331.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=334.71999999999997s)]
*  He's running the militant wing of Hamas. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=336.12s)]
*  By all accounts, he's still alive. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=339.59999999999997s)]
*  And by all accounts, he's still in Gaza. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=342.35999999999996s)]
*  Can you explain to us why it is so difficult to locate this individual? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=344.76s)]
*  This individual was locatable until he was released under a previous hostage swap deal [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=352.12s)]
*  a few years ago. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=357.70000000000005s)]
*  That's the danger of letting these Palestinians out of prison in Israel because they go right [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=358.70000000000005s)]
*  back to the front and they end up commanding with a vengeance the type of persecution of [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=363.72s)]
*  Israel and theatrics on the world stage that can unsettle not just a region but broader. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=368.86s)]
*  It's hard to find him. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=375.90000000000003s)]
*  There's a fog of war. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=376.90000000000003s)]
*  It's a very complicated situation. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=379.18s)]
*  Hostages are their own war. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=381.70000000000005s)]
*  And here, they're a war within a war, the region which has undergone tension for decades. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=383.04s)]
*  We need to find this person. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=388.48s)]
*  Apparently, there are two wings in the Hamas organization, the militant wing in the field [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=389.92s)]
*  and the political wing sitting comfortably in Doha. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=394.24s)]
*  But they're the same bird. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=397.88s)]
*  We need to find this bird and take care of it once and for all. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=399.18s)]
*  Yeah, I believe the number was 121, I think, earlier in the week, right around that number [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCprz_bwIIA&t=402.08000000000004s)]
