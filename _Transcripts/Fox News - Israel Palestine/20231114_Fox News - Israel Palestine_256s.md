# Speaker Johnson addresses 'March for Israel' rally: America stands 'unequivocally' with Israel
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7k57H2_2c)
*  Well, it is so good to be with you all. What an extraordinary crowd. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7k57H2_2c&t=0.0s)]
*  And it was organized in just a few days. It's amazing. Amazing. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7k57H2_2c&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  There are few issues in Washington that could so easily bring together leaders of both parties in both chambers. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7k57H2_2c&t=9.8s)]
*  But the survival of the State of Israel and her people unites us together. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7k57H2_2c&t=16.5s)]
*  And it unites all Americans. All Americans. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7k57H2_2c&t=20.6s)]
*  Let me be very clear. The United States stands unequivocally with our neighbor, our friend, our ally Israel. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7k57H2_2c&t=24.0s)]
*  They are neighbors in a global sense. That's right. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7k57H2_2c&t=33.0s)]
*  Last week, a bipartisan group of members stood in solidarity on the steps of the House to mourn the lost lives in the October 7th attack [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7k57H2_2c&t=38.0s)]
*  and to grieve with the families of Israeli hostages that are still being held in Gaza. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7k57H2_2c&t=46.0s)]
*  We heard heartbreaking and tragic accounts of their kidnappings. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7k57H2_2c&t=50.0s)]
*  And of course, as you know, many of those families haven't received an update on their well-being since that day. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7k57H2_2c&t=53.0s)]
*  As a parent myself, I can begin to comprehend their despair. All of us feel that way. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7k57H2_2c&t=58.0s)]
*  This morning we watched the horrific film that was produced by Hamas from their own cameras as they committed the assault. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7k57H2_2c&t=63.0s)]
*  It's unspeakable. The auditorium was full of Republicans and Democrats in the House. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7k57H2_2c&t=71.0s)]
*  And they wept as we watched the film together. Most couldn't sit through it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7k57H2_2c&t=76.0s)]
*  These Israeli hostages were kidnapped in their homes by barbaric Hamas terrorists for simply being Jewish and living in Israel. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7k57H2_2c&t=80.0s)]
*  As Prime Minister Netanyahu says so well, this is a fight between good and evil, between light and darkness, between civilization and barbarism. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7k57H2_2c&t=87.0s)]
*  The calls for a ceasefire are outrageous. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7k57H2_2c&t=101.0s)]
*  The calls for a ceasefire are outrageous. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7k57H2_2c&t=106.0s)]
*  The calls for a ceasefire are outrageous. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7k57H2_2c&t=110.0s)]
*  The calls for a ceasefire are outrageous. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7k57H2_2c&t=113.0s)]
*  We stand with you in that. Hamas terrorists waged the bloodiest assault on Jewish lives since the Holocaust. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7k57H2_2c&t=127.0s)]
*  And there are hundreds of hostages, many of them Americans, still stuck inside Gaza. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7k57H2_2c&t=132.0s)]
*  Israel will cease their counteroffensive when Hamas ceases to be a threat to the Jewish state. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7k57H2_2c&t=137.0s)]
*  But Hamas' genocidal and anti-Semitic rhetoric isn't just confined to Gaza, as you know. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7k57H2_2c&t=149.0s)]
*  The war in Israel has awakened an alarming amount of anti-Semitism towards Jewish people here in the United States and across the globe. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7k57H2_2c&t=155.0s)]
*  From the halls of Congress to college campuses, this rise of anti-Semitism must be stopped. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7k57H2_2c&t=162.0s)]
*  We've heard many echo the Hamas rallying cry of From the River to the Sea. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7k57H2_2c&t=173.0s)]
*  And I'm convinced that a lot of these college students that are engaging in these protests do not understand. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7k57H2_2c&t=176.0s)]
*  That is an explicit call for the extermination of Israel. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7k57H2_2c&t=181.0s)]
*  It is happening daily in our country, as you know, and it is unacceptable for Jewish Americans to feel unsafe at home. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7k57H2_2c&t=189.0s)]
*  It is unacceptable for Jewish businesses to face violence, vandalism, and threats. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7k57H2_2c&t=194.0s)]
*  It is unacceptable for universities to allow Hamas apologists to assault and accost Jewish students on campus. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7k57H2_2c&t=199.0s)]
*  It is unacceptable for any political leader in this nation to give credence to this dangerous rhetoric. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7k57H2_2c&t=211.0s)]
*  We can and we must do more to stand with our great ally and friend. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7k57H2_2c&t=220.0s)]
*  It is my hope that this gathering today serves as a reminder to the entire world, but also to those within our own borders, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7k57H2_2c&t=224.0s)]
*  that the United States stands proudly with Israel and the Jewish people forever. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7k57H2_2c&t=231.0s)]
*  Thank you for allowing us to be a part of this. God bless you. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7k57H2_2c&t=241.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7k57H2_2c&t=254.0s)]
