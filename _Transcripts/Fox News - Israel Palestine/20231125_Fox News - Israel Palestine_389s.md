# Israeli spokesperson provides update on Hamas delaying second hostage release
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ)
*  And for the latest on the hostage releases and the possibility of an extension of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=0.0s)]
*  temporary ceasefire, let's bring in Israeli government spokesman Eilon Levy. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  Eilon, thank you so much for being with us. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=8.8s)]
*  I want to get straight to this new reporting about this delay in the releases. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=11.16s)]
*  Hamas is giving sort of conflicting reasons according to two different reports on why [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=17.0s)]
*  this is happening. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=22.28s)]
*  Reuters is reporting that Hamas is delaying until Israel will commit to allowing aid trucks [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=23.28s)]
*  into northern Gaza. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=28.439999999999998s)]
*  Then you've got Axios saying that Hamas is claiming that Israel violated its terms in [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  imposing some restrictions or I guess conditions on who is released from the Palestinian prisoners. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=35.4s)]
*  Can you just tell us what is the cause of this delay? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=44.28s)]
*  We're not going to comment on sensitive issues relating to the hostages until they are safely [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  back on Israeli soil. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=52.16s)]
*  Human lives hang in the balance. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  This is of course a very perilous moment, but it's important to be clear. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=55.44s)]
*  Every moment that Hamas has kept onto those hostages since October 7th, every moment it [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=59.8s)]
*  holds them in the dark and their families in the dark is an ongoing crime against humanity. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=64.6s)]
*  Hamas could have released those hostages now. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=70.44s)]
*  Hamas could have released them yesterday. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=72.36s)]
*  Hamas could have released them on October 7th and it never had to abduct children from [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  their beds in the first place. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=77.36s)]
*  And we're demanding that Hamas continue to return the hostages and we're insistent that [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=79.0s)]
*  we will continue putting military pressure on Hamas to release the rest of the hostages [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=83.24s)]
*  after the completion of the first stage of the agreement that we hope will be seen through [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=88.24s)]
*  because it is only military pressure that is going to bring Hamas to bear and force [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=92.91999999999999s)]
*  it to bring back the hostages. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=97.44s)]
*  It hasn't suddenly decided to be nice. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=98.91999999999999s)]
*  In fact, it's showing that it is continuing to psychologically terrorize the people of [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=100.84s)]
*  Israel every minute it holds onto our children and those hostages. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  I hear you on that point, but, sir, for folks who are expecting their loved ones to come [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=109.2s)]
*  home today and then they hear about this delay, should there be any concern that this agreement [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=114.04s)]
*  is coming off the rails? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=118.44s)]
*  We are insisting that this go through. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=120.92s)]
*  We are demanding that and we hope to see those people back. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=123.2s)]
*  Again, this is a sensitive evolving situation and I can't comment on anything that may jeopardize [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=126.76s)]
*  the state of those hostages. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=131.24s)]
*  But of course, the torment for the families, 50 days now that their loved ones, their children, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=133.4s)]
*  their wives, their grandmothers have been kept in Hamas, in Hamas captivity, has been [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=138.72s)]
*  absolutely torturing for them and we're demanding that those people be returned. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=144.08s)]
*  We hope that Hamas will honor its side of the agreement as well. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=148.64s)]
*  We know this is an organization that is completely ruthless and inhumane and we saw the atrocities [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=151.96s)]
*  it perpetrated on October 7th and has continued to perpetrate since then. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=157.16s)]
*  So we're not expecting it to keep its word out of the sense of honor, but we are demanding [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=160.92s)]
*  that it comply with that agreement and we'll continue putting military pressure until we [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=165.96s)]
*  get all of our hostages back, not just 10, not just 20, all of them back. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  Just to clarify, when you talk about continuing military pressure, are you suggesting that [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=175.0s)]
*  this pause in fighting may be lifted, that the fighting could resume unless Hamas follows [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=180.24s)]
*  through on its commitment to allow these hostages out? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=186.52s)]
*  The fighting will resume eventually. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  The question is when. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=191.6s)]
*  The agreement at the moment is for a four-day hostage release pause in exchange for the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=192.79999999999998s)]
*  first 50 hostages, women and children. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=196.96s)]
*  We're hopeful that can be extended by an additional day for every 10 hostages Hamas releases, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=199.24s)]
*  but it takes two to tango and Hamas has to honor the terms of that agreement. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=204.51999999999998s)]
*  It must release those women and children. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=208.35999999999999s)]
*  We will accept nothing less. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=210.4s)]
*  Or else the pause will be unpaused? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=212.2s)]
*  Or else let's see what happens now and let's hope that we get those women and children [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  back tonight. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=221.96s)]
*  Why is it that you think Americans are not among the first to be released? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=222.96s)]
*  Is Hamas trying to use Americans as an additional point of leverage to try to maneuver Biden [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=227.20000000000002s)]
*  to pressure Israel in some way? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=232.28s)]
*  You know, I wish I could comment on what Hamas is thinking, but it's impossible to get in [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=235.28s)]
*  the minds of the sick monsters who would abduct a 10-month-old baby and hold it hostage, hold [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=238.68s)]
*  it for a ransom. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=245.56s)]
*  The sick monsters who did that and abducted children on a day when they burned, bedded, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=246.88s)]
*  raped so many people on October 7th are not thinking in a rational way. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=252.12s)]
*  They're not thinking through the lens of values that you or I would understand. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=256.32s)]
*  So when it comes to trying to analyze what Hamas is thinking, I would be at a loss. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=259.8s)]
*  There's this issue of proportionality. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=265.04s)]
*  I think it's three Palestinian prisoners for every one hostage. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=267.84s)]
*  How did we end up with those numbers? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=271.2s)]
*  We're in a very difficult situation at the moment. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=275.12s)]
*  Hamas is holding our children, it's holding Israeli babies, and we want them to get back. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=277.28s)]
*  Releasing violent criminals is not something that Israel ever wants to do. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=282.68s)]
*  It is a bitter pill we have had to swallow in order to facilitate the release of those [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=286.84s)]
*  women and children. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=290.8s)]
*  It's important to remember nearly half of the prisoners on that list who are slated [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=292.32s)]
*  for release are men. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=296.71999999999997s)]
*  They are males over the age of 18. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=298.47999999999996s)]
*  All of them are in jail at the moment on charges or convictions of violent offenses. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=301.48s)]
*  We're talking about attempted murder in some cases. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=306.8s)]
*  Stabbing attacks, shooting attacks, offenses involving explosives. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=309.6s)]
*  These are not random people who are taking from the streets. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=313.68s)]
*  These are violent criminals. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=316.12s)]
*  And last quick question because we're almost out of time. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=318.0s)]
*  Operationally, how much does this ceasefire, this temporary ceasefire, set Israel back [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=320.48s)]
*  in terms of completing its mission to eradicate Hamas? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=326.84s)]
*  We're going to continue putting unrelenting military pressure on Hamas, but certainly [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=330.96s)]
*  having four days in which the IDF itself can also recharge its batteries and reorganize [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=334.52s)]
*  it, get its act in order, but also put us in a stronger position in order to continue [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=339.15999999999997s)]
*  the fight ahead. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=343.68s)]
*  And this will continue until we get all of the hostages back. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=344.68s)]
*  There will be no one left behind. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=347.71999999999997s)]
*  And this war will end with the end of Hamas, as President Biden said yesterday at that [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=349.76s)]
*  press conference at Nantucket in response to the October 7th massacre. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=353.71999999999997s)]
*  A total destruction of Hamas is a legitimate Israeli military aim. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=357.84s)]
*  And we're thankful for the United States standing shoulder to shoulder with us as we face that [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=361.67999999999995s)]
*  very difficult task. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=365.44s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=366.44s)]
*  Alon Levy, thank you so much for your time. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=367.44s)]
*  Really appreciate it. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=369.64s)]
*  Take care. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=370.64s)]
*  Right now. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIFif9HRIhQ&t=387.84s)]
