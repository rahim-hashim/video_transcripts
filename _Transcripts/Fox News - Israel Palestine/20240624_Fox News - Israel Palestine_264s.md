# Jack Keane: Netanyahu cannot let Hezbollah redefine Israelâ€™s border
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [June 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo)
*  That's Israel striking Hezbollah targets across the border in Lebanon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=0.0s)]
*  This is Benjamin Netanyahu says the IDF now is winding down the current phase of its operations [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=4.64s)]
*  inside Gaza. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=9.88s)]
*  Meanwhile, tens of thousands of Israelis are calling for an end to the fighting and the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=11.44s)]
*  return of all hostages still held by Hamas. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=15.6s)]
*  Netanyahu says he is not ready to completely pull his forces just yet. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=19.0s)]
*  Listen. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=24.16s)]
*  I'm not prepared to end the war and leave Hamas in place. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=25.16s)]
*  I'm prepared to do a partial deal. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=30.0s)]
*  That's no secret. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=32.36s)]
*  That would return some of the people to us. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=33.36s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=35.56s)]
*  So he's not going to pack up wholesale IDF operations and withdraw from Gaza. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=36.56s)]
*  General Keen, if you were advising the Israeli prime minister right now, what would you tell [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=41.6s)]
*  him his next best move, next immediate step is? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=47.08s)]
*  Well, he has to continue to clear operations in Rafa. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=52.32s)]
*  He's rendered two of the four battalions there ineffective. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=57.36s)]
*  He's got a couple more that he's trying to degrade. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  Some of the forces in Rafa, like in other parts of Gaza, they have moved out of the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=64.44s)]
*  way of the Israelis because they want to preserve a certain element of the force. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=70.67999999999999s)]
*  So I think he's got to complete those clearing operations. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=75.24s)]
*  He knows full well that there are other organizations in Hanunis to the north of Rafa and further [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  north of that in Gaza City that over a period of weeks, he'll have to continue to conduct [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=85.56s)]
*  not major clearing operations, but more targeted raids to deal with the remnants of Hamas. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=91.42s)]
*  He doesn't want to leave a force in place that can regroup, reorganize, and at some [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=97.36s)]
*  point re-attack. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=102.68s)]
*  Meanwhile, as mentioned in the introduction, he knows full well that he's got a major problem [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=104.52s)]
*  with Hezbollah in Lebanon because there are 80,000 people who have evacuated from the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=111.24s)]
*  northern Israel homes that they've lived in. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=118.8s)]
*  And I think you have a map, we can show the audience what's going on here. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=121.36s)]
*  And what he's facing is the reality that he needs to return those 80,000 people to their [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=125.39999999999999s)]
*  homes. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=132.88s)]
*  And to do that, he has to move the forces that are moved into southern Lebanon. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=134.8s)]
*  Those are military-like forces. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=142.5s)]
*  They have close to 100,000 troops in the Hezbollah military. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=144.76s)]
*  That's not the right map for some reason. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=149.8s)]
*  But anyway, let me just talk through it. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=152.36s)]
*  There's a river that's north of the northern Israeli border, and it's called the Latani [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=155.8s)]
*  River. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=162.24s)]
*  And below that river is where most of the military forces are, and he has an operation [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=163.24s)]
*  to conduct there. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=170.26000000000002s)]
*  That is what he's going to focus on next. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=171.72s)]
*  He wants Hezbollah to withdraw those forces diplomatically. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=173.78s)]
*  And the Biden administration has been trying to work something like that for the last two [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  weeks. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=182.44s)]
*  It has not materialized. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=183.44s)]
*  If that doesn't happen, I don't believe Prime Minister Netanyahu has much choice. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=184.6s)]
*  He cannot let Hezbollah redefine the Israeli border, and that's just the facts of it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=189.44s)]
*  And that's what they've done right now, with 80,000 having moved away from it. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=196.48s)]
*  He wants those people to be able to return and return sovereignty to his border. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=200.84s)]
*  So his choices are conduct an air campaign very comprehensively to push Hezbollah back [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=205.74s)]
*  across the Latani River or do an air and ground campaign to accomplish much of the same. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=211.76000000000002s)]
*  This is very challenging. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=218.24s)]
*  These forces are much more formidable than Hamas. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  They got tens of thousands of rockets and missiles. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=222.68s)]
*  They will attempt to overwhelm the air defense system of Israel if this comprehensive attack [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=226.20000000000002s)]
*  takes place. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=231.28s)]
*  It will be a significant escalation in military activities if the Israelis have to push the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=232.72s)]
*  Hezbollah military away from the border. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=239.76s)]
*  General Keen, very insightful analysis from you as always. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=244.08s)]
*  Thank you for taking time with us this morning. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=248.6s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, thank you. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIv_gskNyQo&t=252.12s)]
