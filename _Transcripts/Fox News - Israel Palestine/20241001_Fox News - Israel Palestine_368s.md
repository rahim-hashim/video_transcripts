# IDF reports Iran launched missiles at Israel: BREAKING
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg)
*  This is breaking news right now, Harris, an Israeli military source telling Fox News that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=0.0s)]
*  a short while ago Iran launched missiles at Israel. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=5.38s)]
*  That is all the information that we have right now. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=9.58s)]
*  And I'm just going to read you again the text that I just received from this source. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=12.38s)]
*  It says, a short while ago, missiles were launched from Iran to Israel, an indication [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=16.1s)]
*  that those sirens that were sounding in the eastern part of this country certainly could [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=21.48s)]
*  have been from an Iranian missile. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=25.34s)]
*  But also an indication that, and just as we are talking here, sirens are sounding in [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=28.14s)]
*  Tel Aviv, in Jaffa, across this country. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=33.76s)]
*  A missile attack is underway as we are speaking, and we'll continue to stay live here and update [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=37.52s)]
*  you in real time as things are unfolding. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=42.58s)]
*  But again, the latest information that I have right now, according to a source in the Israeli [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=44.980000000000004s)]
*  military, a short while ago, Iran launched missiles at Israel, and as we speak, sirens [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=49.5s)]
*  are sounding across the central part of this country. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=56.42s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=58.379999999999995s)]
*  Tray, would you mind? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=59.379999999999995s)]
*  Tray, I just wanted to ask, with the reports that the Iranian attack was imminent, what [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=60.379999999999995s)]
*  imminent? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=65.98s)]
*  What did we have reports in terms of the United States? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=66.98s)]
*  As we know, there are fighter strike groups there, there are carrier strike groups. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=69.62s)]
*  We know that more troops were moved on Monday. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=73.16s)]
*  What happened to them? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=75.38s)]
*  Let me just, I'm going to answer a different question here, and I want to talk about what [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=77.38s)]
*  you just saw on your screen there. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=83.6s)]
*  Two things are happening right now. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=85.78s)]
*  First, I'm going to talk about what's happening here in Haifa in the northern part of the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=87.34s)]
*  country. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=90.14s)]
*  We can hear Israeli fighter jets overhead, and I'm watching on this live stream, you [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=91.14s)]
*  saw the camera point up to the sky there. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=95.74000000000001s)]
*  If Israel is intercepting ballistic missiles that are fired from Iran, they will not be [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=98.9s)]
*  using the Iron Dome. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=103.48s)]
*  The Iron Dome is reserved for smaller range rocket fire. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=104.86000000000001s)]
*  They will be using either David's Sling or more likely the Arrow 3 missile defense system. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=108.66000000000001s)]
*  The Arrow 3 was used back in April. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=115.14s)]
*  We were standing in Tel Aviv and we watched the missile defense take place in real time. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=117.46000000000001s)]
*  Some of the missiles were intercepted outside of Israeli territory by coalition forces. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=123.34s)]
*  Others made it to Israeli airspace and then were intercepted by Israel's missile defense [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=128.46s)]
*  system, the Arrow system. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=133.46s)]
*  The system was developed by a man named Danny Gold. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=135.28s)]
*  Now, Danny Gold is sort of the mastermind behind the Israeli defense arsenal. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=138.3s)]
*  He thought through how to intercept this fire coming from other countries. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=142.78s)]
*  The Israelis have been preparing for the possibility of what we are watching unfold today, a multi-front [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=147.38s)]
*  attack at the same time. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=153.3s)]
*  And over the past hour, hour and a half, the Israelis have seen rocket fire coming from [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=155.14s)]
*  Lebanon and they are now seeing missile fire coming from Iran. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=159.94s)]
*  So this is what we were talking about, Trey, just in terms of how many different fronts. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=163.66s)]
*  I had Congressman Brian Maston, who served with the IDF forces as an American citizen [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=168.66000000000003s)]
*  right at the start of this war after October 7th. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=175.10000000000002s)]
*  He had done it previously for years coming out of his college. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=177.42000000000002s)]
*  He said it was part of his personal journey. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=181.42000000000002s)]
*  And what he said was about these missiles, and you heard Ari say it too, there will be [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=184.62s)]
*  things that we haven't seen them necessarily use at all or maybe just not a lot. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=189.18s)]
*  And we remembered the compromise position, that the barrage of missiles on, you know, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=194.42s)]
*  following October 7th with Iran. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=201.78s)]
*  We saw the Iron Dome in need of some help. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=204.85999999999999s)]
*  And what you're saying is that at that time they did utilize the Arrow 3 missile defense system. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=208.57999999999998s)]
*  Do we know the capability, the restoration of the Iron Dome? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=215.01999999999998s)]
*  I know the United States was helping them to shore that up. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=218.26s)]
*  Wait, we've got something in the middle of the screen. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=221.26s)]
*  A Joe tray. What is it? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=223.34s)]
*  Come here. Walk out. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=224.94s)]
*  Good. Come here. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=226.5s)]
*  Yeah, we saw it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=229.22s)]
*  Come out to the balcony. Point out. Point up there. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=230.54000000000002s)]
*  Point up there. Point up. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=232.70000000000002s)]
*  Okay, you see straight to the sky. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=233.9s)]
*  Now, does the Iron Dome catch that? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=235.18s)]
*  Or is that a jet? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=236.82000000000002s)]
*  Make sure I'm connected here. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=239.58s)]
*  Do I still have you, Harris? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=241.42000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, you got us. We can see what you can see. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=242.54000000000002s)]
*  Tell your photographer he's doing a great job giving us eyes on this. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=244.62s)]
*  But what are we looking at? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=247.66000000000003s)]
*  Okay, so we don't know exactly what we're looking at here. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=249.82000000000002s)]
*  It looks like an interceptor. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=253.54000000000002s)]
*  It looks like an interceptor. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=254.62s)]
*  And again, just because we're seeing them from here [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=256.06s)]
*  doesn't mean they are targeting the city of Haifa. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=258.38s)]
*  But you could see that across your screen. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=260.82s)]
*  And it's going up again. Okay. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=264.78000000000003s)]
*  See from the skyline? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=266.18s)]
*  Okay, Randall, you're going to point to the skyline [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=267.18s)]
*  and just follow that the whole way up. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=268.66s)]
*  That right there is likely the Arrow defense system in action. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=270.1s)]
*  You are watching this unfold in real time. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=274.38s)]
*  And I'm going to talk to our security here [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=277.26000000000005s)]
*  and see if he can get me the location [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=278.78000000000003s)]
*  of where any of these ballistic missiles are headed. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=280.90000000000003s)]
*  Jerusalem, south. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=283.5s)]
*  I mean, I'm just going to hold this phone up. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=285.14000000000004s)]
*  Actually, let me just, in real time here, let's take a beat. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=288.22s)]
*  Okay, off the skyline here, Randall. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=291.1s)]
*  You see that coming up to the right? You're right there. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=292.58000000000004s)]
*  Yep, you got it. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=294.90000000000003s)]
*  Okay, and actually, yep, roll with that. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=296.26000000000005s)]
*  And now pan up to the left here. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=298.38000000000005s)]
*  You're going to see possibly an interception here. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=299.74s)]
*  Let's just wait. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=302.18s)]
*  Um, I can see off in the distance, too, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=303.62s)]
*  a number of other interceptions taking place. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=306.26s)]
*  I'm just currently, Harris, looking at a map [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=308.94s)]
*  of the red alerts that are sounding. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=312.06s)]
*  There's... This is a massive... [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=315.06s)]
*  To the right there, this is a huge... [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=317.54s)]
*  That's ballistic. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=319.1s)]
*  This is a huge ballistic missile attack [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=320.1s)]
*  coming from Iran right now. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=321.58s)]
*  You can see off in the distance there. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=322.86s)]
*  I'm not sure... [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=324.74s)]
*  Trey, can you hear me? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=326.02s)]
*  I want you to make sure that you are in a safe location. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=327.42s)]
*  Pan up to the sky here. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=329.58s)]
*  If you need to step back. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=330.58s)]
*  Confirm you're still with me here, Harris. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=331.62s)]
*  I can hear you. Can you hear me? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=333.41999999999996s)]
*  Yep. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=335.21999999999997s)]
*  You can. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=337.06s)]
*  I need to know that you can hear me. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=338.65999999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=340.7s)]
*  Okay, I got you. I got you back. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=341.7s)]
*  I need to know that you are in a safe location [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=342.97999999999996s)]
*  and that you can move away when necessary. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=346.02s)]
*  And now we see several objects [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0DhFXW9Gfg&t=348.78s)]
