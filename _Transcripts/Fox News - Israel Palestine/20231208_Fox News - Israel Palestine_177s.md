# Israel would consider another fighting pause if more hostages are returned: Danny Danon
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg)
*  Let's bring in Danny Dannen on this breaking news. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=0.0s)]
*  Senior member of the Likud party in Israel's parliament [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=2.3000000000000003s)]
*  and a former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=5.24s)]
*  Tell me what you think about the United States. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  Danny, welcome. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=10.98s)]
*  First of all, thank you for being here. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=11.82s)]
*  And tell me what you think about the fact [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=13.14s)]
*  that the United States is the only country at the UN [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=14.52s)]
*  who did not support this resolution [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=18.3s)]
*  for an Israeli ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=21.6s)]
*  So, Martha, first we are grateful for the US [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=26.18s)]
*  for showing again moral clarity. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=28.36s)]
*  But the UN secretary general should be ashamed today. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=30.84s)]
*  Look what he did, he invoked Article 99. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=34.96s)]
*  He didn't do it after the atrocities in Syria [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=37.6s)]
*  where half a million people were killed [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  or two years after the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=42.4s)]
*  All of a sudden he's coming and telling us to cease fire. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=44.72s)]
*  Why he's not asking about our hostages? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=48.28s)]
*  What do you really expect us to do? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=50.8s)]
*  To stop our fight against evil [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=52.4s)]
*  and wait for the terrorists to release the hostages? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  It will never happen. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  You know, we're putting a lot of pressure on Hamas now. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=59.96s)]
*  Our forces are moving forward. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=62.0s)]
*  And I think what we saw today [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=64.28s)]
*  is the secretary general of the UN collaborating with Hamas. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  They're under pressure. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=69.76s)]
*  They're hearing our tanks getting closer to the hostages [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  and they're appealing to the secretary general [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=74.48s)]
*  to put pressure on Israel. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=76.88s)]
*  So we thank the US again. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=78.42s)]
*  We will continue with the military activity [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=80.36s)]
*  to make sure that we eradicate Hamas [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=82.98s)]
*  and we bring back home the hostages. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  And I want to remind you, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=87.08s)]
*  we still have 16 women in the end of Hamas [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=88.16s)]
*  and what we hear, the testimonials from the prisoners [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=91.64s)]
*  who came back from the hostages who came back. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=94.75999999999999s)]
*  Horrible stories what they are doing [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=96.96s)]
*  to the hostages over there. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=98.8s)]
*  No, horrific. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=100.36s)]
*  And but some of those families are saying [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=101.56s)]
*  that they wanna cease fire as well, Dani. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  They want the priority to be getting the hostages home. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=106.2s)]
*  And I know that's putting political pressure [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=109.64s)]
*  on the prime minister and his leadership in Israel. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=111.6s)]
*  What do you say to that? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=115.8s)]
*  So we agreed to a cease fire. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=118.44s)]
*  Hamas broke the cease fire. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=120.32s)]
*  And we are willing to consider another pause [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=122.34s)]
*  if we will see more hostages coming back. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=124.92s)]
*  But we realize that the more pressure we put on Hamas, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=127.62s)]
*  the better the chances for the hostages to come back. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=130.8s)]
*  And that's exactly what we are doing now. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  We're putting a lot of pressure. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  We are paying a heavy price in terms of casualties [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=136.68s)]
*  to our troops, but we are determined. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=139.84s)]
*  We are determined to win this war, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=142.2s)]
*  to bring back the hostages. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=144.36s)]
*  And with all due respect to the UN, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=146.08s)]
*  I ask myself where they have been on October 7th [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  for 60 days they're holding the hostages in captivity. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  I haven't seen any resolution coming [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=154.52s)]
*  from the security council. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=156.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=157.44000000000003s)]
*  All right, Dan and Dan, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=158.26000000000002s)]
*  and thank you for jumping on with us [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIhY3OL4gg&t=159.10000000000002s)]
