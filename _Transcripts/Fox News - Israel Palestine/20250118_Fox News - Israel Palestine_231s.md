# Gen. Jack Keane: This is the ‘tension point’ of the Israel-Hamas cease-fire deal
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [January 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo)
*  Let's get the read from retired four star general and Fox News senior strategic analyst, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=0.0s)]
*  General Jack Keene. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=4.76s)]
*  General, welcome. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=5.76s)]
*  So the ceasefire is seen as perhaps delicate at best. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=9.96s)]
*  What is your assessment of it, sir? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=14.18s)]
*  Yeah, well, certainly this is a complicated deal and it has a certain fragility to it [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=16.6s)]
*  to be sure. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=22.84s)]
*  The first part is likely the easiest, but it also has challenges associated with it. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=24.3s)]
*  It has three pieces to it. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=29.0s)]
*  One is the people exchange, which we've been talking about here, hostages for detainees [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=31.0s)]
*  and prisoners, 33 hostages, but they'll be dealt out over a period of 42 days, three [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=36.16s)]
*  or four at a time. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=44.24s)]
*  Given that length of time that that's taking, almost six weeks, it's fraught with things [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=46.2s)]
*  that could happen that could stop it. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=51.04s)]
*  So that's challenge one. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  The second is territorial. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=55.44s)]
*  The Israelis have to move from where they are, occupying different parts of the Gaza [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=58.199999999999996s)]
*  Strip just to the buffer zones on the eastern part of Gaza, which borders up against Israel. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=63.44s)]
*  This is inside of Gaza, though, buffer zones that they have since established since the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=69.96s)]
*  war began. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=74.24s)]
*  And then they have about 50 days or so to move out of the southern border with Egypt [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=75.72s)]
*  and Gaza, something they've occupied because they call the Philadelphia Corridor because [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=82.03999999999999s)]
*  they know that's where all the tunnels were and all the smuggling of weapons and munitions [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=86.80000000000001s)]
*  has taken place over time and something they're very concerned about. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=91.16000000000001s)]
*  They do. They have conceded to move out of there and they have that amount of time to do it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  And then the third thing is humanitarian relief, up to 600 humanitarian trucks a day, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=99.84s)]
*  something that people certainly need. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=106.12s)]
*  But again, for our audience to understand, Hamas is going to take a part of that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=107.68s)]
*  They'll take as much fuel as they need. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  They'll take as much food not just for themselves, but to sell it back to the Gazans. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=113.68s)]
*  And this has been going on, you know, for years. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=118.6s)]
*  The second phase is really the challenge. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=121.68s)]
*  And remember, so our audience understands the reason why the hostages were taken and the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=124.72s)]
*  numbers they were taken by Hamas unprecedented before is to come down to this point. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=129.88s)]
*  Hamas wants to survive. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=137.24s)]
*  And they're going to use those remaining hostages, the second tranche, some 60 plus of them, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=139.56s)]
*  some of which are dead, for their survival. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=144.96s)]
*  In other words, they're on the table will be Israel will have to get out of Gaza and end [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  the war or the hostages are not going to be released. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=153.52s)]
*  That is the tension point. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=156.68s)]
*  And it will be there real and live. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=158.96s)]
*  And that makes it brings into question whether that second phase is going to happen or not. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=161.4s)]
*  I mean, I know for a fact that the Israelis want to stay in Gaza for a multi year occupation [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=166.92000000000002s)]
*  to ensure that Hamas not only is destroyed, but does not rise again. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=173.68s)]
*  And the agreement in this deal is to go and move out of Gaza completely and then certainly [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  end the war. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=188.6s)]
*  The negotiations for that might begin on the 16th day. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=190.32s)]
*  So starting on Sunday is day one, 16 days later, the negotiations for phase two, which [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=195.24s)]
*  is the real challenge begins then and we'll see what happens as a result of that. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=201.0s)]
*  Maybe a very bumpy ride ahead. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=206.6s)]
*  General Jack Keene, grateful for your time and your analysis today, sir. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=211.2s)]
*  Fox, you can get it all here on YouTube. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNw52xOnnxo&t=225.16s)]
