# Understanding the impact of Blinken's meeting with Saudi defense minister
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE)
*  Congressman Mike McCaul backed with us, the House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=0.0s)]
*  Chairman, it's always good having you. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=3.94s)]
*  Thank you for taking the time. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=5.4s)]
*  Thanks, Neil. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=6.4s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=7.4s)]
*  This meeting between Anthony Blinken and the Saudi defense minister, there's been some [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=8.4s)]
*  criticism of the Saudis that they haven't been more, not necessarily supportive of Israel. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=12.0s)]
*  We understand where they stand. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=17.88s)]
*  But they haven't, you know, been exactly even condoning Israel or helping Israel in any [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=20.3s)]
*  way, certainly, or that is the perception with their Arab neighbors. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=26.9s)]
*  Are you worried? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=30.5s)]
*  Well, you know, yeah, to some extent. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=31.5s)]
*  But I will say this, just given the history of Israel and Mecca and Saudi Arabia, they've [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=35.1s)]
*  been enemies in the past. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=41.58s)]
*  But lately, with the Abraham Accords, and I hope this visit will expand those, the normalization [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=43.3s)]
*  agreement, they understand the enemy of the enemy is my friend, and that is Iran. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=48.379999999999995s)]
*  So they fear Iran the most. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=53.34s)]
*  They don't like Hamas' tie and allegiance to Iran, nor Hezbollah. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=55.6s)]
*  So I see this as a—and by the way, this meeting was supposed to take place before [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=60.32s)]
*  Hamas even invaded Israel. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=64.84s)]
*  Hamas, you asked me in a previous interview, why now? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=67.08s)]
*  Why did Hamas attack Israel? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=71.52s)]
*  Well, it was the 50th anniversary of the Yom Kippur fight, but also I believe that Hamas [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=72.84s)]
*  saw the normalization taking place between Saudi Arabia and Israel, and they want to [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=80.86s)]
*  do something to stop it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=86.88s)]
*  So I think right now our credibility is on the line. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=88.64s)]
*  If we're not successful in Israel, our credibility in the Arab world will go down the toilet, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=90.88s)]
*  and then Iran and China will come in and fill the vacuum. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=96.98s)]
*  You know, Congressman, you're right to go back 50 years ago, the Yom Kippur war, a very [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=100.46000000000001s)]
*  different environment then, and the Arab world stuck together not only against Israel, but [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=104.66s)]
*  us helping Israel. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=110.10000000000001s)]
*  That led to, you know, the Arab oil embargo and the long gas lines, and we can all remember [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=111.94s)]
*  that, those of a certain age. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=116.06s)]
*  So now the question becomes, it's a very different environment, I get that, but you [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=117.46000000000001s)]
*  don't hear condemnation of Hamas from anyone in the Arab world, and I wonder what that [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=123.22s)]
*  could tell you. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=130.1s)]
*  Well, I think certainly in Jordan, they have a lot of Palestinians in their population. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=131.46s)]
*  Egypt, basically tried to kick them out and threw them in the Gaza Strip, if you look [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=137.5s)]
*  at history there. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=142.3s)]
*  Nobody wants them, and that's part of the problem, is the humanitarian crisis. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=144.38s)]
*  None of these Arab nations want to receive the Palestinians. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=148.98s)]
*  So that takes us to the Ra'afah Gate itself. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=153.1s)]
*  I just heard the first American citizen just got released out of there. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=156.22s)]
*  That's what we want to see, but we also don't want a gate that's going to be open to fund [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=159.9s)]
*  and equip and arm Hamas. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=165.26s)]
*  So I think the screening has to be very carefully done, and I've been given assurance as it [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=167.22s)]
*  is, but we don't want to be funding this war, funding Hamas in this war against Israel. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=173.02s)]
*  Yeah, not all Americans are finding that pathway out so easy. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=178.74s)]
*  We're going to be talking to a young couple dealing with that as we speak, Congressman, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=181.78s)]
*  but to your point, it is supposedly being checked and rechecked. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=185.26s)]
*  But ahead of that, I did want to get your take on aid that might be coming Israel's [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=188.3s)]
*  way. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=192.34s)]
*  What is the reason among those concerned that it's Israel-only aid, that eventually, you [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=193.34s)]
*  said, at the end of the day, we must see the Ukraine threat as linked together with Israel? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=197.5s)]
*  What did you mean by that? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=205.62s)]
*  Well, all these threats are linked together. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=207.1s)]
*  When you look at who our adversaries are and their alliance, quite frankly, between Putin [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=209.88s)]
*  and his invasion of Ukraine and threat to Europe, to Chairman Xi in China and his threat [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=216.46s)]
*  to Taiwan and the Pacific, the greatest we've seen since my dad's war, World War II, and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=222.26000000000002s)]
*  then you look at the Ayatollah and Iran and his threat to Israel, they're all enemies [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=227.1s)]
*  of the United States and the West, and they're all tied together. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=233.22s)]
*  They're all linked together. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=236.58s)]
*  I think this package, we're going to start with Israel, and that's appropriate given [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=238.06s)]
*  the threat to Israel and the urgency, but all these threats are tied together. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=241.82s)]
*  And the last one, Neil, quite frankly, is the last line of defense, and that's our [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=246.94s)]
*  southwest border. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=251.94s)]
*  So we have to tackle all these issues, I think, to really deal with the threats that we face [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=253.42000000000002s)]
*  as a nation. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=258.18s)]
*  You know, Chairman, and I'll be dealing with this with other guests throughout this show, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=259.34000000000003s)]
*  as I have earlier on Fox Business, this notion that Iran's provocative attacks, even through [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=262.82s)]
*  emissaries or, you know, rogue groups, is such 28 attacks in little more than two weeks. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=269.02s)]
*  And our response has been to go after those entities that are acting on Iran's behalf, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=278.7s)]
*  but not on Iran itself. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=286.34s)]
*  Do you think that's a mistake? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=289.1s)]
*  Should we target Iran if we have unequivocal proof Iran is behind these attacks on U.S. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=291.02s)]
*  Well, I don't want to—I don't think we want to see escalation, and that would require [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=298.09999999999997s)]
*  an authorization of use of military force that would come out of my committee, the House [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=303.18s)]
*  Foreign Affairs Committee. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=307.26s)]
*  We don't want to see escalation with Hezbollah or Iran, and that's why the deterrence is [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=309.06s)]
*  so important. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=315.09999999999997s)]
*  These carrier strike groups now in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf provide [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=316.78s)]
*  that deterrence against Hezbollah and Iran, but I think the administration is a little [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=321.35999999999996s)]
*  slow in responding to the attacks on our soldiers in Iraq and Syria on what they're finally [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=325.58s)]
*  responding. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=331.14s)]
*  Chairman, if you could just—sir, if you could just hang on to that point of view. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=331.42s)]
*  The president is speaking right now in, I believe, Northfield, Minnesota. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=333.06s)]
*  I believe he's addressing the Israeli situation. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=337.5s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=339.46s)]
*  I want to thank our partners in the region, and particularly Qatar, who've worked so [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=339.9s)]
*  closely with us to support negotiations. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=346.74s)]
*  We've worked so closely with us to facilitate the departure of these citizens. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=351.74s)]
*  At the same time, we're continuing working to significantly step up the flow of critical [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=360.1s)]
*  humanitarian assistance into Gaza. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=365.5s)]
*  The number of trucks entering Gaza continues to increase significantly, but we still have [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=368.54s)]
*  a long way to go. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=373.46000000000004s)]
*  The United States is going to continue to drive humanitarian support for innocent people [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=374.78000000000003s)]
*  in Gaza who need help and they do need help. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=379.72s)]
*  We're going to continue to affirm that Israel has the right to respond to responsibility [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=383.16s)]
*  to defend its citizens from terror, and it needs to do so in a manner that was consistent [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=387.16s)]
*  with international humanitarian law that prioritizes the protection of citizens. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=391.88s)]
*  We've all seen the devastating images from Gaza. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=397.6s)]
*  Palestinian children crying out for lost parents. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=401.72s)]
*  Parents reasoning and writing their children's names on their hands and legs to be identified [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=405.08s)]
*  if the worst happens. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=412.08s)]
*  It's okay. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=413.64s)]
*  Kids are allowed to do that with me. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=414.8s)]
*  Don't worry about it, all right? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=418.24s)]
*  I don't blame her. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=420.88s)]
*  Is it him or her? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=421.88s)]
*  I don't blame her. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=424.56s)]
*  Look, the loss of every innocent life is a tragedy. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=426.88s)]
*  We grieve for those deaths and continue to grieve for the Israeli children and mothers [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=433.32s)]
*  who were brutally slaughtered by Hamas terrorists and also continue to hold in our hearts the [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=437.4s)]
*  hundreds of families and loved ones, including small children and elderly grandparents, including [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=443.12s)]
*  American citizens being held hostage. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=448.2s)]
*  My administration continues to work around the clock to reunite those families. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=451.15999999999997s)]
*  We're not going to give up, period. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=455.88s)]
*  We're not going to give up. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=457.88s)]
*  And I am optimistic, but then I am an optimist. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=463.32s)]
*  Folks, now I want to thank Brad for that introduction. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=471.08s)]
*  Brad said he wasn't sure what a good speaker was. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=476.2s)]
*  He can speak a hell of a lot better than I can farm. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=478.24s)]
*  The president right now is talking about this opening of the Ra'affa crossing today from [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=480.56s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=486.32s)]
*  It is an entry point and an exit point that Egypt orchestrated here to allow those who [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=487.32s)]
*  want to get out to get out. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=491.48s)]
*  Not everybody, though. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=492.92s)]
*  There's a limit to how many can come out rejoined again by Chairman McCaul who was patient enough [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=493.92s)]
*  to go through that. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=498.8s)]
*  You know, Chairman, the president makes clear that this is a good first step. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=500.36s)]
*  Of course, Egypt is providing that opportunity. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=503.52000000000004s)]
*  Separately, France and the Netherlands are drawing up plans to get aid, presumably through [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=506.12s)]
*  that same entry point in the Gaza. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=510.20000000000005s)]
*  But what do you make of how it's going thus far? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=512.88s)]
*  Because part of checking who gets out is making sure that Hamas fighters are not among them. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=515.64s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's absolutely correct. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=522.64s)]
*  And I know this has been a great diplomatic effort with Qatar, UAE, Saudis, Egypt. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=524.68s)]
*  I can tell you the last thing Egypt wants to do is let a radicalized Palestinian Hamas [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=530.24s)]
*  come into their country. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=536.24s)]
*  If you go back in time, it was that very faction, the Muslim Brotherhood, that lit up al-Qaeda [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=538.1s)]
*  in their prisons with Zawahiri. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=543.68s)]
*  So it's in their best interest not to allow that to occur. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=546.0s)]
*  I know they're vetting. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=549.48s)]
*  People coming out of there. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=551.5s)]
*  And I think also if you look at the battle plan that's taking place in Gaza, if you look [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=552.78s)]
*  at the middle of Gaza, you see the Israeli IDF, the military, going across to basically [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=557.58s)]
*  construct a blockade, if you will, that will then open up a humanitarian zone, cutting [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=563.82s)]
*  Hamas out of South Gaza and trapping them in north of Gaza, where they intend to deal [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=569.32s)]
*  with that threat and try to rescue hostages. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=575.98s)]
*  So Chairman, and you had touched on, you were rudely interrupted there, but this notion [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=579.14s)]
*  of responding to Iran by attacking Iran or points in Iran and not some desert hut or [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=583.36s)]
*  something in the middle of nowhere because you think you're taking out those who are [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=590.06s)]
*  acting on Iran's behalf. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=594.58s)]
*  What do you think of that? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=596.1s)]
*  Well, they have proxies, right? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=597.74s)]
*  And they operate through their proxies. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=599.5s)]
*  They don't, typically they don't engage in this on their own. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=601.26s)]
*  does for sure. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=606.3s)]
*  But they really rely on their proxies, which are like the tentacles of Iran, that being [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=607.3s)]
*  Hamas, Hezbollah, the militia groups in Iraq and Syria, the Houthi rebels and that sort [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=611.5s)]
*  of thing. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=618.4599999999999s)]
*  We've been looking at updating our AMF from 2001. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=620.18s)]
*  We need to look at the terror proxies coming from Iran. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=623.26s)]
*  But I think to step it up to bomb Iran right now would really be a big escalation that [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=627.06s)]
*  I'm not sure it would, I think, intensify things, not cool things down. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=633.02s)]
*  You would touch on as well about your hope that they could get a security package that [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=638.5s)]
*  looks after the needs of Israel and Ukraine. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=642.46s)]
*  But your new speaker, Mike Johnson, is not a fan of that, wants to limit it to Israel [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=645.24s)]
*  for the time being. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=649.42s)]
*  You seem optimistic down the road that both countries' needs will be addressed. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=650.72s)]
*  You want them addressed now. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=654.6999999999999s)]
*  He seems to be saying Israel first down the road, Ukraine. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=656.14s)]
*  That looks like an impasse. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=659.62s)]
*  Well, you know, the talk of the day right now is Israel. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=662.02s)]
*  And I think it's important we show our support for Israel. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=666.06s)]
*  But what we do want to see is we can't abandon our allies in Europe. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=669.66s)]
*  We can't withdraw out of Ukraine like we did in Afghanistan. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=675.26s)]
*  Look what happened there. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=678.4399999999999s)]
*  And Putin said in one week he'd take over Ukraine. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=679.9399999999999s)]
*  Then what kind of world are we looking at where adversaries are emboldened like Putin, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=682.5799999999999s)]
*  Chairman Xi and the Ayatollah? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=687.02s)]
*  I think the speaker has this about right. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=688.78s)]
*  What he's looking at is a very strong border security package attached to the Ukraine aid package. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=691.1800000000001s)]
*  That's something back home, that's all my constituents talk about. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=697.0600000000001s)]
*  And if we can't deal with the political asylum issue, which is the real magnet here, then [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=700.42s)]
*  we're really failing to address the problem. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=705.54s)]
*  What's to stop some in Israel from thinking then, sir? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=708.94s)]
*  Again, with the best of intentions. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=711.42s)]
*  I see where you're coming from, maybe where the speaker's coming from, that, you know, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=712.82s)]
*  what President Zelensky could warn Israel. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=716.46s)]
*  We were front and center, too, with America. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=718.42s)]
*  You better be careful because Americans might lose patience and get the wear and tear of [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=721.9s)]
*  a war with you, too. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=728.74s)]
*  Well, I've been critical of the way the administration has conducted the war and managed it. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=730.58s)]
*  They've been very slow to get the weapons in. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=735.34s)]
*  We do need more accountability, oversight. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=737.98s)]
*  We need a path for victory. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=740.1s)]
*  That's all my members really want to hear is what is your plan for victory? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=741.9399999999999s)]
*  I think you'll find a majority of them would support our allies in the region. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=745.38s)]
*  This is a global interlinked threat against the United States and the West. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=750.6999999999999s)]
*  So I think the speaker has come out messaging wise saying he does support the effort in [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=754.18s)]
*  Ukraine, but we're going to have to get something in return for that. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=760.6999999999999s)]
*  I think this is our best opportunity to get something on the border that could be a real [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=764.5s)]
*  game changer as opposed to seven million people that have come in to this country and then [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=770.7s)]
*  given notices to appear and released into our society. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=776.82s)]
*  It just seems to me less less attention to Ukraine, regardless more attention to the [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=780.1s)]
*  border to your point, more attention to Israel for the moment, less so to Ukraine for the [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=785.02s)]
*  moment. Am I right to interpret it that way? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=788.98s)]
*  But that will that will occur soon. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=791.0600000000001s)]
*  You're going to see an aid package come out of the Senate that will have all four threats [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=793.18s)]
*  attached and linked together. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=797.3s)]
*  So I don't want our friends in Ukraine to think we're abandoning them. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=799.38s)]
*  We are supporting Israel this week. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=803.3s)]
*  I think next week you're going to be looking at a Ukraine border bill, but also an Indo-Pacom [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=805.58s)]
*  bill Indo-Pacific bill to protect Taiwan and our friends in the Asian Pacific from the [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=811.22s)]
*  threats coming out of communist China. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=820.22s)]
*  All right, Chairman, it's good catching up with you. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=822.78s)]
*  Thank you for taking the time. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TMnJuPDlE&t=824.98s)]
