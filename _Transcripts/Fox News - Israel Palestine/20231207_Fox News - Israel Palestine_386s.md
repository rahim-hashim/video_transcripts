# Former Miss Israel: What happened to humanity?
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ)
*  So from the UN, we have followed this news all week, and now this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Silence is despicable. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=3.84s)]
*  The women who were raped and murdered on October 7th [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=7.68s)]
*  will maybe silent forever, but justice will be done. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Truth shall prevail. We will never forget them. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  A stirring speech by Israel's former Miss World at the United Nations, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  the Jewish state pressing the UN to investigate the horrific sexual violence committed by Hamas [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=23.44s)]
*  terrorists on October 7th, including rape and mutilation. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=28.32s)]
*  Lenore Abarguil is also a victim of sexual assault, and she joins us now. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=31.92s)]
*  And that story of what you went through came out just before, right around when you won Miss World. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=37.84s)]
*  So your story was out there for everybody to know, and you've been quite an amazing advocate. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=43.36s)]
*  What was it like at the United Nations giving that speech? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  Wow, didn't expect that at all to be so emotional, strong. I didn't expect that [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=53.36s)]
*  people will respond to what happened to my story and to what happened to the Israeli women. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=60.8s)]
*  I mean, I think something changed since my speech, a little bit. We still have a long way. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=68.72s)]
*  The thing is, you know, for me, 25 years ago, when I promote my film, Brave Miss World, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=77.52s)]
*  it was on Netflix for like 10 years. It was Emmy nomination. It has, you know, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=84.32s)]
*  people watching it from all over the world, and I felt the UN were supporting me, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=91.28s)]
*  believed me, didn't ask for any investigation then. But today I feel so ashamed that I was a part of [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=95.76s)]
*  this organization and any other women organization that are so silent and didn't condemn Hamas even [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=106.0s)]
*  once, except one time on Friday evening when they say in the same sentence that they alarmed by what [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=113.76s)]
*  happened to the Israeli woman by the sexual assault. And then in the same sentence, they say [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=122.4s)]
*  that they are very worried about Palestinian women and that we have to have a ceasefire. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=128.8s)]
*  The ambassador from the Czech Republic a month ago at the UN said, why is my country even an [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=132.56s)]
*  organization here? Why are we even involved in the UN? And when you go to the UN, you know what [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=136.8s)]
*  you're up against. I mean, you're pushing a big rock up a hill and you're even making progress. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=141.84s)]
*  Couple things now. We've had significant women's groups in America that have said nothing about [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=148.08s)]
*  rape. We can put it on screen and show everybody, World Health Organization, that we're not going to [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=153.04s)]
*  have to do anything about it. I stand with her and on and on the list goes. I want you to listen [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=157.92s)]
*  to your Israeli prime minister. This is Benjamin Netanyahu from yesterday on this very topic. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=169.92s)]
*  I say to the women's rights organizations, to the human rights organizations, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  you've heard of the rape of Israeli women, horrible atrocities, sexual mutilation, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=180.64s)]
*  where the hell are you? Can you answer that? Yeah, you know, it's me too, unless you are a Jew. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=188.88s)]
*  That's it. It's hard for me to say that, but this is the truth. You know what women organization did [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=197.6s)]
*  is they took it to the political side. It's not about political. It's not about free Palestine. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=205.6s)]
*  It's not about which size you are on the map. To use rape as an act of war [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  is unbearable. I mean, what happened to humanity? You know, there is one of my friends. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=224.56s)]
*  Sorry, it's very hard for me to speak about it. It's okay. Take your time. Before I arrived here, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=232.88s)]
*  he told me a story about this young woman that he saw a video of her that she was raped by 10 Hamas [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  people, one after another, raped her, a young woman. Screaming, they beat her. They spitted on her. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=250.24s)]
*  They then butchered her. And then one of them took her cell phone and just sent everything to her [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=264.88s)]
*  mother. Her screaming just haunts my friend every night he tried to sleep. And her screaming [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=270.72s)]
*  should be out there for all the world to shout out for this girl that is not here to shout for herself. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=281.92s)]
*  But instead, all the women are in the organization. It's just silent. I mean, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=288.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm telling you, I'm speechless. I have nothing. There's no humanity in what you're describing to [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=294.4s)]
*  us. It's just it's absent. Menor, for those hostages who have been released, and we know [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=300.47999999999996s)]
*  that there were sexual assaults perpetrated against them during their captivity. From your [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=306.55999999999995s)]
*  experience, what kind of help and support will they need and can we help provide to them? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=311.59999999999997s)]
*  I think the first help you can do is first to believe. Because when you when somebody [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=316.96s)]
*  goes through something so bad, you have to first believe and support him. And that's the basic. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=322.4s)]
*  You cannot go, you know, do anything if you don't have that. What just kills my heart now is just [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=328.96s)]
*  the fact that there are so many hostages that are still there. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=339.12s)]
*  It's just the fact that there are so many hostages that are still there [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=342.32s)]
*  going through I don't know what. And the world is silent. But in Boko Haram they spoke, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=348.32s)]
*  in Ukraine they spoke, and now it's just like. You're very brave. And you are not silent. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=356.32s)]
*  I'm not. And we're glad to have you. Thank you so much. And have a safe trip. Sorry, I'm not shaking. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=363.12s)]
*  Thank you. Stay strong. Stay strong and healthy. Thank you so much for everything you do. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=367.84s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you for being here. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxc_CSly7WQ&t=373.67999999999995s)]
