# Former Israel PM provides crucial update on Hamas releasing the third set of hostages
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo)
*  Joining me now is the former prime minister of Israel, Naftali Bennett. Welcome, sir. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=0.0s)]
*  Hi there, Mike. So you heard the reporting that President Biden would like to extend the ceasefire [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=5.76s)]
*  to get more hostages out. Your reaction to that, sir? Well, we have two goals. The first goal is to [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=11.76s)]
*  eradicate and eliminate Hamas. We have to wipe Hamas off the face of earth after what they did [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=20.48s)]
*  and what they say they're going to do again and again, which is try and massacre, rape, murder [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=28.32s)]
*  Israeli children, parents, moms, dads. We cannot continue with this entity existing. And the second [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=34.88s)]
*  objective is to release the hostages. To some extent, there's tension between these two objectives. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=44.8s)]
*  Right now, we're in this deal which provides roughly 10 to 12 hostages per day of pause. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  But there is a price for the day of pause because it prolongs the existence of Hamas. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=58.96s)]
*  Once this interim deal is over, the IDF will go full force to eradicate Hamas. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=65.92s)]
*  I realize you're not the current prime minister. You're a former prime minister. So your analysis [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=73.44s)]
*  is significant, but you're not the guy making the decision right now. Your thoughts on an [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=78.0s)]
*  extension, what would it take for there to be an extension of the ceasefire? Right now, there's a [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=82.96s)]
*  specific arrangement where if we get 10 to 12, I believe 12 hostages per day, we're willing to [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=90.0s)]
*  do that. That's the price tag, but up to 10 days after which we continue fighting. And we're not [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=98.48s)]
*  fighting because we want to fight. We're fighting because we have no choice. No country could allow [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=105.68s)]
*  a Hamas Nazi state on its border. Do you worry this pause in fighting is hurting Israel's momentum? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  First of all, of course it is to some extent. I don't want to be blind to reality even when [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=122.08000000000001s)]
*  it's unpleasant. Obviously, in battle, you want to hit your opponent and when your enemy is down, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=127.44000000000001s)]
*  that's when you want to, I would say, squeeze it in order to bring victory. So it is a pause, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=134.48s)]
*  but I can tell you I'm meeting soldiers. I'm meeting commanders. I'm meeting the people of [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=141.28s)]
*  Israel. Everyone here is so still resolved to defeat Hamas. So that's what we're going to do. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=147.2s)]
*  How do you feel like the ground campaign, the military campaign, has been going prior to this pause? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=154.79999999999998s)]
*  It went very well. And the result of a very successful ground campaign, where we just barged [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=160.48s)]
*  into Gaza against Hamas and the terrorists with massive force, and it brought Hamas to ask for [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=167.68s)]
*  this deal. So obviously the performance of IDF is very good and very effective, but we're going to [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=177.6s)]
*  have to reignite the whole machine in order to defeat Hamas on the southern side. We've [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=185.44s)]
*  conquered and taken over the northern side of Gaza. Now we need to take care of the south. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=193.84s)]
*  My sense is a lot of American elected officials are very supportive of Israel in this conflict. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=198.64s)]
*  There has been some criticism today coming from Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy. I want to play [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=204.16s)]
*  that and get you to react to it. Benjamin Netanyahu believed that you could ignore [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=209.76s)]
*  the Palestinians, that you could try to squash their desires for a state, and ultimately that [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=217.92s)]
*  would bring peace to the region and to Israel. That's just not the case. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=224.48s)]
*  We've heard President Biden talk about a two-state solution. He's saying that the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=228.48s)]
*  prime minister ignored the Palestinian desire to have its own state. Your thoughts, sir? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=232.39999999999998s)]
*  Listen, in Gaza they got a state. We gave them a full-blown state in 2005. We pulled out of Gaza [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=240.32s)]
*  to the very 1949 line, handed them over the entire land to the PA, and they had the opportunity to [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=248.23999999999998s)]
*  choose to build and turn it into Singapore in the Middle East with the beautiful beaches, great [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=255.44s)]
*  weather, and instead they took all the billions of dollars they got and they turned it into [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=260.88s)]
*  Khamisistan, into a terror state. Unfortunately, I'll also say something that's unpleasant, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=266.56s)]
*  but it's true. Khamis enjoys massive support of the public in Gaza. Unfortunately, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=272.08s)]
*  thousands of civilians participated, or over a thousand civilians participated in the massacres [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=281.68s)]
*  of October 7th, and hundreds of thousands of them supported it remotely. So we've got a problem. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=289.04s)]
*  The last thing we're going to do now is rebuild another Palestinian terror state that will attack [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=299.36s)]
*  us, massacre us, shoot rockets at us. We are showing our viewers right now a rival of Red Cross [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=306.32000000000005s)]
*  vehicles carrying the prisoners who have just been released. Obviously concerns for their health. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=313.20000000000005s)]
*  We've heard some preliminary reports suggesting malnutrition, a big issue, but the great news is [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=318.4s)]
*  those folks are free. Naphtali Bennett, grateful for your time, sir. Thank you so much. Have a [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd3gNDLpsKo&t=323.84s)]
