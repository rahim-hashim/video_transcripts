# Mark Levin: This is not free speech
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY)
*  Welcome back, America. I want to welcome a good friend of mine, a principled and courageous man, Alan Dershowitz. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=0.0s)]
*  He's written a fantastic new book, War Against the Jews, How to End Hamas Barbarism. He actually wrote it in about a month. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=9.0s)]
*  But I want to get right to the nub of the matter. You spent your life in academia. You spent your life at Harvard, Harvard Law School. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=16.0s)]
*  You see what's going on in these schools. And it's not just Harvard, University of Pennsylvania, Columbia. There's 200 of them. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=25.0s)]
*  They have these students for justice in Palestine. They have these Hamas networked individuals in these various educational centers. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=32.0s)]
*  They have administrators who are cowards. Looking back and now looking today, what do you make of all this? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=40.0s)]
*  Well, I looked into the eyes of evil. I taught 10,000 students and some of these students have now become Hitler's youth. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=48.0s)]
*  And if terrorism comes to the United States, and it will because Hamas is contagious, and when people start blowing up schools the way, for example, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=57.0s)]
*  radicals did in the 1970s or army bases, some of my former students from Harvard will become those terrorists. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=66.0s)]
*  There is a fifth column in this country of young radical students who will turn against America and become the future of terrorism against us. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=76.0s)]
*  So this is coming to a theater near you if it's not stopped in Israel, in Gaza and on American university campuses. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=86.0s)]
*  Thankfully, a lawsuit, an 82 page lawsuit was filed against New York University by a prominent law firm alleging violation of the Civil Rights Act, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=94.0s)]
*  violation of the Business Act, breach of contract by these schools encouraging anti-Semitism, anti-Israel attitudes, prejudice against Jews in class, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=104.0s)]
*  and despicable actions by faculty members. A hundred Harvard faculty members signed a letter essentially supporting Hamas. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=116.0s)]
*  Let me ask you this, Alan. We have a very big bureaucracy. We have a huge Department of Justice Civil Rights Division. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=126.0s)]
*  We have a huge Civil Rights Division and another big bureaucracy called the Department of Education. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=133.0s)]
*  Donald Trump signed an executive order which gives those authorities the power to act against anti-Semitism and threats on college campuses. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=138.0s)]
*  Maybe they're doing it here and there. I'm not seeing a big push. I'm not hearing from the attorney general. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=147.0s)]
*  I'm not hearing from the head of either Civil Rights Division. What the hell's going on? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=152.0s)]
*  I was at the White House when President Trump announced that. He called on me to speak and I congratulated him, even though I'm not a Republican. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=156.0s)]
*  I congratulated him for his great efforts in getting the administration behind this effort to root out anti-Semitism. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=164.0s)]
*  It hasn't worked. In fact, what's happened, and it's this administration and Biden as well, whenever they talk about anti-Semitism, they say, and Islamophobia. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=171.0s)]
*  I got news for you. There is no Islamophobia at any university in the United States. It's a fake. It's virtue parading. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=181.0s)]
*  Oh, we have to fight anti-Semitism and anti-Islamophobia. Let me tell you who the anti-Semites are. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=188.0s)]
*  They are largely, not completely, the radical Muslims who claim to be victims of Islamophobia. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=194.0s)]
*  This is a one-sided issue. Only Jews and pro-Israel Christians on campus today are being attacked. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=202.0s)]
*  Muslims are not being attacked. Arabs, they're the privileged groups. They're the ones who get the benefits. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=210.0s)]
*  They're the ones who get the advantages from teachers. They're the ones who get the good recommendations. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=217.0s)]
*  But if you say you're pro-Israel, if you were a kippah or a star of David, you are not getting fair treatment at American universities today. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=222.0s)]
*  And there has to be a response from the government or else we're going to bring lawsuits. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=230.0s)]
*  You know, her to Jew, we sue you. That's going to be our new motto. And we're not going to allow this kind of pushing around. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=235.0s)]
*  As we've heard before, this happened in the 1930s. Harvard welcomed Nazis. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=242.0s)]
*  Yale had a pledge that said we won't fight against the Nazis. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=247.0s)]
*  People marched through the streets of New York doing Heil Hitler's and swastikas. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=252.0s)]
*  We will not let that happen again. As long as I have one ounce of energy, I am going to fight this. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=257.0s)]
*  I'm going to fight it at universities. I'm going to fight it at places where I went to school. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=263.0s)]
*  And I am not going to rest until we see not only Hamas rooted out, but Hamas supporters. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=267.0s)]
*  The National Lawyers Guild, which has thousands of lawyers at every university, law school in the United States, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=273.0s)]
*  has become the primary legal source against Israel. On October 8th, before the blood was even dry, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=280.0s)]
*  they praised Hamas for a wonderful military action. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=287.0s)]
*  They talked about Israel having to free murderers, but they never said one word in support of the hostages. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=292.0s)]
*  The National Lawyers Guild, if you have a lawyer from the National Lawyers Guild, ask that lawyer, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=297.0s)]
*  do you personally defend beheadings, burnings, rapes and kidnappings? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=304.0s)]
*  And if you do, treat him the way you would treat a lawyer who belonged to the Ku Klux Klan and supported the lynching of blacks. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=310.0s)]
*  There is no difference. 1200 Jews were lynched on October 7th, and these people support those lynchings. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=316.0s)]
*  To underscore your point and the Prime Minister's point before you, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=324.0s)]
*  the Third Reich in the Ivory Tower, Complicity and Conflict on American Campuses, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=329.0s)]
*  Professor Stephen Norwood, it is a fantastic, now he's a liberal, but this is in my view, but it's a fantastic book. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=334.0s)]
*  And he explains, as you're explaining, in the 30s and even in the 40s, the Germans infiltrated our colleges and universities. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=342.0s)]
*  They infiltrated our culture. It was intentional. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=349.0s)]
*  And there was this fifth column, as you say, of pro-Nazi students, pro-Nazi professors, pro-Nazi media in this country. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=352.0s)]
*  And your point is, and it's here again, but this time it's funded by groups like the Hamas Network. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=361.0s)]
*  We know of now some billionaires and millionaires. There's more information coming out who are backing these movements and so forth. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=368.0s)]
*  And when colleges and universities pretend that this is free speech and academic freedom, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=374.0s)]
*  they're giving cover to violence, to anti-Semitism, which is not free speech. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv2wT3wPAY&t=380.0s)]
