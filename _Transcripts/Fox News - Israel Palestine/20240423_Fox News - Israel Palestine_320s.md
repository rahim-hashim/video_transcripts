# Columbia University teaches rocket science but can't define hate speech: student
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8)
*  Okay, thank you very much Alexis. With that we bring in Daniella Simons, a Jewish student [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=0.0s)]
*  who goes to Columbia. She's a first-year student. Ricky Schlott joins us as well, New York post-columnist [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=6.36s)]
*  and part-time Columbia student who left NYU. So Daniella, you know, what goes through your [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=11.52s)]
*  mind when you look at the fact that you couldn't go to campus today? And don't you, isn't there [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=16.84s)]
*  an expectation that the university should be able to provide an environment where no [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=23.0s)]
*  matter what, you can go get the education that you paid for? That is the expectation. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=26.78s)]
*  And it's shocking what's going on. It's shocking that instead of studying philosophy and political [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=32.94s)]
*  science, I'm here with you today. Yeah. It is, you know, I mean, it is, the difference [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=39.7s)]
*  between protesting, which as Americans, we all understand people have a right to protest [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=48.46s)]
*  on campus. But then you hear, Daniella, these students yelling, go back to Poland. And [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=54.26s)]
*  I think about the things that have been called hate speech over the past several years. If [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=59.58s)]
*  this doesn't qualify, I'm not sure what does. This is hate speech. This is the definition [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=63.82s)]
*  of hate speech. And it's crazy to me to think that I study at an institution that literally [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=69.0s)]
*  produces rocket scientists, yet they can't say that this is hate speech. Do you have [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=75.06s)]
*  Is there security on campus? And why can't they provide safe pathways for everyone to [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=81.26s)]
*  go to class? I think there's not enough of them. And even though they have been increased, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=86.14s)]
*  there's mobs. I mean, we're seeing the footage. It's mayhem. It is unbelievable. Here's AOC [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=93.18s)]
*  speaking at President Biden's Earth Day event just a short time ago. Watch this and Ricky, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=99.98s)]
*  I'll get your thoughts on the other side. Today also serves as a reminder of the power [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=103.66000000000001s)]
*  of organizing, of what we can accomplish when young people, climate advocates, labor [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=109.66s)]
*  organizers, and working people of all backgrounds come together to demand the future we all [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=116.25999999999999s)]
*  deserve. She also said it's especially important when we remember the power of young people [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=123.38s)]
*  shaping the country today and the leadership of the peaceful student protests on campuses [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=129.82s)]
*  like Columbia, Yale and Berkeley and many others. Ricky, what do you say to that? And [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=134.22s)]
*  you've only been going to a class on Wednesday nights up there, but you're amazed by what [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=138.73999999999998s)]
*  you've seen. I was shocked that when I signed up for one class this semester, I've had to [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=142.78s)]
*  go through an NYPD checkpoint almost every single time just to get access to campus and [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=147.45999999999998s)]
*  show my ID. But you know, I'm with AOC if it was just peaceful protesting and just people [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=152.01999999999998s)]
*  using their free speech rights, even if I disagree with it. But this isn't a legal encampment. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=157.54s)]
*  They're trespassing in these tents on a private university campus in the middle of the quad [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=162.17999999999998s)]
*  saying and screaming incendiary things to the point that students, Jewish students that [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=167.94s)]
*  I speak to on campus say that they certainly don't feel safe, that they feel that their [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=172.1s)]
*  presence just mere presence is a protest in and of itself. But on Thursday, I gave the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=175.94s)]
*  university credit for sweeping these kids out, but they just set up shop directly across [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=180.57999999999998s)]
*  the way of the pathway in the quad from where they were on Thursday and they're back. There's [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=185.72s)]
*  more of them. They're bolder. They're screaming. They're getting in people's faces. And they're [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=190.38s)]
*  also stoking protests outside campus gates, which is where we hear really disgusting things [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=194.94s)]
*  like protesters saying we are Hamas. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=199.9s)]
*  Yeah. Daniela, was there an effort after October 7th for these sides to speak to each other? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=201.82s)]
*  Yes. And how did that go? How did we get from that to this? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=208.82s)]
*  After October 7th happened, I went around to pretty much every single person I saw wearing [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=215.7s)]
*  a kaffir on campus and I asked to have a conversation. I invited them to come get coffee with me. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=221.70000000000002s)]
*  And most of them said, I'm sorry, I'm not the right person for that. I don't know enough [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=226.98000000000002s)]
*  about the conflict. I don't actually, I'm just here in solidarity with my Palestinian [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=232.26s)]
*  brothers and sisters, they would say to me, or they would just refer me to Al Jazeera [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=236.9s)]
*  if I wanted more information. I remember one notable time there were a couple of students [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=240.9s)]
*  that were selling kaffirs and so I asked them like, hey, what's the symbolism of the kaffir [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=245.18s)]
*  for Palestinian people? And they had nothing to say to me. They handed me a pamphlet. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=250.06s)]
*  It's so sad. And Ricky, you left NYU and you say that this experience at Columbia has validated [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=256.86s)]
*  why you left this kind of education. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=263.18s)]
*  Yeah, I think I sniffed the rot at the foundation on the institutional level a while ago at [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=265.94s)]
*  NYU and I felt that there was a problem with radicalization festering under the surface. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=271.94s)]
*  And I think post October 7th has really been a wake up call for people who haven't been [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=277.1s)]
*  on campus that this is absolutely out of control and that students are such, such extremists [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=280.54s)]
*  at this point. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=286.78000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, we have to go but just put those professors up on the wall on our way out here because [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=287.78000000000003s)]
*  these professors teach in the Middle Eastern Studies Department. So they may be the reason [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=293.06s)]
*  why these students don't know the answers to the questions that you asked them, Danielle, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=298.58000000000004s)]
*  because they haven't been taught both sides of the story in the Middle East. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=302.5s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_b7GNYze8&t=306.26s)]
