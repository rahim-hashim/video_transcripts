# Massive protests erupt in Israel after Hamas hostage executions
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [September 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A)
*  Let's bring in former FBI Special Agent and Navy SEAL Jonathan Gilliam. Jonathan, we reported [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=0.0s)]
*  Biden and Harris meeting in the Situation Room in a matter of hours. How much faith [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=4.96s)]
*  do you have in Biden and Harris to bring the remaining hostages home? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=9.28s)]
*  I don't put faith in Washington, D.C. politics. You know, I put faith in God. And but when it [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  comes to especially Biden and Harris, if we look at what they've displayed historically, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=22.88s)]
*  they're going to push out some sound bites. They're going to make claims to appease [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=29.84s)]
*  their voters, but not to upset Israel too much. And I don't think anything will occur. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=36.56s)]
*  If there's airstrikes or if Iran tries to attack Israel through the air, perhaps the United States [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=43.44s)]
*  will lend a hand there. But I don't think anything's going to come out of this. They [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=50.72s)]
*  don't want to risk it. They've shown that they don't risk force in the wake of a political [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=54.16s)]
*  election or any type of politics. So I don't see much coming out of their meeting except for sound [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=60.64s)]
*  bites. OK, with that in mind, how responsible are Biden and Harris for the situation in Israel [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=66.47999999999999s)]
*  unraveling the way it has? Well, I think when we look at the 50,000 foot view of this entire [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=72.56s)]
*  situation, Todd, what we see, especially when you hear the reports coming from the AP about [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=81.84s)]
*  who's protesting over there, and it's interesting when you read the AP because they've moved further [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=88.16s)]
*  and further left, they make it sound as though it's a nationwide protest or strikes that are [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  going on in Israel. But it's union workers, it's students, it's people who are on one side of a [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=99.44s)]
*  divided political election time in Israel. It's just like in the United States. So I'd have to [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=107.44s)]
*  say what's happening over there is very similar to what's happening here, where politics and emotion [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=115.44s)]
*  have divided the people. And the way that they look at these critical issues is through election [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  and through campaigns and through appeasing these protesters instead of doing what's effective. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=130.72s)]
*  That's very dangerous. It's been very dangerous to them. That's what was happening on October 6th [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=139.6s)]
*  of last year. That's why Israel got attacked. And that's the way the United States is right now. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=144.88s)]
*  So I would say that President Biden and Vice President Harris and the way that they have [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=149.28s)]
*  confronted Iran, the way they've given Iran money and freedom, set up Hamas and set up Hezbollah [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=154.72s)]
*  to make these attacks and to let Hamas carry out the hostage taking of all these individuals [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=161.44s)]
*  and then killing them. And there's no response ever from the United States. Iran never suffers. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=169.2s)]
*  Hamas has only suffered because Israel has turned on them, and the same with Hezbollah. But overall, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=174.8s)]
*  the United States has set back for the past four years and allowed Iran to grow stronger and [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=180.16s)]
*  stronger with no repercussions. There are some that are saying the hostage executions and [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=185.44s)]
*  subsequent protests slash strikes that we just saw on our screen, that they're going to be the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=191.28s)]
*  turning point. But listening to your last couple of answers, it doesn't sound like you agree with [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=196.24s)]
*  that. Your thoughts, Jonathan? Well, Israel's a divided population. There's many people who [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=201.04s)]
*  support the total victory plan of Netanyahu. And then there's a large group that supports a [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=207.28s)]
*  ceasefire in the hopes that they'll get hostages back. But Iran, Hezbollah, Hamas, they've all [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=214.4s)]
*  shown, all their proxies have shown that that never works with them. If you appease them, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=221.28s)]
*  then they will take advantage of it. If you use force, they take a step back. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=226.4s)]
*  So any type of ceasefire with Iran, Hezbollah, and Hamas is only a temporary fix. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=230.88s)]
*  They have to be shown force. But the problem with the total victory plan is that it's a response [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  plan. It came after October 6. And when you have a plan that comes as a result of an attack, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=246.07999999999998s)]
*  that plan is never quite perfect the way it should be, especially in a political season like this. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=255.28s)]
*  And I'll say one other thing, Todd, about this. If President Trump gets elected, and I hope that [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=261.92s)]
*  he does, I've always been a supporter of Trump's, he needs to surround himself with effective [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=266.8s)]
*  experts who understand these problems and do not feel the need to appease. He can manage that [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=273.36s)]
*  appeasement, but he does not need to surround himself with advisors and counselors that appease [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=280.24s)]
*  these protesters and this social media movement that's gone around in support of terrorist groups [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=286.88s)]
*  and has forgotten our allies. President Trump, when he gets elected, and hopefully he does, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=292.96000000000004s)]
*  he will remember that, and he won't pick Washington, D.C. satellites like Bill Barr and [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=299.04s)]
*  these other individuals who've always been around Washington, D.C., or generals and admirals who will [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=305.12s)]
*  turn around and stab him in the back. He needs real experts who worked on the ground, that are [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=309.76s)]
*  operationally sound, and will not tell him what he wants to hear, but tell him what he needs to hear. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=314.24s)]
*  That's what needs to happen in Israel with Netanyahu, and it needs to happen in this country [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=320.88s)]
*  when President Trump is elected. Jonathan T. Gilliam, coming at you strong here on a Labor Day [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=325.28s)]
*  morning. We appreciate it, Jonathan. Thank you. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=330.0s)]
*  Most compelling analysis. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojE8s8LSW-A&t=339.76s)]
