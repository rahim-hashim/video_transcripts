# Two top Hamas officials killed by Israeli forces
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18)
*  IDF forces are now closing in on all of the Gaza territory to try to eliminate Hamas leaders [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=0.0s)]
*  and fighters who are still there. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=6.32s)]
*  Troops breaching Hamas defense lines in Gaza's second-largest city, where they are hunting [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  for a senior leader of the terror group believed to be hiding underground. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=13.72s)]
*  Israel's military says it's killed about half of Hamas' mid-level battalion commanders, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=19.6s)]
*  but the campaign is also taking a toll on Palestinians seeking refuge from the widening [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=24.44s)]
*  offensive. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=28.8s)]
*  Trey Yanks is reporting on the ground there in southern Israel for us at this hour. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=30.0s)]
*  He's got an update, Trey. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=33.4s)]
*  What is the latest in Gaza right now? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=34.92s)]
*  Sandra, good afternoon. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=37.24s)]
*  It's been two months since the October 7 massacre in southern Israel, and the war that followed [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=40.44s)]
*  rages on. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=46.44s)]
*  Israeli forces now operating in the northern and southern parts of the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=48.0s)]
*  Much of the fighting today taking place around the Jabalia neighborhood, also in Gaza's second-largest [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  city of Khan Yunis. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=57.64s)]
*  We also know this afternoon Israeli media reporting that Gaddi Eisenkot, the former [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=59.32s)]
*  chief of staff in Israel and a man that currently sits on the war cabinet for this country, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=64.68s)]
*  lost his son in the battles. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=70.36s)]
*  These are intense battles taking place as Israeli forces go after Hamas leadership. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=72.48s)]
*  And as you've noted, many of those leaders are currently hiding underground. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=77.64s)]
*  The Israelis say they are using their air force to support those infantry troops as [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=81.72s)]
*  they do push forward. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=85.6s)]
*  They also say that they killed two top Hamas officials in the past two days, one of them, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=87.24s)]
*  Abed Rantisi, the head of Hamas' observation unit, partially responsible for planning the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=91.88s)]
*  October 7 massacre that took place exactly two months ago. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=97.28s)]
*  This also comes as we're learning more about the 138 hostages still inside Gaza and the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=101.28s)]
*  group that was released as part of that broader ceasefire deal just last month. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  One of those hostages that was released speaking out at a government meeting. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  I do want you to pull up her words here on the screen. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=115.04s)]
*  She says, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=118.36s)]
*  My daughters are asking, where is daddy? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=119.36s)]
*  And I have to tell them that the bad people don't want to release him yet. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=121.44s)]
*  You are placing politics over the return of the abductees. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=125.32000000000001s)]
*  Currently there is a lot of tension inside Israel and frustration with decisions made [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=129.12s)]
*  by the government and how many hostages they've been able to bring home. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=133.08s)]
*  We spoke with that woman's brother just yesterday and he had this to say about the situation. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=136.46s)]
*  There are people that are dying piece by piece there as we speak. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=142.32s)]
*  And we know that both of my sisters told us that when they were there, they said we were [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=153.84s)]
*  sure that Israel gave up on us. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=161.16s)]
*  Two months into this conflict, we often talk about the airstrikes and the bullets inside [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=173.32s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=178.92s)]
*  But this is a story about the people, so many families across Israel still waiting for answers [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=179.92s)]
*  about their loved ones. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=184.84s)]
*  Sandra. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  Trey Yanks reporting from southern Israel for us at this hour. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=187.07999999999998s)]
*  Trey, thank you. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2zodxyrn18&t=189.56s)]
