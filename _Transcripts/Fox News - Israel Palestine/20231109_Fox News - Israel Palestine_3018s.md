# State Department gives update on US airstrike in Syria
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY)
*  MR RATHKE. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=0.0s)]
*  Good afternoon, everybody. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1.0s)]
*  Apologies for being a little tardy, just dealing with some random things. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2.0s)]
*  I don't have anything off the top, so Simon, do you want to kick us off? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=9.16s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=14.0s)]
*  So we saw the announcement earlier that the Israelis have agreed to these four-hour pauses. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=15.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=20.6s)]
*  Yeah, I'm wondering if there's a few details – more details you can give. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=21.6s)]
*  Previously, the Israelis had said they wouldn't agree to humanitarian pauses without release [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=26.08s)]
*  of hostages, so is there some kind of agreement from the Hamas side that has facilitated this? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=30.24s)]
*  The Israelis can obviously provide you with additional details, but I wanted to note that [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=37.12s)]
*  this new development has been, I think, a direct result of some of the engagement discussions [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  and diplomacy that the President, Secretary Blinken, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=52.0s)]
*  have all been deeply engaged on. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=57.0s)]
*  This has been something that has been important to us as well, is assessing avenues in which [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=60.440000000000005s)]
*  humanitarian pauses could be initiated to permit civilians to depart – specifically [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=69.44s)]
*  depart areas where there are active hostilities, increase the flow of aid, as well as enable [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=77.44000000000001s)]
*  conditions for the release of hostages. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=84.44000000000001s)]
*  This is something that we hope will continue to take place and happen as well, and it's [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=86.24000000000001s)]
*  something we're going to continue to keep an eye out. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=91.84s)]
*  So again, this is not a black-and-white situation. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=94.28s)]
*  It's something that we're going to continue to work on with our partners in Israel about [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=97.84s)]
*  these kinds of efforts. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=103.32000000000001s)]
*  Just to reiterate some of the details that were announced, there will be two humanitarian [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=104.67999999999999s)]
*  corridors, allowing people to flee the areas of hostilities in the northern part of Gaza. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=111.68s)]
*  The first such corridor, open between four and five hours every day for the past few [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=117.52s)]
*  days, has already enabled many thousands of people to reach safer areas. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=122.76s)]
*  The second route along the coastal road will enable many more thousands to reach safer [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=128.48s)]
*  areas in the south. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=132.8s)]
*  And of course, we are continuing to work closely with our Israeli partners to address and remain [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=134.8s)]
*  vigilant about efforts from Hamas to discourage and prevent civilians from fleeing this area. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=142.64s)]
*  And simultaneously, as we talk about this movement of civilians, it's also critical [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=149.28s)]
*  that humanitarian supplies and assistance are expanded in the areas where people are [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=154.48s)]
*  moving in the case specifically of southern Gaza. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=159.88s)]
*  Over the course of yesterday, we saw 106 trucks of humanitarian aid flow into Gaza through [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=165.07999999999998s)]
*  the Rafah crossing. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=173.0s)]
*  Rafah crossing remains open today for the inflow of humanitarian aid as well as the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=174.56s)]
*  safe departure of foreign nationals. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=180.56s)]
*  So we'll continue to work towards this and make sure that there is apt flow each day. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=182.32s)]
*  So the Rafah crossing is open in both directions now? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=187.4s)]
*  That is our understanding. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=190.16000000000003s)]
*  As I said from here yesterday, that it had been closed given some security circumstances. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  Our understanding at this point is that it is open for the influx of aid and also for [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=198.44s)]
*  foreign nationals to depart. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=206.0s)]
*  And just on the humanitarian pause, so one of the images that people have been seeing [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=207.72000000000003s)]
*  a lot is a lot of people moving from the north of Gaza to the south. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  What's the U.S. position on how these people, will these people have some kind of right [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=217.67999999999998s)]
*  of return to their, a lot of them are already displaced people from many years anyway, but [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=225.28s)]
*  is there some way that you, in your talks with the Israelis, that you're able to say [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=232.68s)]
*  anyone who leaves northern Gaza, Gaza City now during this operation will have the right [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=237.68s)]
*  to return to where they were living before? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=243.0s)]
*  So you've heard me say this before, that of course a forced relocation of Palestinian [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=246.96s)]
*  civilians from Gaza is not something that we support. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=253.68s)]
*  It's not a policy that we are pursuing. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=258.56s)]
*  And additionally, Palestinian civilians who may call Gaza home, we believe should have [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=262.28s)]
*  the ability to return if they had needed to depart for whatever reason over the course [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=269.52s)]
*  of this conflict. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=276.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=277.96s)]
*  We're talking about people moving within, inside the Gaza Strip, but moving from north [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=278.96s)]
*  to south, right? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=282.44s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=283.44s)]
*  And what I'm saying, your question, for those who may have departed, I'm saying is that [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=284.44s)]
*  it's our belief that they should be able to return should they have exited for whatever [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=289.08s)]
*  reason. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=296.16s)]
*  Go ahead, Said. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=297.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=298.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=299.16s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=300.16s)]
*  So you're telling – I mean, your response to Simon. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=301.16s)]
*  You're saying that the U.S. does give an ironclad commitment or promise that these [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=304.16s)]
*  people will be able to return to homes from which they were forced to leave. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=309.52s)]
*  Said, it's not a border that we control or it's not really an area that we have [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=314.92s)]
*  jurisdiction. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=320.56s)]
*  So the premise of your question is a little – is a little misguided. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=321.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=324.56s)]
*  Let me explain it. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=325.56s)]
*  What I'm offering, Said, is what is – you're asking me what is our policy, and I'm sharing [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=326.56s)]
*  what our policy is, which is that we don't support the forced relocation of Palestinian [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=329.76s)]
*  civilians, and our belief is that Palestinians who may have had to depart Gaza for whatever [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=333.8s)]
*  reason should be able to return as they see fit. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=339.48s)]
*  As they see – so designer. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=344.68s)]
*  That's what I wanted to know, that they actually can return and you will help facilitate [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=345.68s)]
*  their return. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=350.68s)]
*  That's one point. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=351.68s)]
*  If you can. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=352.68s)]
*  Again, I would just say it is our belief that those who may have had to depart or who chose [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=353.68s)]
*  to depart are able to return. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=358.52000000000004s)]
*  Again, you've heard us be quite consistent about this from the Secretary and others, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=360.96000000000004s)]
*  that the forced relocation of Palestinian civilians from Gaza is not something that [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=364.6s)]
*  we're pursuing. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=368.88s)]
*  On the ceasefire, if I may – I mean, just follow up with a couple of questions. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=369.88s)]
*  On the ceasefire, four hours – do you believe that the four hours are sufficient to get [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=374.03999999999996s)]
*  the kind of aid that you want to get through? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=378.12s)]
*  Said, we believe that this is an important step in the right direction. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=380.64s)]
*  We believe that it is a byproduct of the U.S. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=385.35999999999996s)]
*  Government and this Administration's efforts in the region, diplomatically, what the President, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=388.91999999999996s)]
*  Secretary Blinken, and others have been doing around the clock. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=394.64s)]
*  Of course, we are going to continue to want to see more. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=397.88s)]
*  We have not parsed our words about the dire humanitarian circumstances in Gaza, and it's [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=401.8s)]
*  something that we're going to continue to engage on with the Israelis on what other [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=407.88s)]
*  avenues are available for ensuring access to humanitarian aid and humanitarian pauses [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=412.0s)]
*  that will allow for the safe movement of civilians. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=417.72s)]
*  This is a welcome step in the right direction, and we, of course, are going to continue to [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=422.0s)]
*  with our Israeli partners on what other avenues may be possible. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=428.40000000000003s)]
*  My last issue is Israel often – and you guys from this podium and other podiums – often [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=432.32000000000005s)]
*  accuse that Hamas is using people as a human shield and so on. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=439.24s)]
*  They were saying that in Shifa Hospital there was a photograph or surveillance of a manhole [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=443.6s)]
*  and turned out to be just for water. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=449.40000000000003s)]
*  Let me ask you something. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=451.12s)]
*  Do you have a definition to what is a human shield? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=452.12s)]
*  Well, I – it is important here when we sit – talk about this. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=455.4s)]
*  We don't – this isn't – and you've heard me say this before this week. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=460.28s)]
*  This is not hyperbole. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=463.4s)]
*  It is fact. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=465.56s)]
*  Hamas is a designated terrorist organization. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=466.56s)]
*  It's been a designated terrorist organization since 1997 and has been so over the course [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=469.36s)]
*  of multiple administrations of varying political parties. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=475.56s)]
*  And we know that there is a vast network of Hamas integrating itself through civilian [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=480.64s)]
*  infrastructure, co-locating itself with key civilian infrastructure, using Palestinian [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=488.0s)]
*  civilians as human shields by doing so, by co-locating itself in such ways. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=493.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=497.6s)]
*  I just want to remind you that this term was actually invented by Mahatma Gandhi when he [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=498.6s)]
*  was fighting the British. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=502.0s)]
*  But I'm not going to go into the history and so on. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=503.0s)]
*  But also I want to remind you that, in fact, in the Israeli-Palestinian context, it was [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=505.44s)]
*  the Israelis who introduced the term and the activity. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=510.04s)]
*  They would bring in the kids, tie them to the jeeps and so on – there are plenty of [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=513.36s)]
*  pictures that I can send you and share with everybody here – to disallow or to prevent [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=516.6s)]
*  the other kids from throwing stones at them. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=521.32s)]
*  Said, it's – it's – it's – it's – it's – let's not lose sight of the [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=523.16s)]
*  fact – let's not lose sight of the fact that Hamas has brought this war to Gaza. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=527.44s)]
*  And they are a terrorist organization that is hijacking the political future of the Palestinian [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=531.92s)]
*  people. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=537.4799999999999s)]
*  You know, Vedant, just my last point. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=538.4799999999999s)]
*  The Israeli Defense Ministry is really located in a densely populated area. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=541.4799999999999s)]
*  So if the situation was reversed and somebody somehow struck a rocket onto that thing and [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=547.1999999999999s)]
*  civilians were killed, would you call that a human shield? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=554.28s)]
*  Would you call that the Israeli Defense Ministry is practicing human shield? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=556.68s)]
*  In any circumstance in countries around the world, we have been incredibly clear about [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=561.24s)]
*  the moral imperative to ensure that steps are taken so that civilian casualties and [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=567.0799999999999s)]
*  impacts on civilians are minimized. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=572.8s)]
*  Not – [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=574.4399999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=575.4399999999999s)]
*  I'll come – can I come to you right after, Nick? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=576.4399999999999s)]
*  Nadia, go ahead. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=577.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=578.4399999999999s)]
*  Following up on this four-hour – on the 10-a-pill, the White House said that it's [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=579.4399999999999s)]
*  going to start today. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=583.4399999999999s)]
*  So it's like – [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=584.4399999999999s)]
*  You're at 8.30, I think, in the evening now in Gaza. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=585.4399999999999s)]
*  So do you still believe that it's going to start today, implement it today? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=587.9599999999999s)]
*  I have no – I have no different update. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=591.08s)]
*  That's our understanding. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=593.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=594.52s)]
*  Is Gaza City included in this four-hour pause? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=595.52s)]
*  I will let our Israeli partners speak to the specific operations about this, Nadia. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=597.84s)]
*  I'm not going to get into the operational details from up here. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=602.44s)]
*  Also, the Israeli defense minister just now said actually that they're not going to [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=605.9200000000001s)]
*  stop fighting. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=610.4000000000001s)]
*  So do we believe them or do we believe you and the White House that actually there is [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=612.12s)]
*  a four-hour humanitarian pause? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=616.6s)]
*  This was an announcement coming from the Israeli government, so I will let them clarify anything [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=618.4599999999999s)]
*  that needs to be clarified. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=626.02s)]
*  We don't speak on behalf of them. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=627.16s)]
*  What I will just say is that the announcement of this is reflective of work that our administration, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=629.6999999999999s)]
*  President Biden, Secretary Blinken, others, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan have [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=638.02s)]
*  been doing around the clock because of the critical role that we've been playing on [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=641.4599999999999s)]
*  the importance of ensuring the flow of humanitarian aid, ensuring that humanitarian pauses are [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=646.1800000000001s)]
*  possible so that voluntary movement of civilians is able to take place and potentially allow [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=652.1800000000001s)]
*  for the conditions to be created for hostages to be released. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=657.62s)]
*  There's going to be two corridors for people to go from north to south. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=660.4200000000001s)]
*  So when they leave via the sea or the other route, do you think – where are they supposed [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=664.5400000000001s)]
*  to go? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=670.4200000000001s)]
*  Because if we think there is no water, no electricity, so they're going to be in the [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=671.4200000000001s)]
*  open air? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=675.3s)]
*  I'm just – like, practical question. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=676.3s)]
*  I totally understand your question, and again, I will leave it to our Israeli partners to [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=677.54s)]
*  speak to the specifics about this. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=681.5799999999999s)]
*  And one final thing about the hostages. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=683.3s)]
*  And then a – okay, one final one. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=684.3s)]
*  Yeah, about the hostages. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=685.3s)]
*  Do you think that Islamic Jihad, who seems to be holding other hostages, not just Hamas, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=686.3s)]
*  is this other routes that the U.S. is following with mediation, maybe perhaps in Lebanon or [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=694.74s)]
*  elsewhere? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=699.8599999999999s)]
*  And are there other channels, not just through Egypt and Qatar? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=700.86s)]
*  I'm just not going to get into the ongoing and sensitive efforts. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=704.1s)]
*  We have actively been working to release all the hostages in Gaza, including those Americans. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=708.9s)]
*  And we've been clear that the U.S. supports humanitarian pauses to get hostages out, but [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=715.42s)]
*  I'm not going to get into the specifics of any of that. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=721.1800000000001s)]
*  I'm going to work. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=723.82s)]
*  Nick, go ahead. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=724.82s)]
*  Someone really underhanded that. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=725.82s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=726.82s)]
*  There are two negotiations for a three-day humanitarian pause for the release of about [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=727.82s)]
*  a dozen hostages, according to sources who are involved in those negotiations. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=732.1s)]
*  Is that in any way connected to these four-hour pauses that were announced today? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=736.9000000000001s)]
*  If so, how? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=740.94s)]
*  And if not, can you shed some light on the negotiations? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=741.94s)]
*  Our hope is that conditions can continue to be created that would eventually get us to [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=745.6600000000001s)]
*  a place where some of these hostages can be released. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=751.0400000000001s)]
*  The announcement that was today is about ensuring the flow of humanitarian aid, as well as allowing [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=755.1s)]
*  the ability for civilians to move safely and depart areas where there might be hostilities [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=762.74s)]
*  taking place. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=769.66s)]
*  But again, we've not, we'll continue to keep our eye on the ball when it comes to release [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=770.66s)]
*  of these hostages, and it's something that we'll continue to engage on with our Israeli [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=775.3s)]
*  partners. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=780.46s)]
*  Would the news from today or other humanitarian pauses that potentially could be forthcoming [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=781.46s)]
*  allow for the release of hostages? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=788.38s)]
*  That of course would be a step in the right direction also. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=790.26s)]
*  Camilla, go ahead. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=792.62s)]
*  Thank you, Redan. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=793.62s)]
*  We've reported that CIA Director Bill Burns is in Doha along with the head of Israel's [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=794.62s)]
*  Mossad. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=802.14s)]
*  Incidentally, they were there before this – before our humanitarian pauses was announced. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=803.14s)]
*  We've been told that he's there to – for various discussions, but also to facilitate [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=809.94s)]
*  hostage negotiations. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=816.22s)]
*  Just wondered if you could clarify on who's leading the charge on hostage negotiations [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=817.22s)]
*  on the U.S. side, and then I have one about fuel after that. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=821.42s)]
*  So first and foremost, I'd defer to the Central Intelligence Agency to speak to the [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=823.86s)]
*  director's travels. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=829.26s)]
*  What I will say is that across the interagency, this is a – continues to be a priority for [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=831.1s)]
*  our government. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=836.66s)]
*  It's what I mentioned yesterday why Deputy Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=837.74s)]
*  Steve Gillan remains in Israel, and this is something this department and other pieces [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=843.2199999999999s)]
*  of the U.S. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=849.26s)]
*  Government continue to engage on extensively. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=850.26s)]
*  And just on fuel, Ambassador Satterfield briefed reporters a little earlier today. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=852.2199999999999s)]
*  He says that there's now fuel available to UN implementers in Gaza and that they hope [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=858.26s)]
*  that he's hoping that more fuel will be able to get in for other aid workers. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=864.2199999999999s)]
*  That effort to get more fuel in, is that hope that that goes alongside the four-hour pauses [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=867.3s)]
*  that have just been announced, or is that a separate effort from the pauses that have [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=873.78s)]
*  just been announced? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=876.9399999999999s)]
*  So the mechanical and technical way in which we would ensure the access to fuel, I'm [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=877.9399999999999s)]
*  just not going to comment on that given sort of the technical and operational specifications. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=884.06s)]
*  What I will just say is that we know very clearly that there is a dire need for fuel [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=889.5s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=893.98s)]
*  It is key to a number of lines of efforts, whether that be desalination of water, clean [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=894.98s)]
*  water treatment, other wastewater efforts, the provision of medical care, and that is [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=900.86s)]
*  exactly why Special Envoy Satterfield has been engaged on this, to do everything we [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=906.5s)]
*  can in close coordination with Egyptian authorities, Israeli authorities, donors, humanitarian aid [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=911.0600000000001s)]
*  agencies, to turn that – to do whatever we can to increase that. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=916.46s)]
*  Barbara, go ahead. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=921.46s)]
*  Similar kind of question, actually. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=922.46s)]
*  So the IDF has been quite clear that these are tactical, local pauses for movement from [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=924.82s)]
*  a specific area to the south, which sounds like from the Israeli point of view they're [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=929.7800000000001s)]
*  completely focused on getting or allowing Palestinians to leave northern Gaza to southern [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=935.22s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=941.0600000000001s)]
*  Do you – in what way do you think or can you say anything about how this might be expanded [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=942.2199999999999s)]
*  to aid? [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=949.14s)]
*  Like, it doesn't sound like it has anything to do with the aid side of it. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=950.14s)]
*  So I guess, and similar to what Kamila was asking, but how do you see this moving towards [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=953.42s)]
*  getting aid? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=959.7399999999999s)]
*  The hope is, Barbara, the hope is that through these pauses, through these hours and movements [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=960.7399999999999s)]
*  that are going to be taking place, that aid is able to reach those who need it and the [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=967.86s)]
*  conditions will be created to not just allow for the additional flow of aid through the [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=975.14s)]
*  Ra'afa crossing, but also to those civilians who may be using that time to move, that aid [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=981.26s)]
*  is able to get to them as well. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=988.26s)]
*  Again, I will leave it to our Israeli partners to speak specifically about the operational [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=989.86s)]
*  details of this, but we believe that this is an important step in the right direction [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=995.78s)]
*  that simultaneously will allow Israel to continue to hold Hamas accountable for these October [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1000.66s)]
*  7 terrorist attacks. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1006.98s)]
*  Michel, go ahead. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1008.54s)]
*  QUESTION. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1009.54s)]
*  They don't – first, any U.S. official will participate in the Arab and Islamic summits [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1010.54s)]
*  that will be held in Saudi Arabia, and what do you expect from these summits? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1016.3s)]
*  MR. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1020.9s)]
*  RATHKE. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1021.9s)]
*  Michel, those summits are being held as part of our – at least our understanding, the [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1022.9s)]
*  Arab League and the Organization of Islamic States. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1026.3s)]
*  The United States is not an observer or a member of either of those entities, so I don't [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1029.74s)]
*  expect any participation from the United States of America. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1034.06s)]
*  But we'll be, of course, paying close attention and I'm not going to get ahead of that process. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1037.74s)]
*  QUESTION. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1042.46s)]
*  And one more – more attacks today on U.S. military bases in Iraq after the U.S. reaction [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1043.46s)]
*  yesterday in Syria. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1048.94s)]
*  Any comment? [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1051.02s)]
*  MR. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1052.02s)]
*  RATHKE. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1053.02s)]
*  So since you asked, Michel, U.S. fighter aircraft conducted a proportionate, precision self-defense [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1054.02s)]
*  airstrike in eastern Syria against one facility used by Iran's IRGC and affiliated groups. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1060.3799999999999s)]
*  The IRGC and affiliated groups recently directed attacks on U.S. and coalition bases in Iraq [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1068.54s)]
*  and Syria. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1074.86s)]
*  And as I have said from this podium over the course of the week, we will continue to take [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1076.06s)]
*  decisive military action to defend U.S. personnel in the region. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1080.1s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1084.78s)]
*  QUESTION. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1086.38s)]
*  Thank you, Vedant. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1087.38s)]
*  Especially after the announcement of – for our military impasse in northern Gaza today, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1088.38s)]
*  which would allow people to move to the south, there are some concerns about the integrity [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1094.58s)]
*  of Gaza. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1099.38s)]
*  Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas also today said that any move by Israel to divide Gaza [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1100.98s)]
*  into two sections is unacceptable. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1108.74s)]
*  I was wondering how can you address those concerns, and do you share similar concerns [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1112.5400000000002s)]
*  about the territorial integrity of Gaza? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1117.22s)]
*  MR. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1119.9s)]
*  RATHKE. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1120.9s)]
*  Rabia, I assume you saw the Secretary's comments in Tokyo yesterday morning, and I [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1121.9s)]
*  think it was a very clear laydown of what we see as steps that can be taken to ensure [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1127.58s)]
*  that this crisis never happens again, and that is setting conditions for durable peace [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1136.58s)]
*  and security. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1141.54s)]
*  And of course, part of that is considering and thinking about the future of Gaza. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1142.54s)]
*  And I've just was very clear that first no forcible displacement of Palestinians from [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1148.26s)]
*  Gaza continues to be something that we feel very strongly about. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1153.6599999999999s)]
*  We also feel strongly that Gaza cannot be a platform for terrorism or other violent [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1159.62s)]
*  attacks. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1165.34s)]
*  We also feel that no reoccupation of Gaza after the conflict ends is something that [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1166.34s)]
*  can happen either, as well as no attempt to blockade or besiege Gaza. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1173.1s)]
*  So we think that these are principles that will help set the conditions for a durable [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1179.26s)]
*  peace and security for the region. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1184.42s)]
*  Sure. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1186.42s)]
*  Q I have one more, please. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1187.42s)]
*  I wanted to ask if you have any comments on Israeli War Cabinet Minister Benny Gatt's [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1188.42s)]
*  remarks today in which – in a tweet, he said journalists who covered the October 7 [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1194.06s)]
*  attack and did not intervene, quote, unquote, are no different than terrorists and should [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1200.3799999999999s)]
*  be treated as such. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1206.02s)]
*  Do you have any reactions on that? [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1207.5s)]
*  MR TONER I've not seen those comments, so I don't have any immediate reaction to offer [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1209.78s)]
*  you for that. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1214.1000000000001s)]
*  Sam, go ahead. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1215.1000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1216.1000000000001s)]
*  You just said you're for a durable peace and security and you want Israel to abide [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1217.1000000000001s)]
*  by international law. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1224.1000000000001s)]
*  And then pick up where I left off yesterday. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1225.1000000000001s)]
*  Does the U.S. recognize the Fourth Geneva Convention as applying to Gaza and the West [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1227.8600000000001s)]
*  Bank? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1232.06s)]
*  I'm not going to get into the specifics of the legal aspects of this. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1233.1399999999999s)]
*  I would have to double-check for you. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1238.46s)]
*  But what I will just say is that we have made clear – [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1240.02s)]
*  I want to take up a lot of time if we're going to just repeat. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1244.78s)]
*  Great. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1246.26s)]
*  We can – [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1247.26s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1248.26s)]
*  I mean, I'd like to move on if I were going to – [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1249.26s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1250.26s)]
*  Wonderful. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1251.26s)]
*  If you're just going to repeat. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1252.26s)]
*  It has been longstanding U.S. policy that the Fourth Geneva Convention does apply. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1253.26s)]
*  Indeed, if the Fourth Geneva Convention doesn't apply, it's not clear to me what legal constraints [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1256.5s)]
*  there are on Israel. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1261.22s)]
*  The Hansel memo was issued by Cyrus Vance when he was Secretary of State. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1262.5s)]
*  That was U.S. policy. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1266.78s)]
*  That's been U.S. policy. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1267.78s)]
*  Pompeo seems to have said we're not going to abide by this. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1269.58s)]
*  Has this State Department – has the Biden-Blinken State Department effectively abrogated decades [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1274.26s)]
*  of U.S. policy and adopted the Pompeo policy on this question? [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1281.14s)]
*  I'm not sure what you're referring to, but I – [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1285.5s)]
*  I understand what the Hansel memo is, but I'm asking what your question – [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1291.78s)]
*  Does it still apply? [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1296.26s)]
*  Does this State Department still abide by the Hansel memo? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1298.26s)]
*  We have had no change in policy as it relates to the Hansel memo, which is something that [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1300.82s)]
*  Matt has spoken to a number of months ago as well. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1304.8999999999999s)]
*  But let me just reiterate, Sam, that this – we have – from the forefront of this [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1309.26s)]
*  conflict, we have talked about very clearly the need for ensuring that this military observation [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1316.6999999999998s)]
*  is conducted in accordance with international law. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1323.6599999999999s)]
*  That's something we continue to talk about. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1326.3s)]
*  We continue to abide by that today. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1328.4199999999998s)]
*  But which law – which law? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1332.26s)]
*  The Fortunyva Convention or not? [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1334.82s)]
*  Go ahead, Alex. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1336.1799999999998s)]
*  Which law? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1337.1799999999998s)]
*  It's a free fire zone if you're not going to abide by the Fortunyva Convention. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1338.1799999999998s)]
*  Go ahead, Alex. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1340.86s)]
*  I said – [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1341.86s)]
*  Which law? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1342.86s)]
*  You're creating the legal construct for the – [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1343.86s)]
*  I'm sure we've taken two – if you're going to interrupt your colleagues, I'm [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1344.9399999999998s)]
*  going to ask you to leave. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1347.1399999999999s)]
*  No, no, I'm interrupting you. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1348.1399999999999s)]
*  I – the rest of the room has questions that they would like to get to. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1349.1399999999999s)]
*  I'm sure they do, but the – [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1352.82s)]
*  I've taken your question every day of this week. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1353.82s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1356.54s)]
*  Alex, please go ahead. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1357.54s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1358.54s)]
*  I just haven't gotten an answer. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1359.54s)]
*  Please go ahead, Alex. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1360.54s)]
*  Thanks, Matt. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1361.54s)]
*  I wanted to – I'm going to push on the corridor issue. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1362.54s)]
*  Sure. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1363.54s)]
*  We were told by the White House this morning that the first corridor has been in use, right? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1364.54s)]
*  I mean, what's new here? [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1368.54s)]
*  Is it just about the time period that is new or – because it has been used for multiple [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1370.14s)]
*  days now. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1376.8200000000002s)]
*  There was this announcement of this additional corridor, as well as some of the specific [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1377.8200000000002s)]
*  updates that we're sharing, which again, our Israeli partners can talk to you in more [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1383.5800000000002s)]
*  detail about. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1386.66s)]
*  We were told from the get-go that the Gaza test toll cannot be trusted, assuming that [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1387.66s)]
*  Hamas group is interested in exaggerating those numbers. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1393.74s)]
*  Today we are hearing from Assistant Secretary Barbara Leaf on the Hill. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1398.46s)]
*  She said that those numbers are apparently higher than what they are being announced. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1402.3s)]
*  Is that your final assessment? [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1409.74s)]
*  And if so, how do you want us to swallow that? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1410.74s)]
*  Alex, the important thing to remember here is – let me say a couple things. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1413.74s)]
*  First, any number over zero when it comes to civilian casualties is heartbreaking. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1420.78s)]
*  These are – they represent the losses of futures, the losses of potential, the loss [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1430.22s)]
*  of dreams. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1436.5s)]
*  When we are talking about the Hamas-run Ministry of Health, what we are saying is that this [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1438.38s)]
*  is a group that has a track record of being untruthful when it comes to civilian casualties. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1444.3s)]
*  We are in no way trying to imply that there has not been an impact on civilians and that [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1454.22s)]
*  there has not been a significant amount of civilian lives lost in Gaza because of this [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1460.78s)]
*  conflict. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1467.82s)]
*  We have been clear-eyed about that and we have not been naive about the impact that [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1470.4199999999998s)]
*  this has had on civilians. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1474.9399999999998s)]
*  What we were speaking about before, Alex, again, is just that this is a group that is [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1477.74s)]
*  run by Hamas that has a track record of being untruthful about the numbers. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1482.6999999999998s)]
*  But we take issue with any of these numbers being above zero. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1486.8999999999999s)]
*  One civilian life lost is too much. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1491.62s)]
*  One civilian life lost is going too far. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1494.4199999999998s)]
*  And that is why we are taking steps to ensure in close coordination with our Israeli partners [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1498.3799999999999s)]
*  that conditions can be created to minimize civilian casualties. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1504.54s)]
*  The humanitarian pauses announced earlier this morning are a welcome step in that direction. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1508.98s)]
*  QUESTION. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1514.4199999999998s)]
*  But is it the final assessment that actual number is higher than the 10,000? [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1515.4199999999998s)]
*  MR. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1518.8999999999999s)]
*  RATHKE. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1519.8999999999999s)]
*  I have no reason to dispute what Assistant Secretary Leaf said. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1520.8999999999999s)]
*  I have not seen those comments. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1522.98s)]
*  I was not participating in that congressional hearing, but I'm happy to check back specifically [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1524.26s)]
*  for you. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1529.26s)]
*  Sure. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1530.26s)]
*  Bar. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1531.26s)]
*  Actually, I came to you already. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1532.26s)]
*  Sure. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1535.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1536.26s)]
*  QUESTION. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1537.26s)]
*  Follow-up to what he – it was a quick follow-up to what he – yes. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1538.26s)]
*  So just to clarify, you said that the Hamas-run ministry of health has a track record of [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1539.26s)]
*  being untruthful. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1542.22s)]
*  I just wonder if you could elaborate on that, because the UN has been using their numbers. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1543.22s)]
*  And in fact, I believe the State Department has used their numbers for its reports before [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1546.54s)]
*  as well. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1549.78s)]
*  So what's the track record here? [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1550.78s)]
*  MR. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1551.78s)]
*  RATHKE. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1552.78s)]
*  I don't know if you're absent at – yeah. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1553.78s)]
*  So there is not a different entity conducting this – a count of this metric right now. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1554.78s)]
*  And so it is a number the UN uses. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1564.66s)]
*  It's the number the State Department uses in its own internal site-writ and things of [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1566.22s)]
*  that nature. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1570.82s)]
*  That does not necessarily mean that it is a number that is wholly accurate. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1571.82s)]
*  But again, the important – [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1577.52s)]
*  MS. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1578.52s)]
*  HARF. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1579.52s)]
*  The important takeaway here, Barbara, is that any number above zero is something that we [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1580.52s)]
*  will continue to take issue with. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1588.24s)]
*  But again, there is not – unless the BBC is aware of something that I'm not, there [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1590.92s)]
*  is not a separate entity conducting a count for civilian casualties in Gaza aside from [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1595.2s)]
*  the ministry of health that is run by Hamas. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1601.92s)]
*  that we will continue to use internally. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1605.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1608.44s)]
*  MS. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1609.44s)]
*  HARF. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1610.44s)]
*  Sorry, guys, but all in the previous wars that Hamas were accurate, actually, in the [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1611.44s)]
*  numbers, why do you think this time they're not accurate? [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1614.28s)]
*  MR. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1616.64s)]
*  RATHKE. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1617.64s)]
*  We're just not going to get into the specific intelligence assessments, Nadia, but we have [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1618.64s)]
*  seen reporting especially around the attack on the hospital in Gaza where there has been [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1621.04s)]
*  misinformation and some of the casualty figures have been misreported. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1628.8400000000001s)]
*  Again, this is not to minimize the impact that there has been on civilian casualties [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1633.52s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1639.12s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1640.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1641.12s)]
*  QUESTION. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1642.12s)]
*  Thank you, Abed. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1643.12s)]
*  And just please, because it's a little bit confusing, today the announcement of humanitarian [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1644.12s)]
*  causes is interpreted like a breakthrough. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1648.32s)]
*  I mean, what – if you can walk us through the difference between what's happening [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1652.08s)]
*  now, because we are seeing humanitarian aid entering to Gaza, some civilians are able [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1656.6399999999999s)]
*  to depart, but they are not safe all the time. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1662.3999999999999s)]
*  So is it a breakthrough? [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1665.84s)]
*  I mean, and what's the difference between what you announced today and what we are looking [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1667.24s)]
*  or waiting for in a potential deal on hostage three days of humanitarian causes? [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1672.56s)]
*  MR. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1679.32s)]
*  RATHKE. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1680.32s)]
*  We think that this is a result of our diplomacy and our engagement in the region, and this [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1681.32s)]
*  is something that the Secretary of State, President Biden, Jake Sullivan, others have [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1685.32s)]
*  very director about with their counterparts in the Israeli Government about the need for [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1690.08s)]
*  pauses and efforts like this. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1695.1999999999998s)]
*  Yes, there has been humanitarian aid flowing into Gaza. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1697.1999999999998s)]
*  Yes, there has been the ability for Palestinian civilians and foreign nationals to be able [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1700.56s)]
*  to not just move within Gaza, but also those who have an intended wish to do so to depart [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1706.0s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1712.04s)]
*  What this is about is our Israeli partners sharing with some more specificity about efforts [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1713.04s)]
*  that had already been underway, but also some additional efforts that they are pursuing [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1718.6399999999999s)]
*  to ensure that these things can happen. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1722.8799999999999s)]
*  And I will let them speak to those details in more specificity. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1725.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1728.08s)]
*  QUESTION. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1729.08s)]
*  One more question, if I may. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1730.08s)]
*  You've been saying that ISIS fire is only beneficial for Hamas. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1731.08s)]
*  Do you assess that the current situation is beneficial for Israel militarily and strategically [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1735.56s)]
*  speaking? [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1743.56s)]
*  I'm not just – I'm not going to opine or comment on the specifics of the military [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1744.56s)]
*  operation. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1749.56s)]
*  What this is about is ensuring that Hamas is never able to repeat the attacks of October [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1750.56s)]
*  7th again, which is what a unilateral ceasefire would allow them to do, allow them to regroup, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1758.9199999999998s)]
*  re-strengthen themselves, position themselves to carry out its stated intent of continuing [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1765.1599999999999s)]
*  to attack violently against the Israeli people. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1772.24s)]
*  Coyle, go ahead. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1775.24s)]
*  QUESTION. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1776.24s)]
*  Thanks, sir. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1777.24s)]
*  Two questions, please. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1778.24s)]
*  One, as far as Secretary's visit to India is concerned, if there were issues discussed [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1779.24s)]
*  like these terrorist organizations, they keep attacking like India, 26, 11, 9-11 U.S., and [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1785.96s)]
*  now 7-10 in Israel, among other countries, and they keep changing their names. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1792.96s)]
*  You can ban them, sanction them, anything you can do. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1798.0s)]
*  So where do we go from here? [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1801.48s)]
*  Future – then they will hold innocent hostages and then they want to trade them in. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1803.08s)]
*  MR ZELTAKALNS. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1808.4s)]
*  Secretary Blinken is heading to New Delhi as part of the two-plus-two security dialogue [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1809.4s)]
*  with Secretary Austin, and so I have no doubt deepening our security cooperation will be [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1813.24s)]
*  a topic that is discussed by Secretary Blinken, Secretary Austin, and their counterparts in [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1817.8600000000001s)]
*  the Ministry of External Affairs and Ministry of Defense. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1824.24s)]
*  trip take out – play out before we share further. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1828.32s)]
*  But I have no doubt that cooperation, especially in the counterterrorism space, is something [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1831.76s)]
*  that will come up in areas where we can potentially deepen our partnership. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1837.6399999999999s)]
*  Follow-up, Coyle. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1841.6799999999998s)]
*  QUESTION. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1842.6799999999998s)]
*  Second question, sir. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1843.6799999999998s)]
*  As far as the nuclear weapons of Pakistan are concerned, one minister in Pakistan said [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1844.6799999999998s)]
*  that we are not obligated not to sell Ukraine nuclear weapons because we have not signed [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1848.32s)]
*  NPT. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1854.32s)]
*  And because of the cash flow problem in Pakistan, there is a discussion between Ukraine and [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1855.72s)]
*  Pakistan because ministers were met in – they met in Pakistan. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1862.6399999999999s)]
*  So what do you have any – about these comments? [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1867.04s)]
*  MR ZELTAKALNS. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1868.6399999999999s)]

*  not obligated to any international pressure because we have not signed NPT. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1875.96s)]
*  I have not seen that report, and so I'm not just going to hold back on commenting [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1882.76s)]
*  on it until I do. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1889.04s)]
*  MR ZELTAKALNS. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1890.04s)]
*  Can I ask about – [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1891.04s)]

*  Thank you so much about Southeast Asia. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1896.04s)]
*  What I want to ask you that before I ask you, let me tell you that with the support of USA, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1897.04s)]
*  Bangladesh Government took a zero-tolerance policy in combating terrorism and radicalism. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1898.9599999999998s)]
*  Media reporting their achievement positively contributes to the counterterrorism effort [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1904.36s)]
*  and national interest of USA. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1908.8s)]
*  How do you evaluate the achievement of the current government about this matter? [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1910.72s)]
*  MR ZELTAKALNS. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1915.0s)]
*  So I will speak about this in broad terms that you've heard me say before, that last [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1916.0s)]
*  year we celebrated 50 years of diplomatic relations with Bangladesh, and of course that [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1922.84s)]
*  this is a country that we're looking to continue to deepen our relationships and partnerships [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1929.68s)]
*  with as there continue to be a number of areas, including trade, cooperation in the climate [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1934.8s)]
*  space, cooperation in the security space, and otherwise, where that potential exists. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1939.88s)]
*  QUESTION. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1943.8400000000001s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1944.8400000000001s)]
*  I have one line question. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1945.8400000000001s)]
*  Do you support the unelected caretaker government in Bangladesh as opposition demanding before [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1947.3200000000002s)]
*  the general election? [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1953.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1954.0s)]
*  MR ZELTAKALNS. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1955.0s)]
*  I'm pretty sure I answered this question yesterday or the day before that, or the day [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1956.0s)]
*  before that. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1958.44s)]
*  So to – [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1959.44s)]
*  QUESTION. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1960.44s)]
*  We are getting answered every time that you – everybody wants in Bangladesh free and [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1961.44s)]
*  fair election. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1965.1200000000001s)]
*  is if you support an elected caretaker government on – yes or no? [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1967.12s)]
*  MR ZELTAKALNS. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1971.1999999999998s)]
*  As you've heard us say, we do not support a particular government or a political party [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1972.1999999999998s)]
*  or candidate in any country in that – in areas where there are elections ongoing, we [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1976.4399999999998s)]
*  – our goal and intent is for these elections to take place in a free and fair way that [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1982.36s)]
*  respect the will of the people of that country. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1988.08s)]
*  Go ahead, in the back. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1990.04s)]
*  QUESTION. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1991.04s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1992.04s)]
*  During a press conference in Seoul, Secretary Blinken said that the United States is singing [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1993.12s)]
*  and witnessing Russia providing technology and support to North Korea for its military [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=1997.84s)]
*  programs. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2002.84s)]
*  So I'm wondering, can you give us more clarity on what support and what technology is being [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2003.84s)]
*  provided to North Korea? [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2009.1599999999999s)]
*  I have another question. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2010.52s)]
*  Is – what – okay. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2011.52s)]
*  MR ZELTAKALNS. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2012.52s)]
*  Sure. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2013.52s)]
*  Oh, no, why don't you ask your second question? [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2014.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2015.52s)]
*  The second question is when it comes to North Korea, the policy focus has always been like [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2016.52s)]
*  deterrence and sanctions enforcement. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2019.56s)]
*  The U.S. obviously has stressed its intent to re-engage with North Korea, but I'm wondering [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2022.44s)]
*  if there are any behind-the-scenes efforts underway to kickstart direct engagement with [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2027.16s)]
*  North Korea at this point. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2034.4s)]
*  MR RATHKE. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2035.4s)]
*  So this is, of course, something that our Special Representative Sung Kim is deeply [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2036.4s)]
*  engaged on. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2040.64s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2041.64s)]
*  We have been clear-eyed that our intent and goal for the Korean Peninsula is a complete [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2043.0s)]
*  denuclearization, and we have been upfront with Pyongyang about our willingness to engage [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2048.96s)]
*  in diplomacy without preconditions. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2055.32s)]
*  And that continues to be the case. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2057.7200000000003s)]
*  Specifically as it relates to the Secretary's comments, I don't have any additional specifics [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2060.1200000000003s)]
*  to provide, but we have seen a track record of countries like Russia continue to carry [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2063.86s)]
*  the DPRK's water, especially in forums like the United Nations Security Council. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2071.84s)]
*  And our belief is, is that any country that claims to have relationships with the DPRK [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2078.12s)]
*  or influence over the DPRK has a responsibility to make clear to them that their actions continue [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2085.12s)]
*  to be destabilizing, that they continue to violate a number of sanctions, that their [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2092.2799999999997s)]
*  activities continue to be in violation of a number of UN Security Council resolutions [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2097.2s)]
*  also. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2102.56s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2103.56s)]
*  We'll come back to you, Alex. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2104.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2105.56s)]
*  There's a growing concern in Ukraine today, also echoed by President Zelensky, that the [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2106.64s)]
*  war in the Middle East between Israel and Gaza has distracted attention from Russia's [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2111.56s)]
*  brutal actions in Ukraine. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2117.24s)]
*  Do you share those concerns? [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2118.72s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2120.7999999999997s)]
*  We continue to be able to keep focused on the varying challenges that exist around the [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2122.24s)]
*  planet. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2129.7999999999997s)]
*  That, of course, also includes Russia's ongoing assault on Ukraine. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2130.7999999999997s)]
*  It was just a number of weeks ago, Alex, I think even last week or the week before, [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2136.24s)]
*  where we announced yet another tranche of security assistance for our Ukrainian partners. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2140.24s)]
*  And this is something that will continue to be focused on. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2146.2799999999997s)]
*  In President Biden's Oval Office address, he talked about the importance of not just, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2149.4799999999996s)]
*  of course, ensuring that Israel has what it needs to defend its security, but also that [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2154.9199999999996s)]
*  our Ukrainian partners continue the support that they have been getting so that they can [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2159.0s)]
*  continue to defend themselves against the infringement on their territorial integrity [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2165.0s)]
*  and sovereignty. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2169.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2170.44s)]
*  I have a second topic, a final one. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2171.44s)]
*  Sure. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2172.44s)]
*  The President yesterday proclaimed November 9 as International War Freedom Day, and he [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2173.44s)]
*  pledged that his administration will support human rights everywhere around the world. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2177.68s)]
*  I'm just curious, how does it – how does it going to look – how is it going to look [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2182.16s)]
*  like on your end at the State Department? [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2186.2s)]
*  Are you guys going to beef up your toolkit when it comes to human rights? [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2189.08s)]
*  Who said that? [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2193.2400000000002s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2194.3199999999997s)]
*  The President yesterday announced November 9 as a War Freedom Day, and you said he's [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2195.3199999999997s)]
*  not. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2198.3199999999997s)]
*  Well, Alex, one of the first things that Secretary Blinken, President Biden, Vice President Harris [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2199.3199999999997s)]
*  made clear at the beginning of this administration was the role that human rights is going to [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2204.08s)]
*  continue to play in the forefront at which we put it when it comes to our foreign policy. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2210.24s)]
*  And that will continue to be the case. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2216.12s)]
*  Around the world, when we have seen infringements on human rights, we have been clear about [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2218.2s)]
*  that. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2224.2s)]
*  From this very briefing room, Secretary Blinken regularly comes down to talk about the Department's [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2225.2s)]
*  annual human rights report and the conditions of human rights in varying countries and the [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2231.24s)]
*  steps the United States can take to address those. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2236.6s)]
*  So it's something that will continue to be focused. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2239.0s)]
*  Camilla. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2240.7999999999997s)]
*  Thanks, Renata. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2241.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2242.7999999999997s)]
*  Stepping back to Israel, Gaza, but on this building, today's CBS reported that senior [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2243.7999999999997s)]
*  State Department officials have held so-called listening sessions for diplomats in six U.S. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2248.04s)]
*  embassies in the Middle East and North Africa to be able to address any concerns amongst [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2253.36s)]
*  diplomats about U.S. policy, but also any concerns related to the background of diplomats. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2258.28s)]
*  Can you comment on this at all? [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2265.0s)]
*  And can you give any more information about ongoing efforts in this building to deal with [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2266.6800000000003s)]
*  any concerns or dissent among State Department staff as this conflict continues? [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2270.28s)]
*  Thanks, Camilla. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2275.28s)]
*  So out of respect to this process and out of respect to the workforce, I will talk about [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2276.28s)]
*  this in a little bit more broad terms than the specific engagements, but broadly I would [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2284.0s)]
*  just say yes. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2290.2000000000003s)]
*  It has been incredibly important for Secretary Blinken and this Department's leadership [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2291.2000000000003s)]
*  to be able to engage directly with the workforce on a variety of areas, first and foremost [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2296.8s)]

*  in the federal government should they be interested in taking advantage of some of those resources. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2313.2s)]
*  Additionally, we also recognize that this has been a trying time for our workforce around [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2319.68s)]
*  the country, and so just as we would here in D.C., we've ensured that our missions [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2327.96s)]
*  around the world, particularly those that might be more heightened attention right now [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2334.7999999999997s)]
*  to what's happening in the Middle East, have access to those resources and are able [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2341.56s)]
*  to interface with the department leaders about not just what's happening in the region [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2346.3999999999996s)]
*  but the ways that this department can continue to serve them. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2350.4399999999996s)]
*  Michel, go ahead. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2355.4399999999996s)]
*  What's your understanding of the photojournalists who took footage for the October 7 attacks [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2358.36s)]
*  in Gaza? [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2365.36s)]
*  I've seen those reports, Michel, and I just don't have any comment to offer on those [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2366.36s)]
*  right now. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2370.52s)]
*  Nalia, go ahead. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2371.52s)]
*  So the President apparently just told reporters now that he was asking for a longer humanitarian [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2372.52s)]
*  pause in Gaza. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2378.28s)]
*  So do you think that with $14 billion that you give them plus the 4 billion plus all [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2381.08s)]
*  the weapons, the President cannot get what he wants from the Israelis? [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2386.24s)]
*  Cannot even extend it beyond three days? [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2391.16s)]
*  Nalia, the announcement that was made public today is something that this administration, [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2393.2s)]
*  including the President, including the Secretary, it's something that they wanted to, of course, [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2398.92s)]
*  see happen. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2403.6s)]
*  But as I said when speaking to Nick and Simon, this is not a moment in time, black and white. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2404.6s)]
*  This happened and therefore another step can't be taken. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2411.52s)]
*  We will continue to work directly with our Israeli partners as we have about what other [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2415.68s)]
*  options are available to ensure the flow of humanitarian aid, to ensure that civilians [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2421.22s)]
*  are able to be kept out of harm's way. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2426.08s)]
*  That's something that we're going to continue to work towards. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2428.2s)]
*  Do you feel frustrated that you don't get more than, like, four hours, three hours a [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2430.16s)]
*  day? [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2434.3599999999997s)]
*  Do you want more since the President said he wants more? [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2435.3599999999997s)]
*  Today's announcement was a welcome step, and we are – we have never taken our foot [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2436.3599999999997s)]
*  continue to work directly with partners in the region about the seriousness we place [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2442.34s)]
*  on the flow of humanitarian aid. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2448.02s)]
*  Michail. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2450.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2451.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2452.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2453.02s)]
*  Thank you very much, Abbas. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2454.02s)]
*  You said many times the last two days that you are against the occupation of Gaza by [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2455.02s)]
*  the Israelis. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2459.3s)]
*  Before – but everybody forgot it, I think – you said that you are against the occupation [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2460.3s)]
*  of Ukraine by the Russians, and in my opinion, you are very right to say that. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2467.34s)]
*  But can we say that you are also against all the occupations in the world? [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2473.02s)]
*  For example, of the occupation of Cyprus by your allies, the Turks? [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2478.26s)]
*  Michail, each circumstance is different, and it would be inappropriate for me to offer [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2484.86s)]
*  strong comment like that on every case of the – case across the world. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2493.02s)]
*  Another question, please. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2497.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2498.46s)]
*  Do you have any good news maybe to share with us about Sweden joining NATO? [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2499.46s)]
*  For example, can you tell us if Hungary has removed the obstacles, if Turkey removes the [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2502.46s)]
*  obstacles? [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2513.46s)]
*  Any news? [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2514.46s)]
*  I think that our diplomats in Ankara and Hungary are continuing to work around the clock. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2516.46s)]
*  The Secretary raised this with Foreign Minister Fidan on his travels. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2522.58s)]
*  Of course, this is something – we have not held back the importance that we have placed [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2527.14s)]
*  on seeing that Sweden ascend to NATO as swiftly as possible. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2532.82s)]
*  We have long felt that the conditions laid out under the Trilateral Memorandum of Understanding [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2537.3s)]
*  under the Madrid Summit have been met and that Sweden is ready to be a NATO ally. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2543.7s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2549.54s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2550.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2551.54s)]
*  The question is about Russia and Latin America. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2552.54s)]
*  Sure. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2554.1s)]
*  Two days ago, the State Department alerted about a disinformation campaign happening [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2555.1s)]
*  in different media markets in Latin America with nefarious purposes allegedly by Russia. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2560.1s)]
*  Can you detail the specific media markets that you are worried about and the nature [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2567.58s)]
*  of this campaign? [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2571.18s)]
*  I'm happy to check with the Global Engagement Center about specifics that we can share. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2573.2599999999998s)]
*  We can follow up with you on that. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2577.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2578.18s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2579.18s)]
*  Thank you for taking the question. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2580.18s)]
*  So I have some questions about the upcoming APEC summit. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2581.18s)]
*  So I know that you guys don't want to get ahead of the President and the Secretary's [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2586.66s)]
*  schedule, but I'm wondering if you can share some details about what might be the top topics [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2592.06s)]
*  or issues that can come up during the summit, especially with regard to the meeting between [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2598.06s)]
*  President Biden and the Chinese leader Xi Jinping. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2605.58s)]
*  Well, you're right. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2610.58s)]
*  I'm absolutely not going to get ahead of the President's schedule or the Secretary's [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2611.58s)]
*  own schedule as well, but let me just say that we are thrilled to be serving as APEC's [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2615.26s)]
*  host this year, and the Leaders Week is going to mark the culmination of our efforts as [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2622.94s)]
*  it relates to APEC, and we have been focused on showcasing and highlighting our economic [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2630.06s)]
*  leadership as well as our commitment to multilateral engagement in the Asia Pacific and the world [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2636.94s)]
*  broadly, and we believe that APEC is an opportunity to highlight the direct benefits of the international [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2642.7s)]
*  economic engagement and some of the things that the United States has been [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2650.18s)]
*  leading on. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2654.18s)]
*  So I would say tune in next week and we'll have more to share over the course of the summit. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2654.74s)]
*  Secondly, so reportedly, the President Xi and President Biden, the meeting between them will [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2661.62s)]
*  result in an announcement to resume military-to-military communication between the two countries. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2673.86s)]
*  Is that the case? Can you confirm if — [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2681.46s)]
*  Again, I think I just said I'm not going to speak to the President or the Secretary's schedule. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2683.94s)]
*  I will leave it to the White House to announce any plans for the President. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2687.7s)]
*  So — [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2692.02s)]
*  If I may — [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2692.58s)]
*  I mean, you got two questions already. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2693.62s)]
*  Go ahead, please, from the back. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2695.38s)]
*  Thanks. Back to Palestine, Israel. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights yesterday [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2696.42s)]
*  said that the, quote-unquote, the atrocities perpetrated by Palestinian armed groups on [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2702.2599999999998s)]
*  October 7th were heinous. They were war crimes. He also said the collective punishment by Israel [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2706.4199999999996s)]
*  of Palestinian civilians is also a war crime and that the unlawful forcible evacuation of [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2711.14s)]
*  civilians is as well. Does the U.S. agree with the UN assessment? [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2716.8199999999997s)]
*  I spoke about this earlier this week in the – when it relates to questions about any of [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2722.3399999999997s)]
*  these kinds of legal determinations. We have a rigorous process in place for evaluating these [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2728.42s)]
*  kinds of things and have not made that assessment in this case, but this is a situation we're [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2734.26s)]
*  going to continue to pay attention to and remain in close partnership with Israel. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2740.42s)]
*  So it's an ongoing evaluation as things develop day by day? [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2745.14s)]
*  I spoke to this earlier in the week. Again, this is – we have a rigorous process in place, [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2748.26s)]
*  and it's not an assessment that we have made thus far. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2754.1800000000003s)]
*  Second, just quickly, do you believe – I mean, this is the UN saying it, [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2757.7s)]
*  which is seen as a objective side by lots of folks, including this administration. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2762.3399999999997s)]
*  Do you believe that the U.S. reputation, specifically among [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2769.22s)]
*  traditional Arab partners and allies, has taken a hit because of – what the UN is saying are [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2774.1s)]
*  war crimes, and you said this earlier, that you guys uphold human rights and preach about human [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2780.66s)]
*  rights across the world, and many folks are saying, including the UN, that there are human [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2785.86s)]
*  rights violations being committed by the Israelis? Let me just say that the Secretary, as part of his [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2789.86s)]
*  travels twice in the past month, has engaged deeply with our partners in the Arab world [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2796.58s)]
*  about steps that can be taken to address the current ongoing situation in Gaza, first and [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2805.94s)]
*  foremost, steps that we can all collectively take to further hold Hamas accountable for those [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2811.94s)]
*  terrorist attacks on October 7th, steps that we all can collectively take to ensure the flow of [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2817.62s)]
*  humanitarian aid. And you've seen partner countries take actions and steps of their own [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2823.14s)]
*  when it comes to the provision of humanitarian aid, and we, of course, welcome that. And that's [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2828.98s)]
*  something we're going to continue to work on as well. Go ahead. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2832.66s)]
*  Thank you, sir. Secretary Blinken is in India, and India-Canada tensions are escalating, [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2835.94s)]
*  especially after the expulsion of more than 40 Canadian diplomats. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2841.3s)]
*  Is the U.S. still trying to mediate or asking India to cooperate with the Canadian investigation [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2846.5800000000004s)]
*  of the murder of Khalid Saeed, the Hadees-e-Najjar? This is something that we're, of course, [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2851.0600000000004s)]
*  continuing to engage on with our partners in India as well as our partners in Canada as well. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2855.5400000000004s)]
*  Sir, one more question, if you'll allow me. Don't you think by ignoring Israeli brutalities [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2861.54s)]
*  in Gaza, United States is sending a wrong message to the powerful militaries and powerful [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2868.18s)]
*  countries around the world that they can do anything by killing thousands of innocent people, [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2874.2599999999998s)]
*  including children, on the name of self-defense? If tomorrow any other powerful country or powerful [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2881.06s)]
*  military do the same thing, what will be your position then? [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2885.7s)]
*  From podiums across this government, you have not seen us parse our words about the moral and [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2889.54s)]
*  strategic imperative to minimize and take steps to ensure that civilian casualties [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2897.3s)]
*  aren't taking place over the course of this conflict. And that's something that we're going [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2903.86s)]
*  to continue to raise directly with our Israeli partners. You've seen us do so. We've laid out [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2906.98s)]
*  steps that could potentially be taken to minimize this. We welcome the news today on [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2914.66s)]
*  this humanitarian pause, and we'll continue to work at this. Last question, Simon. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2920.66s)]
*  I wanted to come back to this phrase that you talked about, the rigorous process that's in place to [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2925.54s)]
*  assess in different situations, crimes against humanity, genocide, those kind of things. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2930.74s)]
*  To just clarify, it sounded like there is a rigorous process in place to make those [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2937.46s)]
*  determinations, but you haven't initiated a process in this case. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2943.78s)]
*  That is correct. I think a colleague from your exact newsroom asked the same question a couple [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2948.5800000000004s)]
*  days ago. I think it's a very important question, so we can't really go into it. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2953.86s)]
*  No, I'm not at all parsing the importance of the question. I just think I've spoken to it a couple [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2954.98s)]
*  times this week. So what – I'm not going to get into the specifics of those rigorous process. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2959.7000000000003s)]
*  These are internal deliberative processes that is as par for the course when we talk about [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2964.9s)]
*  the ways in which we go about this. But there is a rigorous process in place, and we have not [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2970.2599999999998s)]
*  come to that conclusion in this specific case. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2975.22s)]
*  Who – whose decision is it to initiate that rigorous process? [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2977.46s)]
*  It is a process across the interagency, is my understanding, but I'm happy to see if we have [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2981.54s)]
*  any specifics we can share. Is it – can you say sort of – it would be [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2987.06s)]
*  something initiated by the Secretary of State to say we're going to look into the case? [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2993.14s)]
*  Again, I don't want to misspeak the specifics of the parameters of how they work, [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=2997.7s)]
*  so I'm happy to check back and get back to you at a broad sense. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=3001.8599999999997s)]
*  You were asked about it a couple of days ago, so I thought you might have had a chance to – [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=3004.9s)]
*  Again, I'm happy to check the specifics for you. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=3007.7s)]
*  Sure. Thank you. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=3010.18s)]
*  All right. Thanks, everybody. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zGdg1clRY&t=3010.74s)]
