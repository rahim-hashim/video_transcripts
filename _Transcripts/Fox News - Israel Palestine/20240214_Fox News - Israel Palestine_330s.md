# IDF releases eerie footage of Hamas leader traveling through Gaza
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [February 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko)
*  Dana, I want you to look at this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=0.0s)]
*  This is what the IDF put out the other day from Sunday, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=1.28s)]
*  that hostage rescue in southern Gaza. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=3.24s)]
*  Jimmy, come on over here and I'll show you. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=6.08s)]
*  You can barely see that because it happened [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  in the middle of the night, all right? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=9.52s)]
*  These are the two men who are now free, all right, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=10.84s)]
*  with their wives. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=13.16s)]
*  But at two o'clock in the morning, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=14.92s)]
*  the IDF had a tip on this house in southern Gaza, right? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=16.48s)]
*  Okay, the hostages are here. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=20.96s)]
*  They had moths guards that were taken out. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=22.88s)]
*  IDF blows the door out, they make their move, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=25.72s)]
*  and they then extract them from Ra'a, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=28.439999999999998s)]
*  which right now has upwards of a million people in it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=31.2s)]
*  And the Israelis have a big decision to make [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=35.12s)]
*  as to how they execute this war right now [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=37.5s)]
*  through this southern town right on the border to Egypt. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=40.839999999999996s)]
*  They were evacuated to the medical center in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=43.26s)]
*  This man is age 60, he is age 70, and they are now home. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=45.8s)]
*  Wow, and now we have this video from the IDF. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=49.92s)]
*  And this is something else, okay? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=52.56s)]
*  This is in a tunnel somewhere in Gaza. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=53.72s)]
*  Maybe it's in the Ra'a area. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=55.84s)]
*  That man in red is Yaha Sinwar. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=57.16s)]
*  He's age 61, he is the leader of Hamas. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=59.559999999999995s)]
*  He's believed to be the mastermind of the attack [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=62.919999999999995s)]
*  on October 7th. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  General Jack Keene's with me now. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=66.75999999999999s)]
*  General, good morning to you. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=68.0s)]
*  My sense is they're close. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=70.08s)]
*  I don't know if it's a day from now, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=71.84s)]
*  maybe it's a month from now when they finally get Sinwar. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=73.32s)]
*  But when they do, that would be the equivalent [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=76.19999999999999s)]
*  for the Israelis for the Americans getting Osama bin Laden. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=78.36s)]
*  General, how close are they? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=82.24s)]
*  Well, we don't know. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=83.94s)]
*  And that's just the reality of it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=85.46s)]
*  Obviously, they had very good intelligence [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=87.02s)]
*  to be able to rescue our hostages [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=89.25999999999999s)]
*  in that very daring raid that you've been able [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=91.46s)]
*  to visualize for our viewers. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=94.46s)]
*  But Sinwar, look at that video you just showed. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=96.53999999999999s)]
*  I mean, appreciate the sinister and diabolical nature of this. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=99.97999999999999s)]
*  There's Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=104.42s)]
*  with his wife and family being protected [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=107.42s)]
*  by this tunnel compacts. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=109.94s)]
*  When he exposes all of the Hamas's women and children [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=111.66000000000001s)]
*  to the war that's taking place above those tunnels. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=115.66000000000001s)]
*  There are no bomb shelters. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=118.98s)]
*  There are no tunnels for the citizens of Gaza. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=120.46000000000001s)]
*  And he wants that exposure because he knows [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=123.74000000000001s)]
*  he'll get international condemnation of Israel [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=126.66000000000001s)]
*  as a result of the people being caught up in a war. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=129.98000000000002s)]
*  That is how cynical and diabolical this man is. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=133.54000000000002s)]
*  And hopefully the Israelis get to him soonest. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=136.9s)]
*  I guess it's a question of time. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=139.45999999999998s)]
*  I don't think he's going to get across that border into Egypt, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=141.38s)]
*  but we'll see whether or not that is the outcome. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=144.1s)]
*  Meanwhile, you've got the meeting at the White House [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=147.1s)]
*  yesterday with the leader from Jordan. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=149.22s)]
*  And apparently, Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=151.57999999999998s)]
*  was given yet another warning by Joe Biden [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=153.45999999999998s)]
*  as to that too many civilians are being killed in Gaza. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=155.45999999999998s)]
*  And here is John Kirby being asked about that [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=160.17999999999998s)]
*  yesterday at the White House. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=162.17999999999998s)]
*  We're going to keep working with our Israeli counterparts [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=163.98s)]
*  to do everything we can to protect our country. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=166.06s)]
*  We're going to keep working with our Israeli counterparts [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=168.62s)]
*  to do everything we can to get them to reduce [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=170.66000000000003s)]
*  the number of civilian casualties. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=172.74s)]
*  And they have been receptive. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=174.26000000000002s)]
*  I understand that there are still civilian casualties, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=175.70000000000002s)]
*  and that's unacceptable. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=178.70000000000002s)]
*  But they have been receptive to our messaging. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=180.14000000000001s)]
*  They have been receptive to our ideas [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=182.5s)]
*  and our perspectives in the past. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=184.02s)]
*  Yeah, how do you see that, General? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=185.42000000000002s)]
*  Well, I think the tension between the White House [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=189.06s)]
*  and certainly Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=191.3s)]
*  has been increasing over this issue, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=194.22000000000003s)]
*  I mean, obviously the catalyst was the visit [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=197.38s)]
*  from the Jordanian king. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=200.22s)]
*  But the reality here is that the Israelis, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=202.02s)]
*  when they went into northern Gaza, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=205.94s)]
*  they told the people to evacuate on a route [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=207.3s)]
*  that they identified for them, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=209.62s)]
*  to get as many of them out of the way as possible. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=211.06s)]
*  When they went into the southern part of Gaza, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=213.46s)]
*  particularly Yonkunis, where they still are, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=216.06s)]
*  they designated areas on a map for them to move to. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=220.14000000000001s)]
*  Obviously identifying to Hamas [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=224.38s)]
*  where the next fight was gonna take place. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=226.62s)]
*  And now they've got a huge problem. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=229.14000000000001s)]
*  And you're absolutely right, Bill. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=231.62s)]
*  I mean, we have a community of Rafa, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=232.9s)]
*  which normally is several hundred thousand. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=235.46s)]
*  There's over a million people there now [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=237.9s)]
*  seeking shelter in tents, homemade places to live. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=240.34s)]
*  There's huge humanitarian crisis. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=246.38s)]
*  If there was no war, there'd be a major crisis there [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=248.34s)]
*  because of food, water, and hygiene. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=250.46s)]
*  What the Israelis are trying to do [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=253.38s)]
*  is work a deal with the Egyptians to put up tents [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=254.66s)]
*  in the southwestern part of the Rafa area in Gaza, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=257.34s)]
*  along the coast, to get many of these people out of here. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=261.78s)]
*  But we are facing a very consequential part of the war. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=264.86s)]
*  The civilians are obviously a major issue here. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=269.42s)]
*  But also, the fact is about a third of Hamas fighters [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=272.74s)]
*  are still alive. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=277.06s)]
*  Most of Hamas' principle leaders, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=278.7s)]
*  as you've identified here, Sinwar, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=280.78s)]
*  are still alive. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=283.98s)]
*  And there's still a hundred plus hostages [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=284.82s)]
*  that are yet to be released, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=286.98s)]
*  despite the daring rescue that just took place [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=288.22s)]
*  in the last several days. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=291.1s)]
*  So much of the challenge that Israel is facing, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=292.5s)]
*  frankly, is still in front of them. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=295.74s)]
*  And this is gonna take some deliberate moves on their part. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=298.14s)]
*  I apologize for interrupting you there. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=302.22s)]
*  Consequential indeed, these negotiations could result [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=303.62s)]
*  in tent cities holding 25,000 people each [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=306.9s)]
*  all over the southern area of Gaza. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=310.7s)]
*  We'll see whether or not they get an agreement like that [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=312.58000000000004s)]
*  and what it looks like. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=314.5s)]
*  General, thank you, more to come. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=315.90000000000003s)]
*  Jack Keene, thanks for coming on today. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTmbMHZiko&t=317.22s)]
