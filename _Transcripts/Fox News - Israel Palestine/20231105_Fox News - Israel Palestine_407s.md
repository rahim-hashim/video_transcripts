# Retired Marine takes a closer look at Israel's ground offensive
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA)
*  back now with the Fox News alert Hezbollah threatening to attack Israel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=0.0s)]
*  after the idea took out a car full of suspected Hezbollah terrorists. The [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=5.12s)]
*  terrorist group claims innocent civilians died in the strike. I'm sure [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=9.540000000000001s)]
*  the New York Times gonna report that Alex Hogan is live in seven Israel with [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=13.64s)]
*  exactly what's happening on the ground right now. Alex, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  we're seeing significant strikes in Gaza. It is now day 31 of the war. You [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=23.5s)]
*  can probably hear some of the artillery behind me. U. S. Secretary of State [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=28.36s)]
*  Antony Blinken, continuing his trip around the Middle East, he met with the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=31.64s)]
*  prime minister of Iraq, pushing once again for that humanitarian pause. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=35.76s)]
*  This can be something that advances the prospect of getting the hostages back [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=41.36s)]
*  can also advance other things that were committed to doing. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=45.239999999999995s)]
*  Israeli forces have continued to push further into northern Gaza, now [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=51.36s)]
*  reaching all the way as far as the Mediterranean. See, so far they say [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=55.56s)]
*  they have targeted 2500 Hamas targets since the ground incursion began. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=59.84s)]
*  They're also encouraging anyone in northern Gaza, any civilian who might [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=65.16s)]
*  still be there to leave and head south, releasing as many as 1 million [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=69.36s)]
*  pamphlets across across northern Gaza and in the south in the southern part [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=74.2s)]
*  of Gaza. That is where we're hearing from the White House that as many as [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=80.18s)]
*  300 American citizens have been able to leave. We know, according to the State [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=83.44000000000001s)]
*  Department, that as many as 400 Americans who are in Gaza are hoping to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=87.76s)]
*  get out and new just in the last several hours, we're learning more about [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=92.44000000000001s)]
*  the growing tensions in the northern part of the country. That is where [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=96.44000000000001s)]
*  Hezbollah said it unleashed grad rockets. Those are again wide spraying [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=100.64000000000001s)]
*  rockets. There's no specific territory of exactly where they would land. So a [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=106.84s)]
*  very, very dangerous rocket to try to launch. But that was launched after [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=111.48s)]
*  Lebanese authorities say that an Israeli strike hit a car carrying three [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=115.84s)]
*  daughters and a grandmother. Back to you, Alex. Thanks so much. Great reporting. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=121.0s)]
*  Stay safe. Now let's go to Joey, who has a closer look at Israel's ground [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=126.2s)]
*  defense of Joey and the touch screen. Yeah, the infamous touch screen at this [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=131.84s)]
*  point. I've learned how to use it. Thankfully, I want to show you guys [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=136.24s)]
*  some. So this is the Gaza Strip in Israel. And as you see here, I just want [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=138.60000000000002s)]
*  to point out a few things. First, you can see these black lines coming down [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=142.24s)]
*  at a diagonal and they kind of create a line here across the center of Gaza. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=146.32000000000002s)]
*  This is your evacuation zone. This is where they're telling everyone to get [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  out of. And why is that? That's because Gaza City is right in the middle here. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=153.28s)]
*  So this is Gaza City. This gray area here are the more densely populated [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=156.72s)]
*  areas. And what I really want to hone in on here, guys, and show you is this [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=161.12s)]
*  about three to four mile parcel of land right here from the border coming in. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=165.08s)]
*  And this is a push that the Israeli forces that EF is doing what we call a [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=170.12s)]
*  slow methodical clear. The reason why this is so important, if you look here, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=174.8s)]
*  they're getting into the more densely populated area, but they're still clicks [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=178.84s)]
*  miles away from what is Gaza City. Now, another important part of this map, I [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=182.2s)]
*  want to show you this town here, Jabalia. And I want to give you some information [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=186.32s)]
*  before we get started here. So what we've learned is that Israel took an [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=190.64s)]
*  intelligence post, Hamas intelligence post in Jabalia and learned from that [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=194.28s)]
*  intelligence what they believe to be true is that as that Hamas has decided [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=198.64000000000001s)]
*  to retreat from the outskirts from the outer area of northern Gaza into the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=203.08s)]
*  city to mount their defensive. And I'll show you why that's so important as we [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=207.84s)]
*  go through these slides. Give me just a second here to go to the next slide. So [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=212.56s)]
*  as you saw that sliver of land in the northwest corner there, this is the this [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=215.84s)]
*  is a zoom in of the upper third of that piece of land there in the northwest [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=219.88s)]
*  corner of Gaza. And what you see here with all of these blue lines here, let [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=224.6s)]
*  me use red with all these blue lines coming down. This is troop and tank [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=228.92s)]
*  movement. Most of these blue lines are on roads and just take a look here, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=232.51999999999998s)]
*  guys. You see this is mostly farmland and what we can show you here. I'll do [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=236.68s)]
*  it in in blue with these circles. These air craters that air visible from [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=241.0s)]
*  satellite imaging of probably some sort of artillery. It would call it indirect [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=245.88s)]
*  fire. It's lobbed over and you can see these craters all over this first third [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=250.44s)]
*  here and then you see the movements of the tanks, Israeli troops going through [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=254.2s)]
*  mostly farmland, probably taking out where manned units were shooting rockets [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=257.68s)]
*  or mortars. As we keep going into the second third of this strip, now you [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=262.32s)]
*  start to see a couple of other things that are really important. I'll use two [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=266.88s)]
*  different colors here. So first I want to use red to show you where some of these [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=269.56s)]
*  craters are. There's a big part of a town here that's absolutely decimated. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=273.88s)]
*  And then in blue, I want to show you what's really important. These are [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=278.64s)]
*  military vehicles. So this is how far they've made it. So they've made it on [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=281.08s)]
*  into and as you can see, it's starting to get much more rule. And I want to go [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=285.32s)]
*  on to the next one here because here's where you see they're getting into [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=288.79999999999995s)]
*  really dense populated areas. And in this in this you can see I'll use red [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=292.64s)]
*  again. This is craters where there used to be houses, craters where there used [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=297.28s)]
*  to be houses. And so what you're seeing here is they're getting closer to the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=301.56s)]
*  densely populated area, which essentially means they're getting closer to where [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=304.92s)]
*  Hamas is going to mount their defensive. They're not trying to defend farmland. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=308.48s)]
*  They're trying to defend big municipality, big, big densely populated [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=312.48s)]
*  area because that's where they have a strategic advantage. All right. So Joey, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=317.68s)]
*  based on the experience that you had fighting in the Marine Corps, how do you [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=321.36s)]
*  fight terrorists who embed themselves in these densely populated civilian [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=326.12s)]
*  areas? How do you draw them out? Yeah. So another part of intelligence that we've [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=331.24s)]
*  that we've seen reported is that Hamas is using I.D.s. And so I.D.s are great [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=335.64s)]
*  because they lay in wait. These are basically mines of different types. They [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=340.40000000000003s)]
*  can be up in a wall or they can be in the ground. You don't have to be there. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=343.68s)]
*  You set them up, you put a battery on them and then you can be miles away. As [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=346.8s)]
*  Israel is coming in, they're having to sweep the street, sweep these allies [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=350.54s)]
*  anywhere they're on foot, anywhere they have a vehicle, they're having to sweep [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  them slowly and methodically. And they've even put out images showing that's [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=356.56s)]
*  exactly what they're doing. That's what makes it take days and weeks instead of [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=359.48s)]
*  hours to go a mile. And so the I.D. component, the land mines, the different [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=363.24s)]
*  types of lay in wait munitions that they have some supplied by other countries [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=367.92s)]
*  as actual conventional ordinance, others homemade but very sophisticatedly made [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=372.0s)]
*  I.D.s. That's your biggest threat. Once you get into the actual urban [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=376.88s)]
*  environment where you have three D structures, now you've got snipers, now [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=380.68s)]
*  you've got rocket positions, you've got more direct fire, but direct fire that [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=384.48s)]
*  can take out a tank, RPGs, things like that. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=388.0s)]
*  All right, Joey. Great work. Can't wait to have you back here at the desk. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B53hL6AvcA&t=391.04s)]
