# Kayleigh McEnany: This is only getting worse for Biden
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ)
*  We have a Fox News alert. New York City Mayor Eric Adams speaking right now at City Hall. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=0.0s)]
*  You see him there. He addressed the anti-Israel protesters moments ago. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Our college campuses cannot be used to accord for the extermination of any group. Some of [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=11.76s)]
*  the terminologies that were used were just really harmful and despicable. That's not [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=18.32s)]
*  who we are as a country. So the police department is going to brief me later. We're going to [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=22.32s)]
*  communicate with Columbia and make the determination on what the next steps are that we're going [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=27.72s)]
*  to institute. So he's meeting with police to determine what's next. We know the president [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=32.839999999999996s)]
*  of Columbia certainly needs some help. Well, onto this. President Biden's young voter problem [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=38.68s)]
*  is only getting worse. The president facing major backlash from young voters over his [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=43.8s)]
*  handling of the Israel Hamas war and the anti-Israel movement is posing a major threat to his reelection [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=48.44s)]
*  campaign. The protesters have even come up with a nickname for him, Genocide Joe, they call him. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=54.8s)]
*  The outrage over Biden's response to the Middle East crisis is straining his support from young [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=61.919999999999995s)]
*  voters, a key voting group for Democrats. Jesse, they need young people. Young people are unpredictable. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=66.32s)]
*  Trump's winning them by 11 in the CNN poll. Yeah, those are big numbers and props to Mayor Eric [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=73.2s)]
*  Adams, who just big footed the Columbia president and he said, we're not going to tolerate little [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=77.6s)]
*  terror cells calling for the extermination of religious minority in this city. I run the city. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=83.28s)]
*  Columbia University does not run the city. We can't tolerate that. So good for him. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=89.6s)]
*  Yeah, the young voters are now moving into Trump's direction. A little of this is because of the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=94.4s)]
*  Hamas stuff, but a lot of it's economics. You speak to people, they can't buy homes. They can't [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=98.48s)]
*  start families. They can't afford groceries. How are you going to start the American dream with rates [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=103.92s)]
*  at seven and a half percent? You can't. You can't even have a girlfriend if you're living with your [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=108.88s)]
*  parents. I have no. Well, there's ways around that, but it's just it's not a nice runway to start your [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=113.75999999999999s)]
*  life and live the dream. Kennedy and the White House is pushing reporters to a Harvard youth poll, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=120.08s)]
*  which shows to Jesse's point, Gaza is only at two percent of importance to young voters. But oh wait, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=126.64s)]
*  economy is at the top. So I'm not sure that's a selling point for Biden. And guess what else [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=131.2s)]
*  is immigration? Because they are some of the new generation of workers who are having to compete [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=134.88s)]
*  with jobs for people who are being employed in the black market, they're working for cash, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  and they're taking away some of the entry level jobs that, you know, kids who are either in college [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=146.64s)]
*  or looking to go or trying to get, they can't get them. They can't even start the process for [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=152.16s)]
*  economic mobility. That's why in a bad economy, and you can tell me it's great if you can't afford [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  things, it's not for you. It's always going to be at the top. They're going to try and shoehorn [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=162.48s)]
*  abortion back to the top of the menu somehow with political maneuvering. That's the only [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=167.84s)]
*  shot they've got. Well, and because of all of that, I'm just really confused why Biden would offer to [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=172.72s)]
*  repeal the Trump tax breaks, because we did a breakout on what those numbers would look like [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=179.04s)]
*  for a family. And some people, it's been argued, don't even know they're getting the tax breaks, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  and they're going to owe like $2,500 if they have two children, more. $2,500 may not sound like a lot [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=189.36s)]
*  of money to some people, but it is. And so I don't know who he thinks his audience is, but he's not [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=194.88000000000002s)]
*  speaking to middle and low income families right now by repealing the tax breaks of Donald Trump. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=201.20000000000002s)]
*  It's like he's forgotten his math if he ever knew it. Emily. Right. The bottom line is we know he's [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=206.96s)]
*  been attempting to purchase votes this entire time in every respective category. We know this, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=212.4s)]
*  especially in this department, because his administration acknowledged that the economy [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=216.72s)]
*  was the number one woe for young voters. And then they proceeded to say, and that is why we are [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=221.6s)]
*  forgiving student debt to alleviate the financial burden. Instead of saying we will change our [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=226.32s)]
*  policies, we will help alleviate the stifling and suffocating regulations and the tax, you know, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=232.96s)]
*  levying that they have on everyone. The oppressive suffocating environment right now has all been [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=239.52s)]
*  created by this president. So telling some group of people that they're going to forgive a cost [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=244.8s)]
*  that is then going to be absorbed by another part of the population makes no economic sense. But [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=251.04000000000002s)]
*  here the president will just continue attempting to buy votes. Yes, those loans should be pulled [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=256.0s)]
*  if you have engaged in anti-Semitism. We still await a White House answer on that, by the way. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbdCQVw2IDQ&t=261.84000000000003s)]
