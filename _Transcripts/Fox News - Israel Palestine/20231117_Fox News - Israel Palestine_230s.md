# IDF spokesperson: Israel taking ‘several concrete steps’ to minimize civilian casualties
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l90nAHjI1c)
*  Let's go live now to Tel Aviv, Major Libby Weiss, spokesperson for the Israeli Defense Forces. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l90nAHjI1c&t=0.0s)]
*  Major, thanks for being here. First, if you could, give us an update of where things are [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l90nAHjI1c&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  logistically and from an IDF perspective tonight. Well, thank you for having me. The IDF is [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l90nAHjI1c&t=11.92s)]
*  continuing to dismantle Hamas and Hamas infrastructure in the northern part of the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l90nAHjI1c&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  Gaza Strip. At this stage, we have destroyed hundreds of tunnels and are continuing really [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l90nAHjI1c&t=26.639999999999997s)]
*  to hunt Hamas wherever they are in the northern part of the Strip and to act very precisely [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l90nAHjI1c&t=33.36s)]
*  within the Shifa Hospital, where we continue to uncover Hamas infrastructure and weapons [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l90nAHjI1c&t=40.32s)]
*  and really things that have no business being in a hospital in the first place. But we're continuing [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l90nAHjI1c&t=46.4s)]
*  to do that with the focus on making sure Hamas can never strike us again. You hear all of the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l90nAHjI1c&t=51.6s)]
*  protests, you hear all of the pushback about a humanitarian crisis. Clearly, they're feeling that [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l90nAHjI1c&t=58.72s)]
*  inside Gaza. You are trying, and I talked to the Israeli Prime Minister about having efforts to [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l90nAHjI1c&t=63.92s)]
*  get civilians out of the way, trying hard to avoid civilian casualties and also help them [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l90nAHjI1c&t=70.32s)]
*  in some of the dire needs that they have. Explain some of that and what's exactly happening. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l90nAHjI1c&t=77.44s)]
*  Absolutely. So we have taken several concrete steps in the last month to minimize the impact [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l90nAHjI1c&t=84.32s)]
*  on civilians in the Gaza Strip. They are absolutely not our target. We are only striking Hamas. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l90nAHjI1c&t=90.8s)]
*  And those measures have included first and foremost telling them to move from the northern [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l90nAHjI1c&t=97.44s)]
*  part of the Strip to the southern part of the Strip. And at this stage, more than 900,000 [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l90nAHjI1c&t=102.48s)]
*  civilians have moved and more continue to move every single day. We've dropped more than a million [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l90nAHjI1c&t=107.60000000000001s)]
*  and a half flyers, made more than five million phone calls and text messages encouraging people [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l90nAHjI1c&t=114.16s)]
*  to move. And we do this out of a legal obligation. And because we don't want to harm or hurt civilians, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l90nAHjI1c&t=119.84s)]
*  despite the fact that this gives Hamas to a degree some sort of operational advantage, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l90nAHjI1c&t=128.32s)]
*  but we're doing that nonetheless. On a daily basis, we have civilians moving in an evacuation [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l90nAHjI1c&t=133.20000000000002s)]
*  corridor that the IDF is securing because we have seen in the past that Hamas has actually [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l90nAHjI1c&t=139.52s)]
*  struck its own civilians who've attempted to move from the northern part of the Strip to the south. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l90nAHjI1c&t=145.68s)]
*  So we are securing them in that movement. And we're continuing the supply of humanitarian [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l90nAHjI1c&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  goods into the Strip. So really, we are the only party in this conflict that has any regard for the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l90nAHjI1c&t=157.12s)]
*  welfare of civilians on either side. Major, I only have a few seconds here, but obviously Hamas, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l90nAHjI1c&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  and we've talked about this, tries to keep people in certain areas. They do use human shields. But [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l90nAHjI1c&t=169.76s)]
*  in the same breath, there have been thousands of Palestinians killed inside of Gaza. Do you have [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l90nAHjI1c&t=175.76s)]
*  a number on that, what that number is? I don't have a number to share at this point. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l90nAHjI1c&t=182.72s)]
*  I can say, though, that the loss of any civilian life is tragic, and it's not something that we [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l90nAHjI1c&t=190.0s)]
*  want. And we take several measures to minimize that. And that's something that we carry with us [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l90nAHjI1c&t=195.92s)]
*  as we fight a horrific terror organization that intentionally targets both civilians here and [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l90nAHjI1c&t=202.88s)]
*  civilians in the Gaza Strip. Major, we appreciate the time. Thanks for the update. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l90nAHjI1c&t=208.64s)]
