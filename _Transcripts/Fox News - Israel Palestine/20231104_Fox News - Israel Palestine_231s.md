# ‘SHADOWBANNED’: Activist reveals why TikTok ‘heavily censored’ her pro-Israel content
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc)
*  Anti-Israel sentiment and support for Palestine is more common amongst young Americans, almost [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=0.0s)]
*  50-50, and is social media to blame. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=7.48s)]
*  There are now over 3.6 billion views for pro-Palestinian posts on TikTok. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=11.84s)]
*  That alone, compared to 255 million views for pro-Israel posts. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=18.8s)]
*  It's not even close. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=24.72s)]
*  Here to weigh in is journalist and Israeli activist Emily Austin. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  Emily, thanks for being here. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=29.84s)]
*  China can turn that pipeline on any way it wants. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=32.16s)]
*  Break down what's happening on TikTok right now. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=36.04s)]
*  So I can attest that as a pro-Israel voice, my views are so heavily censored. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=38.8s)]
*  I've been shadowbanned my last who knows how many posts. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=43.56s)]
*  And the only reason they ever get views at all is if I physically click send to all my [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=46.8s)]
*  friends or I'm like, hey, go promote this, go share it, because I'm not getting the views [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=50.72s)]
*  on TikTok. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=54.34s)]
*  On the other hand, when I go on my for you page, it's all of these like propaganda pro-Palestine [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=55.760000000000005s)]
*  TikToks with really sad songs in the background making it seem like Gaza is this open air [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=60.36s)]
*  prison and these like Gen Z students or kids on it really don't know the difference. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=65.68s)]
*  They're not going to go off of TikTok to do their research. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=70.48s)]
*  So they're being brainwashed by all the propaganda videos and you don't see any of the other [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=73.18s)]
*  side on it. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=77.02000000000001s)]
*  You only see pro-Palestine. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=78.02000000000001s)]
*  And you're saying it's really effective. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=79.02000000000001s)]
*  I mean, if you're a young person who hasn't studied history and don't understand the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=80.72s)]
*  dynamics, it's one sided. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=84.12s)]
*  I mean, you see the effects of TikTok in general. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=87.04s)]
*  If TikTok says go eat Tide Pods, now you have kids literally dying from eating Tide Pods. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=89.12s)]
*  The effect of TikTok on kids is something unseen. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=93.84s)]
*  And yes, it's compelling because they start these trends and now the pro-Palestinians [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  are hopping on these same trends, except they're making it all of this propaganda that is brainwashing [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=101.8s)]
*  now the kids. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=107.3s)]
*  Well, it's working. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=108.3s)]
*  There's a poll that asked young people, do you approve or disapprove of the way Israel [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=109.76s)]
*  is responding to the Hamas terrorist attacks? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=113.68s)]
*  Majority disapprove. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=118.08000000000001s)]
*  I mean, this is a terrorist attack that killed 1,400 innocent Israelis. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=119.08000000000001s)]
*  Israel is responding and young people say no? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=125.36s)]
*  Well, most people don't, most kids don't even know that Hamas is a terrorist organization. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=128.08s)]
*  When you say Hamas, they think it's the governing body of Palestine. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=133.28s)]
*  They don't understand that if you really want to free Palestine, you should want Hamas [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=137.2s)]
*  out of the government too, because they are pressing their own, not just the Jewish people. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=140.35999999999999s)]
*  It's especially the Jewish people, but they're really just attacking everyone. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=144.2s)]
*  If you really care about Palestine, you'll want Hamas out of their government too. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=147.6s)]
*  So between the education that kids are getting, K-12, which we know is captured or into the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=151.23999999999998s)]
*  university, and TikTok, where they're getting a one-sided view, how do we get out? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=156.83999999999997s)]
*  What's the future look like? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=163.07999999999998s)]
*  The criminal institutions have failed us. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=165.07999999999998s)]
*  That's already established. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=166.72s)]
*  The future is we need to do something to get these pro-Israel voices uncensored. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=168.24s)]
*  We need to have a balance on social media and unfortunately it's not the case. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=173.64s)]
*  But China controls it. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=176.35999999999999s)]
*  I mean, TikTok, I'm not on it because I don't want to give anything to... [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  I know young people are. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=180.72s)]
*  I mean, they, our enemy decides what our young people see. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=181.84s)]
*  That's what America has to step in. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=187.72s)]
*  Because you're right, China, Russia, all the dictators all align. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=188.92s)]
*  It's their best interest if we decline as a society and it's working. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=193.6s)]
*  So that's up to our government to start to restrict things like that. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=197.2s)]
*  They're not going to stop it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=200.8s)]
*  It helps them. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=201.8s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=203.16s)]
*  I mean, imagine if our greatest enemy was able to put together an app where they got [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=204.16s)]
*  to tell U.S. kids to hate their country. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=208.92000000000002s)]
*  We don't have to imagine. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=211.0s)]
*  We have it right now. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=212.0s)]
*  It's called TikTok. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=213.0s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=214.0s)]
*  We'll keep up the fight. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=215.0s)]
*  Emily, thank you. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=216.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=217.0s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=218.0s)]
*  All right, more Fox and Friends just moments away. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOskPFtcsZc&t=219.0s)]
