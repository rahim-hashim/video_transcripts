# 'AXIS OF DARKNESS': Netanyahu tells Hannity antisemitism echoes Nazi atrocities
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs)
*  And welcome back to Hannity. Here is part two of my interview with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=0.0s)]
*  You didn't, Israel did not start this war. You did not want this war, but you must win the war. I would argue that. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=7.36s)]
*  Let me ask you about [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=13.92s)]
*  what has been going on worldwide, and that is virulent anti-Semitism that I never thought, Mr Prime Minister, I'd see in my lifetime. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=15.84s)]
*  You know, hearing over and over again [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=23.36s)]
*  in New York and in London, you know, from the river to the sea, which means to wipe Israel off the map or the call for [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=25.68s)]
*  Antifada. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  The things I'm hearing in the halls of Congress in my country or college campuses in my country or what we're hearing in [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=34.08s)]
*  Europe or what, you know, I never thought Australia would ever hear [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  chanting, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=45.019999999999996s)]
*  gas the Jews, F the Jews. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=46.56s)]
*  With all of that, how do you, it's inexplicable to me. Can you explain it and can you explain [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=49.6s)]
*  why the pressure is coming from even my own government, our government here in the U.S., Joe Biden, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=56.88s)]
*  to put a pause as you now try to, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=62.8s)]
*  you know, you are in a battle for your survival. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=65.84s)]
*  You know, never again, as you said, is now, never again is right now. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  Well, I think the American government and President Biden have been very supportive of Israel. There was a question of humanitarian. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=73.28s)]
*  I think they were very clear. We can't have a ceasefire. We have a ceasefire. It means that it's a surrender to Hamas. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=80.39999999999999s)]
*  It's a surrender to terrorism. It's a victory for the axis of terror. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=87.19999999999999s)]
*  That doesn't mean that we can't give, you know, in a specific time, in a specific place for a safe corridor for [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=90.8s)]
*  Palestinian civilians to leave the zone of fighting. Yeah, we do give them the ability to do that. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=97.44s)]
*  But I don't think anyone argues for a general ceasefire. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=102.08s)]
*  That's not going to happen. By the way, the only time we'll have a ceasefire is for the return of our hostages. Without that, it's not going to happen. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=105.2s)]
*  And then we'll continue until the battle is won. But I have to tell you that you talk about anti-Semitism. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=111.68s)]
*  I think that it's the oldest hatred. You know, it's an old disease and it morphs. It takes on new forms every time. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=118.72s)]
*  And what the anti-Semites don't realize is the attacks start with the Jews, on the Jews, but they never end there. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=125.36s)]
*  That's what happened in the Holocaust. People said, oh, well, you know, the attacks of the Nazis on the Jews before World War II or even the beginning. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=133.44s)]
*  That's okay. No, it wasn't because it afflicted all of humanity, all of civilization. And that's what you have here, too. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=141.36s)]
*  The reason they're attacking Israel is this axis of terror understands that we're the forward position of the West and of civilization. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=148.88s)]
*  And we're just a stumbling block on the way to you. So these people who are demonstrating in the United States and the West, I don't think they represent the majority of the American people. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=158.48s)]
*  I know they don't. But there's a minority there that is completely misguided and even worse than that. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  And I think that they don't give Israel the right that they would afford to any of their countries. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=177.04s)]
*  Imagine the United States is it with twenty nine elevens. Sean, that's what we had. Proportionately, we had twenty nine elevens. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=181.84s)]
*  Imagine fifty thousand Americans killed in one day. Imagine ten thousand Americans are taken hostage in one day. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=190.88s)]
*  Imagine this brutality, this savagery in one day and think about what would America do? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=199.12s)]
*  Well, it would do exactly what we're doing. It would go against the terrorists. It would fight them in the streets. It would fight them everywhere they meet. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=205.6s)]
*  And that's what you did against Al Qaeda after nine eleven. That's what you did against ISIS. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=213.84s)]
*  You didn't relent. You didn't say, well, because they're hiding in civilian areas in Mosul or in Fallujah, we can't fight them. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=219.12s)]
*  You sent your brave soldiers there and they did exactly what we're doing. And we're doing it in the best way that we can. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=226.4s)]
*  But we have to win this fight. And those who don't understand it, you know, that's that's a it's an indictment. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=232.4s)]
*  You know, it's an indictment of of of these people that they are basically aligning themselves with evil against good. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=238.32s)]
*  Evil cannot win. And we're not going to be impressed by these demonstrations. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=246.4s)]
*  We're going to do what's right and win this war for our sake, for the sake of humanity and civilization. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=249.76s)]
*  If you extrapolate out Israel's population of a little over nine million and the U.S.'s population, you are right. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=255.6s)]
*  You're talking about in a single day, over 40,000 Americans lost in a single day. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=263.12s)]
*  If we extrapolate out the population on nine eleven, we lost two thousand nine hundred and seventy seven Americans. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=268.8s)]
*  I know you can't comment on it. I want to just clarify. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=275.68s)]
*  You are open to some potential deal for the release of the hostages. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=279.04s)]
*  I know there's been talk that maybe former Prime Minister Tony Blair could be part of that negotiations. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=286.32s)]
*  And, you know, there's a lot of pressure being brought to Israel. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=292.88s)]
*  It's not Israel. Israel has gone to great lengths by dropping leaflets and sending text messages, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=298.0s)]
*  telling innocent people to get out. And here's where the safe zone is. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=304.24s)]
*  So you're almost giving away your own intelligence and your own strategies in doing so. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=308.16s)]
*  But you have done that. But yet it's Hamas that has been using for a long time now, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=315.28000000000003s)]
*  innocent civilians as human shields. And they do it now. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=322.48s)]
*  And they build their terror tunnels. My understanding is you have found them under hospitals? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=326.16s)]
*  You know, under hospitals, command posts in hospitals, terror tunnels under hospitals, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=330.96000000000004s)]
*  everywhere you see. So, you know, I said, OK, let's build alternative hospitals. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=336.64s)]
*  Let's build field hospitals. I've asked country. I've asked France to send in [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=340.96s)]
*  a floating hospital ship. They're doing that. I've asked Arab countries and others to build [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=345.28s)]
*  field hospitals so we can get all these people out. We have a humanitarian safe zone in the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=351.36s)]
*  south, the southern part of the Gaza Strip. We're putting in trucks, humanitarian, you know, drugs, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=356.4s)]
*  medicine, rather, food, water. That's what's required under humanitarian international law. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=363.84s)]
*  We're doing all that. And guess who's interfering with that? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=368.64s)]
*  Guess who's firing on the Palestinians who want to leave the safe zone? Hamas. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=371.76s)]
*  So the fact that people are condemning Israel is absurd. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=376.4s)]
*  You know, I'll give you the example. The best example I can give you is the Nazis attack the [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=380.15999999999997s)]
*  West. You know, they conquer Europe, they conquer Poland, they invade France and so on. And America [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=385.03999999999996s)]
*  and its allies organize themselves to counterattack. They invade Normandy. They go [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=389.52s)]
*  through the cities of France. They go through the cities of Germany until they reach Berlin and [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=395.68s)]
*  reach the victory. And in the process, the German army is fighting them within cities. They're [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=399.84s)]
*  fighting them within civilian communities. So what do the allies do? They say, well, we can't do [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=405.03999999999996s)]
*  anything. Of course not. They try to minimize civilian casualties, although many, many, many [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=409.2s)]
*  Germans were killed, as you know. And they do the job. That's what we're trying to do. We're trying [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=414.56s)]
*  to minimize civilian casualties. But under no circumstances should we be blamed any more than [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=419.36s)]
*  the allies should be blamed. And those people who demonstrate against Israel are basically lining up [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=424.32s)]
*  with the forces of darkness. Chancellor Schultz of Germany was here and he said these people [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=431.6s)]
*  are not only worse than ISIS, which is what President Biden called them. He said they're [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=437.92s)]
*  the new Nazis. So these people are basically lining up with the Nazis against the allies. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=443.52000000000004s)]
*  And that's the battle we have here. The axis of terror, the axis of darkness against the allies, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=449.12s)]
*  the allies for peace, the allies for prosperity, the allies for normal life. And I ask, and the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=454.4s)]
*  majority of Americans understand this. They understand who are the forces of good and who [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=460.32s)]
*  are the forces of bad. They're lining up with Israel, most of the American people, clearly, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=464.48s)]
*  the American Congress, the American president and the American administration. And I'm telling you, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=469.12s)]
*  because they understand this is a battle, this is our common battle. Our battle is your battle. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=473.84s)]
*  Our fight is your fight. Our victory is your victory. And nothing can stand in the way of [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=479.35999999999996s)]
*  total victory any more than you could have partial victory against the Nazis. You had to win. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=485.52s)]
*  Partial victory against Al-Qaeda, you had to win. Partial victory against ISIS, you have to win. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=490.88s)]
*  Hamas, ISIS has to be defeated. These modern day monsters have to be defeated and we will defeat [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=496.08s)]
*  them. My last question, I want to, I know your time is very, very limited here, but you are open [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=503.44000000000005s)]
*  to a potential deal for the release of hostages, one. And number two, even though Joe Biden has [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=509.52000000000004s)]
*  said very publicly he's calling on you for a pause, that's, is that not happening? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=515.36s)]
*  Even though he said, he did say that himself last week. No, we came to, we came to a clear [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=522.0s)]
*  understanding. I think there's a clear difference between a general ceasefire, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=527.68s)]
*  which we would only do for the release of the hostages. And again, it would be a temporary one. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=532.3199999999999s)]
*  And after that, we'll continue the battle to its final culmination of victory. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=536.9599999999999s)]
*  And I distinguish that from local pauses or local humanitarian corridors that we make to enable [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=541.04s)]
*  people to leave the zone of battle. So we're doing that. We're actually, I think, have an [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=547.04s)]
*  understanding on that. But more importantly, I think the larger understanding is this, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=551.52s)]
*  this is not a minor battle between two tribes. This is not a minor battle between [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=556.9599999999999s)]
*  this point of view or that point of view. This is not what we're talking about. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=565.36s)]
*  This is a battle for the future of civilization. Because this kind of barbarism that many believed [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=569.12s)]
*  was a relic of the past has come full force in the 21st century. And we see that these darkest [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=576.48s)]
*  forces that take us back to the Middle Ages and maybe earlier periods are just as rampant. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=584.08s)]
*  And you know, history doesn't give us an automatic guarantee. It doesn't say that the good will win [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=589.76s)]
*  over the bad if the good doesn't muster its resolve and courage and is committed to winning. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=595.6800000000001s)]
*  And that's what we're committed to. And I expect that all Americans who hear us now, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9DONSKyQs&t=604.1600000000001s)]
