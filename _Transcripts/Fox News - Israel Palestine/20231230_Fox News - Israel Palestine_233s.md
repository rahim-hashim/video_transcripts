# Biden has opened a ‘spigot’ for the Iranians: David Asman
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8)
*  Iran proxy attacks on U.S. forces now up to 108. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=0.0s)]
*  As they keep escalating, we keep asking, what can we do to stop this? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=5.5s)]
*  Let's ask former USS Cole Commander Kirk Lippold. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=10.16s)]
*  Commander, thank you for being here. Happy New Year. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=13.66s)]
*  You know, there's an old saying in journalism, follow the money. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=15.700000000000001s)]
*  Well, it all seems to lead back to Iran, doesn't it? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=19.900000000000002s)]
*  Well, happy New Year, David. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=23.54s)]
*  And yes, it really does come down to the money. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=24.740000000000002s)]
*  And at the end of the day, what that means is the first thing that the U.S. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=27.1s)]
*  should consider is is you hear a lot of people talking that, geez, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=30.360000000000003s)]
*  we should go from these attacks on our forces directly to kinetic. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=34.9s)]
*  In other words, we should be attacking them. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=38.760000000000005s)]
*  The reality is we could go and start doing pre joint JCPOA or nuclear agreement. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=40.7s)]
*  We could put sanctions on Iran. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=48.3s)]
*  We could begin to inspect maritime. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=50.0s)]
*  There's a number of things that we could do. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=52.36s)]
*  But in actuality, you follow sanctions, you get to the money. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=54.14s)]
*  The money is what Iran needs to continue this war. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=57.74s)]
*  And we've proven that. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=60.5s)]
*  I mean, we had the maximum pressure campaign of the previous administration [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=62.34s)]
*  where we imposed these sanctions. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=65.7s)]
*  And for some reason, this administration thought it would do the world better [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=68.0s)]
*  if we took those sanctions off. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=71.68s)]
*  We don't have to put our troops at risk. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=73.4s)]
*  All we have to do is turn off the spigot that the Biden administration [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=76.18s)]
*  opened for the Iranians. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=80.64s)]
*  Well, and it's not just the Biden administration, David, it's also the Obama administration. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=82.68s)]
*  They are so desperate for that nuclear agreement, which at this point, let's be realistic. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=87.2s)]
*  It is dead. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=92.38s)]
*  The enrichment activities by the Iranians and the Ayatollahs have clearly proven that they are after a weapon. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=93.8s)]
*  They are going to continue to pursue it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=99.48s)]
*  It is going to be a destabilizer, not just for the Middle East, but the world. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=101.48s)]
*  So we need to take positive steps to do the snapback sanctions and then oppose others to [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=105.34s)]
*  literally begin to strangle Iran as quickly and effectively as possible. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=110.8s)]
*  Well, we also need to make sure that our allies around the world, both in the Far East and in Europe, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=115.24s)]
*  get on board with it because they need to understand that at this point, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=120.96s)]
*  the world is entering, and especially the United States, a period of strategic danger [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=124.56s)]
*  between Russia, China, and Iranian activities that are destabilizing the world. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=129.34s)]
*  Well, Commander, what do we do if Iran does get a nuke? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=134.06s)]
*  You know, I think that at that point, we're going to have to look and figure out what we need to do [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=138.8s)]
*  and can we destroy that capability. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=143.04s)]
*  I'm sure that right now, the Joint Chiefs of Staff are very diligently working trying to figure out, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=145.04s)]
*  can a strike be done? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=150.58s)]
*  But you have to remember, we may have a say in that, but at the end of the day, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=152.04s)]
*  the country that is threatened the most by those nuclear weapons is Israel. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=156.74s)]
*  And I would not be surprised if Israel gives Iran the opportunity, disarm, stand down, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=161.48000000000002s)]
*  or they would make Iran cease to exist. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=167.38s)]
*  Commander, you have some experience with attacks on U.S. ships yourself as Commander of the USS Cole. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=169.74s)]
*  Have they stopped now in the Red Sea because there is more commerce? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=174.98s)]
*  We don't have much time, but has the task force been successful? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=178.98s)]
*  The task force has not been successful, and while maritime traffic has picked up, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=183.38s)]
*  you can see a number of nations have chosen not to come under any kind of U.S. or coordinated control. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=187.48s)]
*  They're taking care of their ships first, so it's a very disjointed effort, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=193.28s)]
*  but at the end of the day, the Biden administration and Secretary Austin need to exercise leadership in that area [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=197.28s)]
*  to demonstrate that we can keep those shipping safe. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=203.58s)]
*  Well, thank you for exercising leadership as Commander of the USS Navy. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=206.18s)]
*  We really appreciate you coming in. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=210.48s)]
*  Commander Lippold, thank you for being here. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=211.98s)]
*  Happy New Year to you. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=213.68s)]
*  So thank you, David. Happy New Year. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkWzZepvs8&t=214.98s)]
