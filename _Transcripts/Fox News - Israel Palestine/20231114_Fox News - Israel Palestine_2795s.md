# State Dept. holds press briefing after bombshell memo surfaces on Israel-Hamas war
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU)
*  with ongoing negotiations, anything? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=0.0s)]
*  I don't have an update on hostage negotiations. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=3.12s)]
*  I think as you know, I've been reluctant to talk about [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=5.2s)]
*  the status of negotiations from this podium [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=7.24s)]
*  because it has been our position that anything that we say [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=9.96s)]
*  about hostage negotiations can jeopardize our work [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=13.72s)]
*  to try to secure the release of hostages. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=16.92s)]
*  So I don't have anything to say other than that [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=18.8s)]
*  it continues to be a top priority [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=20.6s)]
*  for everyone in this administration. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=22.6s)]
*  The Secretary has had a number of calls [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=23.8s)]
*  about this very matter with his foreign counterparts [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=25.32s)]
*  in the last few days and of course it was a subject [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=28.86s)]
*  that he worked on a great deal [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=31.18s)]
*  during his recent travel to the region, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=32.28s)]
*  but I don't wanna discuss any details. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=34.32s)]
*  Any word on the sanctions waiver expiring today for Iran? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=36.82s)]
*  So I don't have a comment to give [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=44.1s)]
*  on the expiration of the waiver at this time, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=46.86s)]
*  but I would remind you of a few things [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=50.1s)]
*  with respect to these waivers in general [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  and that is that number one, there are 20 waivers [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=54.3s)]
*  that have been issued for the payment from Iraq [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=57.1s)]
*  for Iranian electricity imports. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=61.9s)]
*  They go back to 2018, they started [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=64.82000000000001s)]
*  during the Trump administration. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=66.5s)]
*  All in each of these waivers, it has been the case [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=68.62s)]
*  that none of this money goes to Iran. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=71.38s)]
*  It is held in accounts that are restricted [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=74.46000000000001s)]
*  where they can only be used to pay for food, medicine, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=76.98s)]
*  humanitarian purposes and other non-sanctionable activities [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=80.3s)]
*  and it has been consistent with several policies [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=83.2s)]
*  that we have, one, to try to reduce Iran's leverage [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=86.32s)]
*  over Iraq and two, to try to wean Iraq [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=90.24s)]
*  from Iranian energy independence. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=94.69999999999999s)]
*  We've had a number of policies we've worked with [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=96.36s)]
*  to try to ensure their energy independence, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=98.11999999999999s)]
*  but in the meantime, they continue to buy [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=101.02s)]
*  Iranian electricity and so we have in the past, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=103.02s)]
*  as has the Trump administration, issued waivers [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=107.39999999999999s)]
*  to allow these funds to move to restricted accounts [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=110.38s)]
*  where as I said, they can be used for humanitarian [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=113.0s)]
*  and other non-sanctionable purposes. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=114.66s)]
*  Is there any concern about the potential optics of, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=116.3s)]
*  I guess, extending the sanctions waiver [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=121.74s)]
*  while Iranian proxy groups are attacking [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=123.7s)]
*  U.S. assets in the Middle East? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=130.38s)]
*  We don't worry about optics, we worry about reality [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  and the reality is that these funds, as I said, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=134.7s)]
*  can only be used for humanitarian [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=137.04s)]
*  and other non-sanctionable purposes [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=139.14s)]
*  and when it comes to holding Iran accountable [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=140.78s)]
*  for its destabilizing activities, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=142.88000000000002s)]
*  I would remind you that we have imposed [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  more than 400 sanctions on Iran [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=146.68s)]
*  since the outset of this administration. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=148.84s)]
*  In the past few weeks, we have taken a number of actions [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  to ensure deterrence and to, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=154.56s)]
*  the Pentagon has conducted strikes [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=158.04000000000002s)]
*  against Iranian-backed militias [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=160.32000000000002s)]
*  and we will continue to hold Iran accountable [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=161.88000000000002s)]
*  for its destabilizing behavior in a number of manners. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=164.26000000000002s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=168.18s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=169.3s)]
*  You don't worry about optics, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=171.28000000000003s)]
*  you worry about reality, aren't optics realing? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=173.5s)]
*  No, no. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=176.58s)]
*  I mean, we're gonna get into a bit of a metaphysical debate [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=178.5s)]
*  but I would say I'm not gonna, we're, yeah. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=181.70000000000002s)]
*  I wanted to say something about this [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=183.94s)]
*  but what you see is what you get, that's reality, right? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=184.78s)]
*  No, I would say what you see is what you get. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=188.86s)]
*  The optics, in the term I mean, the optics, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=193.54000000000002s)]
*  is people taking this and misinterpreting it [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=195.9s)]
*  and saying it's something that it's not, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=198.82s)]
*  which is what's happened in the past [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=200.3s)]
*  when it's come to these waivers [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=201.56s)]
*  and I'm making very clear that these waivers [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=203.14000000000001s)]
*  are something that have dated back [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=204.9s)]
*  to the Trump administration. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=206.62s)]
*  What is it that it is not? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=207.82s)]
*  What are you saying it isn't? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=210.06s)]
*  I will say what it is and I will let the, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=211.9s)]
*  those who tend to talk about these waivers [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=214.6s)]
*  over and over again, they can speak for themselves. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=216.68s)]
*  Well, okay, are you saying that this is [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=219.1s)]
*  an absolute straight-up renewal [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=221.46s)]
*  of what has been done in the past [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=223.42000000000002s)]
*  and there are no changes to it? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=225.82s)]
*  It doesn't allow the Iranians to convert [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=226.98000000000002s)]
*  money from Iraqi dinars into euros? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=231.86s)]
*  So I am not gonna speak to a new waiver. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=234.14000000000001s)]
*  One has not been issued at this point. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=237.02s)]
*  I'm speaking, so if we get to the point [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=239.46s)]
*  where we can talk about a new waiver, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=242.18s)]
*  I'll be happy to come in and talk about the specifics, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=243.18s)]
*  but all of our waivers in the past [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=244.66s)]
*  have made very clear that the funds are held in accounts, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=246.1s)]
*  not in Iran, and available only for humanitarian [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=248.82s)]
*  and non-sanctual purposes. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=251.1s)]
*  And you're saying that should there be a waiver [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=253.88s)]
*  this afternoon, it will be exactly the same? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=256.82s)]
*  I am not gonna talk about, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=259.5s)]
*  I'm not gonna talk about things that have not happened. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=260.79999999999995s)]
*  I'll be happy to, I won't be here tomorrow, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=262.96s)]
*  I'll be here Thursday, I'll be happy to talk about, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=264.67999999999995s)]
*  if something does happen the next time at this podium, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=266.23999999999995s)]
*  I will be happy to talk about it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=268.84s)]
*  All right, and then what about the fungibility argument [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=270.52s)]
*  that you heard a lot with money from South Korea [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=274.71999999999997s)]
*  for the hostages? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=278.32s)]
*  Why is that argument wrong? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=280.82s)]
*  So I will say we have heard this a lot, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=283.5s)]
*  we've addressed it a lot. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=285.96s)]
*  So with respect to the Iranian regime, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=287.29999999999995s)]
*  it has always funded destabilizing activities. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=291.18s)]
*  It has done that first and foremost, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=293.62s)]
*  it's one of its top priorities. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=295.65999999999997s)]
*  It does that whether it receives, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=297.26s)]
*  whether its people receive humanitarian benefits or not. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=299.09999999999997s)]
*  To the extent that the Iranian people have greater access [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=303.53999999999996s)]
*  to food or medicine as a result of money [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=306.09999999999997s)]
*  covered by this waiver, that's food or medicine [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=309.14s)]
*  that otherwise would not have been available to them. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=311.46s)]
*  And I would say, again, this is a policy [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=313.94s)]
*  that goes back to the previous administration. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=316.2s)]
*  The previous administration apparently decided [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=317.9s)]
*  that it was worthwhile to have this money spent [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=319.7s)]
*  for the benefit of the Iranian people [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=324.2s)]
*  with whom we have no quarrel. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=325.92s)]
*  Our quarrel is with the Iranian regime, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=327.24s)]
*  it's destabilizing activities. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=328.64s)]
*  And so what we see is an Iranian regime [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=330.8s)]
*  that whether these waivers are issued or not, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=334.84s)]
*  whether their people benefit from these monies or not, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=337.4s)]
*  continues to fund hostile activities. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=340.59999999999997s)]
*  That has not changed, it has not changed going back years. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=342.53999999999996s)]
*  Well, whether or not they benefit from this money, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=345.94s)]
*  isn't that the whole point? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=351.18s)]
*  The whole point is that they're supposed to. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=352.54s)]
*  But the problem is, and the argument against this, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=355.42s)]
*  is that the Iranians are gonna spend [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=359.88s)]
*  the same amount of money on their people [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=363.06s)]
*  as they did before, but now they've got [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=365.86s)]
*  another 10 billion or so to... [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=367.52000000000004s)]
*  I don't accept that argument. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=370.92s)]
*  What we believe... [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=372.92s)]
*  So inside, you know what the Iranians are doing? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=373.76s)]
*  What we believe is the Iranian regime [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=376.71999999999997s)]
*  is gonna spend the same amount of money [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=378.68s)]
*  on destabilizing activities because it always has, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=380.08s)]
*  and we will take actions to hold them accountable [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=383.0s)]
*  for those destabilizing activities [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=385.28s)]
*  as we have from the beginning of this administration. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=387.36s)]
*  What we have seen is that when these waivers [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=389.38s)]
*  have been issued, that money has been used [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=391.42s)]
*  for the benefit of the Iranian people, period. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=393.48s)]
*  Yeah, and then the money that they had inside of Iran [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=396.15999999999997s)]
*  that would have been spent on this is then freed up for... [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=399.24s)]
*  So you are making an assumption [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=402.44s)]
*  that the Iranian government... [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=403.76s)]
*  No, no, well, let me finish. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=405.26s)]
*  You are making an assumption, when you say that, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=406.94s)]
*  that the Iranian government is choosing the benefit [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=409.14s)]
*  of its people over funding terrorism [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=411.54s)]
*  and funding other destabilizing actions. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=414.18s)]
*  That's not what we've seen. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=415.78000000000003s)]
*  We've seen them... [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=416.78000000000003s)]
*  You're making that assumption. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=417.62s)]
*  No, no, I'm not. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=418.44s)]
*  I've seen them as a first priority, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=419.34000000000003s)]
*  fund destabilizing activities. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=421.18s)]
*  We think increasing the amount of money [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=423.14s)]
*  that flows for the benefit of the Iranian people [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=424.74s)]
*  is something that's worthwhile. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=426.42s)]
*  And again, this is the money that Iraq owes to Iran [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=427.38s)]
*  for electricity that Iran delivered. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=432.14s)]
*  But you're twisting it 180 degrees. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=434.76000000000005s)]
*  I think I... [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=438.96000000000004s)]
*  The opposite of what... [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=439.8s)]
*  I'm not saying that they're not gonna spend [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=441.52000000000004s)]
*  any of this money on food and medicine and... [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=444.52000000000004s)]
*  That's all this money can be spent on. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=447.56s)]
*  Yeah, but that means that they have X amount of dollars more [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=450.48s)]
*  in their own treasury that they can spend [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=456.48s)]
*  on destabilizing activities. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=459.44000000000005s)]
*  Only if you assume they were gonna fund food and medicine [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=462.09999999999997s)]
*  and other activities. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=465.26s)]
*  And I'm saying that's not a necessarily correct assumption. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=466.09999999999997s)]
*  They could make the choice... [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=468.46s)]
*  But you said that they were. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=469.3s)]
*  And you said also that even if they aren't spending [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=471.06s)]
*  that money, that they're gonna still fund [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=473.53999999999996s)]
*  destabilizing activities. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=475.18s)]
*  I said their first priority is to fund [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=476.5s)]
*  destabilizing activities. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=478.74s)]
*  That is the first... [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=479.86s)]
*  Why would you give them money? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=480.7s)]
*  Because this money will not... [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=482.09999999999997s)]
*  Not give them money, but why would you do this? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=482.94s)]
*  I feel like we're arguing in circles here a little bit. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=485.86s)]
*  Well, that's because... [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=488.09999999999997s)]
*  Not for the first time. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=488.94s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=490.18s)]
*  And this has gone back for several administrations now. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=491.56s)]
*  Because I don't understand your argument [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=495.2s)]
*  that you can be so sure that none of this money [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=497.76s)]
*  is going to increase the amount of cash [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=500.28000000000003s)]
*  that Iran spends to destabilize the region. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=502.90000000000003s)]
*  Because Iran does not when... [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=505.82s)]
*  What we see is when making its choices [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=507.76s)]
*  for how to spend its money, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=510.4s)]
*  the Iranian regime does not choose [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=512.24s)]
*  to feed its people first. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=513.6s)]
*  They choose to fund destabilizing activities first. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=515.52s)]
*  They always have. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=518.38s)]
*  As far as we can tell, they always will. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=519.52s)]
*  So when looking at this money, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=521.66s)]
*  we see the benefit to allowing these funds [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=523.94s)]
*  to move again to restricted accounts [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=526.96s)]
*  where they can only benefit the Iranian people. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=528.6800000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=531.78s)]
*  I just... [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=532.62s)]
*  Go ahead, Jen. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=533.8000000000001s)]
*  I don't understand how you can't see the problem [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=534.64s)]
*  with the logic of it. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=537.32s)]
*  I don't understand how you can't... [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=538.16s)]
*  What? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=539.0s)]
*  We don't understand each other, I think. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=541.1s)]
*  Go ahead, Jen. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=543.1800000000001s)]
*  Oh. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=544.18s)]
*  Oh. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=545.02s)]
*  I don't think we're allowed to. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=545.84s)]
*  I think we're stuck with each other. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=547.4399999999999s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=549.04s)]
*  No, let me... [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=549.88s)]
*  I'll come to you. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=550.72s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=551.56s)]
*  No, no, Jen had her hand up. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=552.38s)]
*  I will come. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=553.78s)]
*  I will come. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=555.6s)]
*  Okay, going back to the hostages, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=556.4399999999999s)]
*  so the president gave some indication of optimism [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=557.28s)]
*  that a deal is gonna be done. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=560.3199999999999s)]
*  What is underpinning that optimism right now? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=561.3199999999999s)]
*  Look, because we continue to work for it, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=563.8199999999999s)]
*  we are always hopeful that we will be able [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=566.22s)]
*  to secure the release of the deal. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=569.16s)]
*  We will be able to secure the release [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=571.78s)]
*  of not just the first and foremost, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=573.4399999999999s)]
*  the American citizens, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=575.48s)]
*  but all the hostages that are held, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=576.3199999999999s)]
*  certainly all the civilian hostages, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=577.6s)]
*  the women and children who have been now prisoners [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=579.64s)]
*  for more than a month. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=582.5s)]
*  So as long as there is a possibility to bring them home, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=584.5799999999999s)]
*  we will work to do it. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=588.04s)]
*  I just don't wanna talk about the underlying details [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=589.64s)]
*  that leads us to believe there's still a possibility [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=591.76s)]
*  to return them home. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=594.0799999999999s)]
*  Do you think there's been any concrete movement [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=594.92s)]
*  towards that end, towards an agreement? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=596.04s)]
*  There are ongoing discussions. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=598.4399999999999s)]
*  I don't wanna characterize where those discussions are. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=600.94s)]
*  And can you say whether any sort of iteration of a deal [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=602.2s)]
*  would include all 10 Americans who are believed to be? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=604.7600000000001s)]
*  Again, I don't wanna talk about what the contours [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=607.08s)]
*  of a deal might be before we've even reached an agreement. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=609.36s)]
*  Can I tell them all? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=611.96s)]
*  Guys, guys, guys, I will, I will, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=612.8000000000001s)]
*  I will let Jen finish, I will come. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=615.0400000000001s)]
*  Is it still the case that there is not a formal assessment [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=617.5600000000001s)]
*  being done by the US government [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=619.7600000000001s)]
*  into whether Israel is adhering to international humanitarian? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=620.96s)]
*  As I said yesterday, we monitor the use of our weapons, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=624.5600000000001s)]
*  we monitor all the actions that Israel takes [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=627.8000000000001s)]
*  because we monitor actions in any conflict, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=630.14s)]
*  but I'm not gonna speak to internal deliberations. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=631.66s)]
*  But there's no formal assessment. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=633.82s)]
*  There's not a formal assessment that's been made, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=635.62s)]
*  and I'm not gonna speak to internal deliberations [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=637.54s)]
*  inside the department. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=639.78s)]
*  All right, now, Said. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=641.22s)]
*  Thank you for your patience, such as it is. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=642.94s)]
*  I can wait all day, no problem. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=645.14s)]
*  A Hamas spokesman suggested that they will release [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=648.46s)]
*  70 hostages for a five-day pause. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=652.54s)]
*  Would that be acceptable? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=656.9s)]
*  I think you'll understand I'm not gonna negotiate [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=658.74s)]
*  in public about such a sensitive matter. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=661.28s)]
*  But this, I mean, on principle. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=663.52s)]
*  You can ask it a bunch of different ways. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=665.0s)]
*  I'm just not gonna take a negotiation question [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=666.48s)]
*  from the podium. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=669.16s)]
*  Can you update us on the status of the pauses? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=670.0s)]
*  We have had a pause of two. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=672.92s)]
*  Is that ongoing or did that stop? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=674.8s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=676.8s)]
*  I mean, from what we see and read and so on, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=677.64s)]
*  there are no pauses taking place. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=680.52s)]
*  There are pauses that are taking place. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=681.92s)]
*  So the secretary, this is something the secretary pushed [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=683.24s)]
*  for when we were in Israel. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=685.28s)]
*  We had very direct conversations [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=687.2s)]
*  with the prime minister about it. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=688.58s)]
*  You saw him come out and talk about those conversations [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=689.7s)]
*  afterwards, and then over the week, 10 days [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=692.34s)]
*  after we left Israel, you saw Israel begin to implement pauses [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=694.7s)]
*  and every day they announce pauses in areas [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=697.9000000000001s)]
*  to allow the evacuation of civilians [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=700.86s)]
*  along humanitarian corridors. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=704.22s)]
*  We said before, we think the pauses ought to be longer. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=705.72s)]
*  We will continue to engage in conversations [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=707.9200000000001s)]
*  about that with the government of Israel. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=709.94s)]
*  And one more thing. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=711.74s)]
*  Since Sunday, Sunday morning there, Saturday night here, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=713.9s)]
*  we have not seen any figures released from Shifa hospital [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=718.18s)]
*  because it's completely out of service. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=722.18s)]
*  The last count was like 11,000, 87, something like that. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=724.54s)]
*  Do you have any way of keeping track [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=729.4599999999999s)]
*  of the number of Palestinians killed? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=732.18s)]
*  We don't. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=734.02s)]
*  We don't have an accurate assessment or an assessment [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=734.5799999999999s)]
*  that we know to be accurate about the number of Palestinians [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=737.5s)]
*  who have been killed. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=740.56s)]
*  But as the secretary said last week, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=741.36s)]
*  we know that far too many innocent Palestinian civilians [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=743.1s)]
*  have been killed. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=745.7s)]
*  But with the hospitals out of service, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=746.38s)]
*  are we likely to know what's going on? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=751.62s)]
*  I don't know how I could speak to that from here. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=753.5s)]
*  I want to talk about, I want to ask about the West Bank, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=756.4200000000001s)]
*  but I can wait. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=758.3000000000001s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=759.3000000000001s)]
*  OK, on the West Bank, very quickly, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=760.22s)]
*  there's a rampage going on by the army, by the settlers, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=764.46s)]
*  and so on. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=767.3000000000001s)]
*  Last night they went into Tulka and Jenin and so on. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=768.0s)]
*  They killed 12 Palestinians or 10 Palestinians. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=770.7s)]
*  The number has exceeded 200 since October 7 and so on. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=773.1800000000001s)]
*  I mean, just total destruction. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=777.46s)]
*  Are you guys concerned? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=778.38s)]
*  Are you doing anything to make sure that things don't really [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=779.34s)]
*  blow out of our hands? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=782.98s)]
*  We are very concerned about this issue. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=783.74s)]
*  You've heard the secretary speak to this. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=785.4000000000001s)]
*  He spoke to it when we were in Israel, in fact. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=787.0200000000001s)]
*  The secretary has made very clear [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=790.0600000000001s)]
*  that we condemn extremist violence and harassment [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=791.46s)]
*  against Palestinians. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=794.0600000000001s)]
*  He had a very direct conversation [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=795.38s)]
*  with the prime minister about it, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=796.9000000000001s)]
*  what he said to the prime minister [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=798.0600000000001s)]
*  and other members of the Israeli War Cabinet [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=799.5s)]
*  is that the extremist violence against settlers [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=801.86s)]
*  is unacceptable, that we think the government needs [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=804.38s)]
*  to do more to rein it in, and they [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=806.74s)]
*  need to do more to hold people accountable. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=808.1s)]
*  And we will be watching to see what steps they take. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=810.3000000000001s)]
*  But it has accelerated since this conversation. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=812.98s)]
*  I'm telling you, we expect them to take action, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=815.82s)]
*  and we will be watching to see that they do. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=818.4200000000001s)]
*  Can we go back to the other first? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=820.4200000000001s)]
*  I told Olivia to come to her next. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=821.3000000000001s)]
*  On Chippa Hospital, I know you and others [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=823.9000000000001s)]
*  in the administration have spoken generally [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=826.98s)]
*  about information you have about hospitals [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=829.06s)]
*  and Hamas operating under them. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=830.6999999999999s)]
*  Is the US taking any steps to declassify, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=832.74s)]
*  to share more information about what it has [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=836.02s)]
*  specifically regarding Chippa? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=837.86s)]
*  So I don't want to talk about what we may or may not [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=839.5s)]
*  declassify before we take any action, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=842.86s)]
*  just as I don't really want to talk about [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=845.5s)]
*  intelligence matters from the podium. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=847.38s)]
*  As I said yesterday, as you heard [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=849.38s)]
*  the national security advisor say over the weekend, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=850.5799999999999s)]
*  and as the secretary has spoken to, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=853.22s)]
*  we do know that Hamas has used hospitals as command centers, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=854.54s)]
*  and it's buried in tunnels under command centers. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=859.86s)]
*  And I want to say something about hospitals. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=862.46s)]
*  Number one, we want hospitals to be protected. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=866.14s)]
*  We don't want to see any civilians, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=869.62s)]
*  and certainly not babies in incubators [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=871.06s)]
*  or other vulnerable populations caught in a crossfire. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=873.02s)]
*  We want Hamas to stop using hospitals as command posts. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=877.5s)]
*  That would be the easiest way to solve this problem, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=880.54s)]
*  if they would stop using the civilians [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=882.62s)]
*  either in hospitals as humanitarian shields. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=884.18s)]
*  But then I would also say that we want there [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=886.9s)]
*  to be safe evacuation for patients at hospitals [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=888.8599999999999s)]
*  so they can get out of harm's way. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=891.26s)]
*  We would support an independent third party [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=893.78s)]
*  or respected third party to conduct those evacuations. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=895.9799999999999s)]
*  We know the government of Israel [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=898.78s)]
*  would support such a step as well. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=899.8599999999999s)]
*  They have said that they would support such a step. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=901.9399999999999s)]
*  The question is, will Hamas allow patients [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=903.8599999999999s)]
*  to be evacuated from hospitals, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=906.0999999999999s)]
*  or will they continue to use them as human shields? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=907.7399999999999s)]
*  We think an appropriate step would be [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=910.38s)]
*  to support those evacuations, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=911.74s)]
*  so babies and other vulnerable populations [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=912.94s)]
*  are not in harm's way. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=915.34s)]
*  Well, on that front, so one, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=916.3800000000001s)]
*  has a third party candidate been identified [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=918.6600000000001s)]
*  to effectuate those kind of evacuations? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=921.34s)]
*  And then on the Hamas front, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=923.1800000000001s)]
*  has the US made an appeal through the Qataris [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=924.3800000000001s)]
*  or anyone else to do exactly what you just said? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=926.7s)]
*  So we are in a number, we are in conversations [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=929.22s)]
*  with a number of humanitarian organizations [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=931.74s)]
*  and third parties about this very topic. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=933.98s)]
*  I don't want to speak to those issues in detail, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=936.1400000000001s)]
*  but it is very much something that we would support. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=938.2600000000001s)]
*  I will just say, generally, we have sent messages [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=941.0200000000001s)]
*  through the Qataris and through other counterparts [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=945.3000000000001s)]
*  in the region to Hamas that, of course, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=947.22s)]
*  just as we've said, they should release the hospitals, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=949.0600000000001s)]
*  that they should allow evacuation of wounded civilians [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=950.74s)]
*  and stop using them as human shields. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=954.3000000000001s)]
*  Specifically on the babies, just given the urgency [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=955.9000000000001s)]
*  and the fragility of the lives at stake there. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=958.3000000000001s)]
*  Conversations are one thing, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=961.0600000000001s)]
*  but are you really pushing the gas pedal here? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=962.26s)]
*  We could not agree more. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=964.82s)]
*  Look, to state matters like, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=966.62s)]
*  we do not control what Hamas does. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=968.98s)]
*  We would like Hamas to just move out of the hospitals. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=971.78s)]
*  As I said, that would be the easiest way [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=973.82s)]
*  to solve this issue. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=975.46s)]
*  But absent that, if they refuse to remove [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=978.14s)]
*  their command centers from hospitals, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=980.86s)]
*  as they seem likely to do, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=982.34s)]
*  they've been burying their command centers [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=983.3000000000001s)]
*  under hospitals for years, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=985.38s)]
*  the step that we think would be appropriate [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=987.22s)]
*  for them to take would be to allow evacuation. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=988.82s)]
*  And yes, we would very much encourage them to do. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=991.02s)]
*  Will they do it? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=992.9s)]
*  We have seen them, one of their prime strategies [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=994.74s)]
*  has been to use civilians as human shields, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=997.1s)]
*  not just in hospitals, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1000.7s)]
*  but in other civilian infrastructure throughout Gaza. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1001.78s)]
*  So we would certainly hope that they would. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1004.9s)]
*  And if they don't, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1007.9s)]
*  I think it speaks to their true motivations here. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1008.78s)]
*  I have another question that's in the region, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1011.02s)]
*  but sort of ancillary to everything that's going on. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1012.5400000000001s)]
*  So I can pose it or you can come back. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1014.26s)]
*  We'll come back. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1016.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1017.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1018.1800000000001s)]
*  On hostages, I know you don't wanna talk about this, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1019.38s)]
*  but some of the information that was leaked out, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1022.78s)]
*  that basically they will release 80 women and children [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1025.22s)]
*  in return for women and Palestinian children [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1028.5s)]
*  who are in Israeli jails. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1032.06s)]
*  Can you take this question, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1033.9s)]
*  if you don't know the answer, please? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1034.8600000000001s)]
*  No, can you please tell us if Israel, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1036.82s)]
*  if you're aware of Israel holding [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1039.34s)]
*  Palestinian children in jail? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1041.5s)]
*  Just take the question, you can verify it. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1043.3s)]
*  So I'm just not gonna speak to hostage negotiations [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1045.22s)]
*  with respect to that factual question. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1047.82s)]
*  That's a question for the government of Israel, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1049.38s)]
*  but as it relates to hostage negotiations, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1051.22s)]
*  I'm not gonna speak to that at all. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1053.7s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1055.18s)]
*  The Israeli foreign minister said that [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1056.46s)]
*  the secretary general, Mr. Antonio Alterish, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1059.18s)]
*  is not qualified to lead the UN or the world. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1062.3s)]
*  Do you agree with him and how do you differentiate [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1065.3400000000001s)]
*  between somebody who is obviously being critical of Israel [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1068.3s)]
*  and people who are gonna be labeled as antisemitic? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1071.94s)]
*  How can we have this debate [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1075.46s)]
*  where there's legitimate criticism of Israel [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1076.98s)]
*  and not be put in the category that people are antisemitic? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1080.06s)]
*  So with respect to the first one, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1083.1s)]
*  I will let the foreign minister speak to his own comments. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1084.5s)]
*  But I'll say we support the work that the UN has done [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1087.6999999999998s)]
*  to get humanitarian relief into Israel. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1089.74s)]
*  We'll continue to work with the UN [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1093.8999999999999s)]
*  and its various agencies to try to get work, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1095.3s)]
*  relief into Israel, and that includes with, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1098.1799999999998s)]
*  of course, the secretary general. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1100.2199999999998s)]
*  And with respect to the first question, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1101.5s)]
*  of course, legitimate criticism of Israel is appropriate. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1103.82s)]
*  Just as criticism of any government is appropriate, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1107.78s)]
*  we welcome criticism of our government. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1110.62s)]
*  I won't speak for other governments. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1113.9399999999998s)]
*  Obviously, many governments don't welcome [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1115.34s)]
*  such criticism around the world. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1117.02s)]
*  But that's a different matter than antisemitism, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1118.9799999999998s)]
*  which we very much abhor and condemn. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1120.78s)]
*  And finally, there's a lawsuit, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1123.3s)]
*  I don't know if you're aware of it, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1125.1399999999999s)]
*  against the secretary of state, the president, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1126.6999999999998s)]
*  and the defense secretary in New York. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1128.6999999999998s)]
*  It was filed yesterday in the federal court [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1131.58s)]
*  and they're saying basically that they failed to prevent [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1134.06s)]
*  an aid in genocide in Gaza. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1136.6599999999999s)]
*  Are you aware of this? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1139.1s)]
*  I've seen the litigation, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1141.3s)]
*  but I won't comment on litigation. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1143.34s)]
*  I'll refer that to the Justice Department for comment. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1145.02s)]
*  The House was set to vote on a budget today [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1149.62s)]
*  without any aid for Israel or Ukraine. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1152.74s)]
*  How concerned are you about that, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1155.34s)]
*  and when does this become critical? [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1157.02s)]
*  So we are at a critical point [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1159.54s)]
*  with respect to aid to Ukraine. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1161.3s)]
*  The Pentagon has said publicly that they have exhausted [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1162.74s)]
*  somewhere around 95% of their funds [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1165.7s)]
*  to provide security assistance to Ukraine, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1168.14s)]
*  security assistance that's very important. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1170.0200000000002s)]
*  We think it's urgent that the House pass [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1172.6200000000001s)]
*  the supplemental requests that we made, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1176.0200000000002s)]
*  not just to fund security assistance to Ukraine, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1178.18s)]
*  not just to fund security assistance to Israel, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1181.26s)]
*  but also to fund the humanitarian assistance [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1184.38s)]
*  that we have requested for the people of Gaza, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1186.9s)]
*  which we think is critically important, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1190.7800000000002s)]
*  both for their safety and well-being [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1192.18s)]
*  and for Israel's long-term security interests. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1193.7800000000002s)]
*  As Secretary Barbara Alif is headed back to the region, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1197.58s)]
*  any particular message she's carrying [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1201.74s)]
*  on behalf of the Secretary? [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1203.98s)]
*  Yeah, I think you'll see her continue the work [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1205.38s)]
*  that the Secretary launched in his two trips to the region, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1207.06s)]
*  trying to achieve many of the same objectives. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1210.06s)]
*  One, to ensure that Israel is able to defend itself [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1211.86s)]
*  against terrorism while respecting humanitarian law, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1216.14s)]
*  that we are trying to secure the release of hostages, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1219.22s)]
*  that we are trying to secure the delivery [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1222.58s)]
*  of humanitarian assistance into Ra'aqa [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1224.82s)]
*  and facilitate the departure of American citizens from Ra'aqa. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1227.18s)]
*  There are now over 600 American citizens [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1231.06s)]
*  and lawful permanent residents and their family members [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1233.62s)]
*  who have departed Gaza through Ra'aqa Gate. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1235.78s)]
*  There are somewhere, there are a little under a thousand [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1238.02s)]
*  that we know of that are left now, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1240.34s)]
*  whose departure we hope to facilitate over the coming days [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1241.78s)]
*  should they wish to depart. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1245.22s)]
*  And of course, you will continue to work [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1246.98s)]
*  to try and prevent the conflict from spreading, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1248.42s)]
*  which has been one of our top objectives from the outset. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1250.1s)]
*  I'm back to Iran. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1253.1s)]
*  I will bring up to a quote from the Secretary this morning. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1253.9399999999998s)]
*  He said in a statement that Iran's support, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1257.1s)]
*  primarily through IRGC, enables Hamas [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1259.26s)]
*  and PIJ's terrorist activities, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1262.82s)]
*  including through the transfer of funds [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1265.26s)]
*  and operational training. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1267.4599999999998s)]
*  I assume you still stand by this statement. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1268.9399999999998s)]
*  And if that's the case. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1270.6999999999998s)]
*  Absolutely, and I think you're referring to a statement [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1271.74s)]
*  he made imposing sanctions on Hamas [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1273.9399999999998s)]
*  to prevent it from accessing the financial system, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1276.62s)]
*  which is the exact kind of sanctions [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1278.74s)]
*  we have imposed on Iran over 400 times [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1280.66s)]
*  in this administration to prevent them [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1283.3400000000001s)]
*  from conducting these destabilizing activities. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1284.8200000000002s)]
*  But the argument is that aren't we deluding ourselves [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1287.0600000000002s)]
*  when expecting that a regime, a terrorist, as you might [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1289.38s)]
*  should say, of that nature, when he gets his hands [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1291.8200000000002s)]
*  on 10 additional billion dollars, will act differently. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1294.26s)]
*  So I think you were mistaken. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1297.3000000000002s)]
*  You were misstating several facts. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1298.9s)]
*  They get their hands on zero additional dollars [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1300.38s)]
*  as a result of these waivers. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1303.22s)]
*  Again, none of these funds are sent to Iran. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1304.38s)]
*  They are held in third party accounts outside Iran [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1306.8600000000001s)]
*  and can be used only for humanitarian [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1309.46s)]
*  and other non-sanctionable purposes [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1312.5s)]
*  for the benefits of the Iranian people. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1314.06s)]
*  There's no concern whatsoever on your end [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1315.74s)]
*  that Iran might get emboldened by this action. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1317.7s)]
*  You think Iran is gonna get more emboldened [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1320.74s)]
*  than it is already because of this action? [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1322.42s)]
*  These are sanctions that have been going, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1324.06s)]
*  these are waivers that have been issued going back to 2018. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1325.66s)]
*  We have seen Iran continue its destabilizing activities [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1328.3400000000001s)]
*  throughout that time, just as they did [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1330.98s)]
*  before the Trump administration issued [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1332.7s)]
*  the first of these waivers in 2018. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1334.38s)]
*  Which is why we have held them accountable [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1336.46s)]
*  through strikes against their proxy militias [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1338.7s)]
*  in the region and through the sanctions I just referred to [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1341.06s)]
*  as well as a number of other measures. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1343.1000000000001s)]
*  I think you're about to. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1344.74s)]
*  Well, no, I'm not going to. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1348.3400000000001s)]
*  But I just do not understand why it is [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1349.74s)]
*  that you're so single-mindedly refusing [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1353.8600000000001s)]
*  to understand at least the argument [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1358.5800000000002s)]
*  that this money is going to be able to be used [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1364.3400000000001s)]
*  by Iran and that when they do use it [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1368.78s)]
*  and they use $1 million to buy medicine of this money, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1371.6599999999999s)]
*  that that frees up another million dollars [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1377.82s)]
*  that they would have had to spend on this [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1380.7399999999998s)]
*  without the sanctions waiver. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1384.78s)]
*  So I understand the argument, I don't agree with it, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1389.78s)]
*  and here's why. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1393.02s)]
*  If they were sitting on that $1 million, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1394.02s)]
*  they would use it for their destabilizing activities [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1395.82s)]
*  to fund terrorism and deny medicine to their people. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1399.22s)]
*  That's the point I'm making. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1401.3400000000001s)]
*  And so to approve $1 million of say medical transactions [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1402.8200000000002s)]
*  to benefit the Iranian people, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1407.02s)]
*  we believe those are benefits to the Iranian people [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1408.38s)]
*  that they would not have otherwise gotten. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1410.78s)]
*  So it's just a lost cause then. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1412.38s)]
*  You're just saying that they're going to [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1413.3400000000001s)]
*  fund destabilizing activities regardless [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1415.22s)]
*  of whether you give them the waiver or not. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1417.5800000000002s)]
*  I think they have shown that they are going to [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1419.3400000000001s)]
*  conduct destabilizing activities. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1423.7s)]
*  They were doing it before 2018 [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1425.02s)]
*  when the Trump administration gave them the first waiver, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1426.38s)]
*  which is why we have an entire set of policies [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1428.7800000000002s)]
*  to hold them accountable for those destabilizing activities. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1432.6200000000001s)]
*  And part of our policy has always been [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1435.18s)]
*  not to penalize the Iranian people. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1437.66s)]
*  There is no country in the world [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1439.3400000000001s)]
*  where we deny access to food and medicine [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1441.1000000000001s)]
*  and where our sanctions target food and medicine [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1443.2600000000002s)]
*  and other humanitarian goods to the people. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1445.94s)]
*  That's true with respect to Russia, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1447.9s)]
*  it's true with respect to Iran, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1449.3400000000001s)]
*  it's true with respect to every country in the world, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1450.6200000000001s)]
*  and it always has been. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1452.66s)]
*  That is the policy of the United States. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1453.94s)]
*  On this, what about the timing, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1456.74s)]
*  the waiver's timing, and second, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1460.3799999999999s)]
*  did Iran help in preventing Hezbollah [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1462.3799999999999s)]
*  from launching a full war against Israel? [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1465.62s)]
*  And third, did Iran receive the $6 billion [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1469.22s)]
*  that South Korea transferred to it through Qatar? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1473.02s)]
*  So three things. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1476.7s)]
*  Again, the timing, the waiver hasn't been issued [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1477.6599999999999s)]
*  at this point. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1480.86s)]
*  I'll be happy to talk more about a waiver [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1481.7s)]
*  if and when it has been issued, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1483.1s)]
*  but the timing is that the previous waiver expires today. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1484.62s)]
*  So that's with respect to timing. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1487.3799999999999s)]
*  With respect to Hezbollah, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1489.7399999999998s)]
*  I won't speak for what actions Iran has taken, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1491.4199999999998s)]
*  I will speak for the United States, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1494.3799999999999s)]
*  and we have sent very loud and clear messages [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1495.4199999999998s)]
*  that we think that any party hostile to Israel [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1498.02s)]
*  should not enter this conflict. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1500.1399999999999s)]
*  We have sent public messages to that effect, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1502.8999999999999s)]
*  you've seen the President speak to it, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1505.1s)]
*  and we have sent private messages to that effect, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1506.3s)]
*  and we hope that they will be received, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1508.6999999999998s)]
*  and if they're not, we will be prepared to take action. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1510.82s)]
*  And with respect to the third question, [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1513.82s)]
*  if I understand that, no, that money has yet to be spent. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1516.22s)]
*  And did you ask Iran to ask Hezbollah [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1519.02s)]
*  not to launch a war, a full war on Israel? [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1522.02s)]
*  I'm just not gonna talk about messages [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1524.26s)]
*  other than to say that we have made very clear publicly [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1526.46s)]
*  and through private channels [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1528.58s)]
*  that no party should escalate this conflict. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1530.3s)]
*  Simon, go ahead. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1533.26s)]
*  Different subject, sorry. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1534.1s)]
*  No, no, no, we need to do more. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1536.26s)]
*  Can we just get an update [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1539.42s)]
*  on the Russian-American journalist [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1542.4199999999998s)]
*  for Radio Free Europe, Radio Liberty, Alsu Kermasheva. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1544.1s)]
*  Her husband is calling for her to be designated [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1548.6999999999998s)]
*  as wrongfully detained. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1550.98s)]
*  Can we expect such a designation? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1553.4199999999998s)]
*  In the case of Evan Gershkovich, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1556.1799999999998s)]
*  who was also detained in Russia, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1557.4199999999998s)]
*  it happened within, I think, 10 or 11 days. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1558.34s)]
*  What's the holdup of getting a determination? [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1562.9399999999998s)]
*  So I don't have any update. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1565.1399999999999s)]
*  We continue to request consular access for her, [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1566.1799999999998s)]
*  and it has not yet been granted. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1568.98s)]
*  And I would just say with respect to wrongful detainees, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1571.06s)]
*  every circumstance is different. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1574.7s)]
*  We look at each of these and try to make a determination [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1577.5s)]
*  as quickly as we can, but we have to gather [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1579.78s)]
*  all the appropriate facts before making a determination. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1581.34s)]
*  And I don't think anyone should read into [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1584.34s)]
*  the amount of time it takes in one case [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1586.74s)]
*  versus the amount of time it takes in another case, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1588.42s)]
*  what our determination is gonna be [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1591.34s)]
*  or what our priority is gonna be. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1593.5s)]
*  It's just that every circumstance is different. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1594.78s)]
*  So is it, just to confirm, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1597.06s)]
*  there is a process underway to determine yes or no? [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1599.42s)]
*  We always, I don't wanna speak to a formal process, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1602.7800000000002s)]
*  but we always look at these cases overseas [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1605.46s)]
*  and determine whether we should make such a, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1607.8600000000001s)]
*  look at whether we should make such a determination or not. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1609.8200000000002s)]
*  And you haven't had any consular access? [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1611.8600000000001s)]
*  We have not. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1613.66s)]
*  You haven't been formally informed of her detention? [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1614.48s)]
*  As far as I'm aware, it's possible the embassy's [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1616.5800000000002s)]
*  had something today that I'm not aware of, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1619.46s)]
*  but as far as I'm aware, we have not. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1620.46s)]
*  Similar vein, is the department offering any guidance [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1623.42s)]
*  on the situation of the women of Tukov, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1625.74s)]
*  the Princeton researcher, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1627.98s)]
*  a video of her surfaced yesterday. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1629.78s)]
*  Has the US authenticated that video in any way? [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1631.22s)]
*  So we've seen the video. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1633.5s)]
*  I don't think we have any way to authenticate it, [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1634.5800000000002s)]
*  but we strongly condemn her abduction as we have before. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1636.1000000000001s)]
*  We know she was conducting research in Baghdad [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1641.24s)]
*  at the time of her abduction. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1643.42s)]
*  She's affiliated with a higher education institution [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1645.78s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1648.8600000000001s)]
*  And I would just say, as is always the case, [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1649.7s)]
*  when you have hostage videos or videos of people [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1652.0800000000002s)]
*  that have been abducted, [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1654.54s)]
*  you should not take the claims made in those videos [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1656.62s)]
*  at face value, and you have to consider the source [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1658.62s)]
*  of those videos and understand that their captors [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1661.52s)]
*  may have ulterior motives, to say the least. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1663.62s)]
*  All right, go ahead. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1667.9799999999998s)]
*  I think part of this war is misinformation, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1670.6999999999998s)]
*  which is spreading widely across social media. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1672.3799999999999s)]
*  Yesterday, the IDF spokesman posted a video [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1674.4599999999998s)]
*  in the basement of Renteci Children Hospital, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1679.1799999999998s)]
*  pointing to a random calendar, and he said that, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1681.1s)]
*  this is evidence of hostage keepers and terrorist names. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1683.34s)]
*  And it was debunked and showed that it was [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1686.54s)]
*  like a regular calendar. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1689.18s)]
*  More of these are being spread, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1691.4199999999998s)]
*  like a nurse being said that she was in the hospital, [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1693.3799999999999s)]
*  and it was later debunked to be like an Israeli actress. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1696.62s)]
*  Does this administration examine misinformation [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1701.36s)]
*  widely spread, especially from the Israeli part? [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1703.4199999999998s)]
*  Because we heard here on this podium repeatedly, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1707.06s)]
*  you saying that the number of killed was 1,400 [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1709.58s)]
*  when it was 1,200. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1712.62s)]
*  Do you ask and look into these information and evidence, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1714.6999999999998s)]
*  or do you believe them blindly? [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1718.7199999999998s)]
*  We look at a number of different claims. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1719.86s)]
*  I don't know if that information about the calendar [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1721.58s)]
*  has been debunked. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1723.6799999999998s)]
*  I read in a prominent American newspaper today [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1724.52s)]
*  that in fact it showed on that calendar, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1727.58s)]
*  used the name for October 7th that Hamas uses. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1730.78s)]
*  I have no way to, hold on. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1734.58s)]
*  Let me just, let me just finish. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1735.9799999999998s)]
*  It's like Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1738.26s)]
*  Let me make my point. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1740.4599999999998s)]
*  I have no way of either verifying [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1742.1s)]
*  or debunking that information. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1744.1399999999999s)]
*  And it goes to the point, [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1745.4199999999998s)]
*  please, I did not interrupt you [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1747.1799999999998s)]
*  when you're asking a question. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1748.62s)]
*  There's plenty of time for people to ask questions. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1750.06s)]
*  It goes to the point I was making yesterday [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1752.24s)]
*  that in the fog of war, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1754.1399999999999s)]
*  from thousands of miles away at the podium, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1755.5s)]
*  I have no way to independently adjudicate [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1757.48s)]
*  the various claims that are being made. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1759.8s)]
*  I will come back to the core principles that we state, [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1761.74s)]
*  which is that we expect Israel to, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1764.86s)]
*  you know, that we expect Israel to operate [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1766.6599999999999s)]
*  with respect to humanitarian law. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1769.78s)]
*  And I do want to restate the broader point [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1771.18s)]
*  with respect to hospitals that I said earlier, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1775.14s)]
*  which is Hamas has long used hospitals as command centers. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1777.22s)]
*  I can't speak to every individual claim. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1783.94s)]
*  I'm not gonna speak to intelligence that we have, [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1785.8200000000002s)]
*  and I can't adjudicate the various pieces of information [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1787.38s)]
*  from here when I'm thousands of miles away. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1789.98s)]
*  But I think it's fairly well known, [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1791.98s)]
*  and if not accepted, I would hope it would be [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1793.54s)]
*  that Hamas uses civilians as human shields. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1796.22s)]
*  And I'm a little surprised that there are people [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1799.94s)]
*  that continue to challenge that claim, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1801.9s)]
*  despite the evidence going back years, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1804.14s)]
*  from well before October 7th, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1805.98s)]
*  that Hamas has used mosques and schools [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1807.7s)]
*  and other civilian infrastructure [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1811.3s)]
*  for its own terrorist purposes. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1817.5s)]
*  Yeah, but my question is about misinformation. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1819.5800000000002s)]
*  Like we heard a lot of recordings [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1821.3600000000001s)]
*  that you can see the accent, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1824.42s)]
*  it's not like a proper Arabic accent. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1825.8200000000002s)]
*  We've seen this calendar that is like so easy [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1827.6000000000001s)]
*  to know that it's dates, it's days. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1830.54s)]
*  It's not anything, there's nothing on it. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1832.3s)]
*  This is my question. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1834.5s)]
*  I am just not able to speak to individual claims. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1835.34s)]
*  Of course we monitor all this, [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1837.9s)]
*  and we try to reach our own factual determinations, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1839.38s)]
*  as we do in any conflict. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1842.66s)]
*  Okay, and on Lebanon, yesterday a group of media journalists [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1844.02s)]
*  was a target to an Israeli airstrike [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1846.94s)]
*  on the southern borders of Lebanon. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1849.18s)]
*  A month ago, a month ago today, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1851.22s)]
*  like also an Israeli airstrike killed [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1853.26s)]
*  a Reuters correspondent. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1856.66s)]
*  So do you have any comment on that? [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1858.34s)]
*  We mourn the loss of every civilian life in this conflict, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1860.1799999999998s)]
*  whether they be Israeli, whether they be Palestinian, [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1863.56s)]
*  Lebanese, or citizens of any other country. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1866.06s)]
*  And I've spoken to this before, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1870.6599999999999s)]
*  we know that journalists put themselves in harm's way [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1872.54s)]
*  to bring the truth to people around the world. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1874.9399999999998s)]
*  And we commend them for that activity. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1877.8999999999999s)]
*  It's one of the bravest acts you can ask anyone to do. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1880.02s)]
*  And of course when a journalist loses their life, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1882.58s)]
*  we are deeply sorry for that having occurred. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1884.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1888.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1889.4199999999998s)]
*  You know, you say that you can't adjudicate every example. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1890.26s)]
*  This is very similar to the discussion we had [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1893.78s)]
*  about civilian losses in airstrikes as well. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1895.82s)]
*  But just to point out that the department has, you know, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1900.3999999999999s)]
*  the Global Engagement Center that is constantly [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1905.54s)]
*  putting out material about governments around the world, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1908.9599999999998s)]
*  you know, doing disinformation, misinformation. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1913.3799999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1915.74s)]
*  Is that something that you would look at? [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1916.9s)]
*  And you know, there's some examples there. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1918.46s)]
*  There are other examples that have come out [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1920.26s)]
*  of the Israeli government, sure, Hamas as well, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1922.5s)]
*  but you know, is that something? [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1925.14s)]
*  If we saw examples of disinformation, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1926.8600000000001s)]
*  of course it's something we would look at and call out. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1928.98s)]
*  But you do have to remember the fog of war, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1931.1200000000001s)]
*  and in the fog of war, everyone makes mistakes. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1933.14s)]
*  I'm not saying that's what happened here. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1934.94s)]
*  As I said, I have no way to independently determine myself. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1936.02s)]
*  But there is a difference between governments [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1938.3400000000001s)]
*  or individuals that make mistakes or that make, you know, [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1941.2s)]
*  make claims that they then later have to update [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1943.8200000000002s)]
*  when new facts become available [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1945.58s)]
*  and intentional deliberate misinformation [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1947.54s)]
*  over a sustained period of time. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1950.22s)]
*  I guess people might say you have these parts [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1951.86s)]
*  of the department that call out governments [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1954.8799999999999s)]
*  for misinformation, but it tends to be the governments [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1956.58s)]
*  that you're adversaries, right? [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1959.5s)]
*  So I guess, you know, you could show some willingness [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1961.34s)]
*  to make those same judgments when it comes [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1966.6999999999998s)]
*  to your friends like Israel. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1970.22s)]
*  So if we saw a sustained, deliberate [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1972.34s)]
*  misinformation campaign by Israel or any other government, [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1974.9399999999998s)]
*  of course we would call it out. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1977.78s)]
*  I will say it tends to be not democracies [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1979.06s)]
*  with whom we are allies and partners [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1981.34s)]
*  that conduct misinformation campaigns, [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1983.1399999999999s)]
*  but authoritarian regimes. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1985.3999999999999s)]
*  So I think it's natural that you will see us calling it out [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1986.58s)]
*  more in those circumstances, authoritarian regimes [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1990.02s)]
*  that don't have a free press to challenge the information [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1993.06s)]
*  being put out by the government. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1995.76s)]
*  But if we see any kind of deliberate [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1997.08s)]
*  misinformation campaign, of course we would call it out [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=1999.1399999999999s)]
*  no matter who it was. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2002.42s)]
*  Okay, ask, go ahead. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2004.78s)]
*  Can I take one? [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2006.42s)]
*  I have two questions. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2007.26s)]
*  Yesterday I asked you about Russian delegation, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2008.08s)]
*  particularly Russian depute prime minister [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2009.86s)]
*  who will be present at the summit, [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2011.42s)]
*  at the leader summit in San Francisco. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2014.02s)]
*  Turns out it is Alexei Overtchuk who got sanctioned [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2015.78s)]
*  by the EU last December for Russia's brutal [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2018.98s)]
*  actions in Ukraine. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2023.6200000000001s)]
*  Do you have any issue with the fact that [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2025.02s)]
*  a EU sanctioned Russian official will be in the same room [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2026.9s)]
*  as the president? [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2030.14s)]
*  So I will let the EU speak to their sanctions. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2032.8600000000001s)]
*  I will say that as the host of APEC, [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2035.14s)]
*  we have a responsibility, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2037.18s)]
*  or I will say we take our host obligation responsibility [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2038.98s)]
*  and that includes hosting officials [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2041.98s)]
*  from all the members of APEC, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2044.3400000000001s)]
*  but we do it consistent with US sanctions policy [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2045.88s)]
*  and rules and regulations. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2049.2400000000002s)]
*  But you don't consider this as a violation [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2050.38s)]
*  of EU sanctions. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2051.9s)]
*  I'm not gonna get into technical sanctions questions. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2053.2200000000003s)]
*  I will say we have an obligation as the host. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2055.96s)]
*  We attend, one of the things about diplomacy [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2058.48s)]
*  is you attend a lot of meetings with people [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2061.7999999999997s)]
*  whose policies you object to [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2063.6s)]
*  and sometimes you object to things that they've done, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2065.48s)]
*  but we have a responsibility to conduct diplomacy [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2067.18s)]
*  on behalf of the United States. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2069.08s)]
*  My second question on Karabakh. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2070.44s)]
*  I heard of tomorrow's congressional hearing. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2072.44s)]
*  I'm just wondering if you have any preview of [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2073.96s)]
*  what you guys can say in terms of the future [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2075.68s)]
*  of Karabakh. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2077.72s)]
*  You have Azerbaijan on one hand celebrating [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2078.68s)]
*  the victory in a town surrounded by Russian army. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2080.7999999999997s)]
*  You have Armenia is being bullied by Russia [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2084.04s)]
*  every single day saying that, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2086.36s)]
*  can't go anywhere, I'm not gonna go anywhere. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2087.6s)]
*  So is there any happy ending there in your opinion? [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2089.44s)]
*  I will just say what I've said before. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2092.0s)]
*  I don't wanna speak to the meeting [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2093.48s)]
*  that's gonna happen tomorrow, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2094.44s)]
*  but I'll say that we continue to believe [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2095.28s)]
*  that people who have left Nagorno-Karabakh [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2098.0s)]
*  have the right to come home if they wish to do so [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2101.1600000000003s)]
*  and that's a right that should be upheld. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2104.6400000000003s)]
*  You go, go ahead. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2106.88s)]
*  I asked Vedant the other day when you were in Asia, [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2110.08s)]
*  then I asked the European desk, [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2115.52s)]
*  and I want to ask you two, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2118.84s)]
*  do you consider the occupation of Cyprus [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2121.04s)]
*  by your allies the Turks an occupation or something else? [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2123.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm sure you know the answer they gave me. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2128.96s)]
*  They said to me, we believe the sovereignty [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2131.7999999999997s)]
*  and territorial integrity of all countries [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2135.44s)]
*  should be respected and protected. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2138.36s)]
*  But they don't say if there is, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2141.04s)]
*  if the occupation of Cyprus is an occupation. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2143.0800000000004s)]
*  What is your position? [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2146.2000000000003s)]
*  So we believe that we support a Cypriot-led [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2147.04s)]
*  UN-facilitated efforts to reunify the island [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2151.1600000000003s)]
*  as a bi-zonal, bi-communical federation [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2154.2400000000002s)]
*  with political equality to benefit all Cypriots [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2156.28s)]
*  as outlined in relevant UN Security Council resolutions. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2158.6000000000004s)]
*  That has been the longstanding policy [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2161.52s)]
*  of the United States going back years. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2162.84s)]
*  But there is an occupation, you know that. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2163.6800000000003s)]
*  Again, this is an issue we think that needs to be resolved [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2166.04s)]
*  through UN-facilitated efforts to reunify the island. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2168.28s)]
*  Thank you, so. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2172.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2173.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2174.64s)]
*  I have two questions, [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2176.3199999999997s)]
*  two plus two ministerial meeting in India. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2177.7999999999997s)]
*  After that, Vinoy Quatra, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2182.3599999999997s)]
*  Indian Foreign Ministry official, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2185.4799999999996s)]
*  re-stated of stable Bangladesh for the Indian subcontinent [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2188.4399999999996s)]
*  and raised concern over rising extremism [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2194.24s)]
*  with third country intervention. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2198.12s)]
*  What will be really danger for India as well as for USA? [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2200.88s)]
*  Will you differ from such Indian stance on Bangladesh? [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2205.6800000000003s)]
*  I just don't have any comment on that. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2210.08s)]
*  And I have the second one. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2211.6s)]
*  While US envoy repeatedly calling for dialogue [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2213.04s)]
*  between parties, ignoring the street violence [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2216.04s)]
*  between BNP Jamaat-led blockade, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2218.76s)]
*  can the US guarantee the end of such violence [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2220.92s)]
*  by BNP Jamaat given past record of such violence [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2225.44s)]
*  by same group in Bangladesh? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2228.56s)]
*  So we have consistently said that we believe elections [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2230.2s)]
*  in Bangladesh should be free and fair and open [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2232.52s)]
*  and they should take place free of violence. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2235.68s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2237.4399999999996s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2238.3599999999997s)]
*  No, no, no, no, go behind you. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2240.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2242.08s)]
*  The Biden administration has been very clear [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2242.9199999999996s)]
*  about their China strategy and the hope [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2245.2s)]
*  to stabilize relations and reopen regular lines [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2247.2799999999997s)]
*  of communication in the near term. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2250.2799999999997s)]
*  Can you speak more to what the goal and hope [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2252.56s)]
*  of this administration is for the US-China relationship [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2254.6s)]
*  in the longer term? [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2258.08s)]
*  So we have, you're right, we have the short term project [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2259.24s)]
*  which we started in June really [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2263.0s)]
*  when Secretary Blinken traveled to Beijing [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2265.4799999999996s)]
*  was to reestablish the ability to have conversations. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2267.7999999999997s)]
*  But that was not a goal in itself. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2270.9199999999996s)]
*  It was a goal so we could number one, [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2273.3199999999997s)]
*  manage big geostrategic issues and make sure [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2275.2s)]
*  that when conflicts do arise that we can talk to each other [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2277.6s)]
*  and make sure that we both avoid miscalculation. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2281.3199999999997s)]
*  But it's also was to make tangible progress [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2285.12s)]
*  on bilateral issues between the two countries. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2287.72s)]
*  You saw the secretary when he was in Beijing [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2290.2799999999997s)]
*  and then with his meetings with Wang Yi in Jakarta [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2292.64s)]
*  and his meetings with Wang Yi here just afterwards [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2295.3199999999997s)]
*  press on several tangible issues, [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2297.56s)]
*  making progress on fentanyl as one [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2299.9199999999996s)]
*  to stop the export of precursor chemicals from China [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2301.8399999999997s)]
*  that are turned into fentanyl [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2304.7599999999998s)]
*  and have killed millions and millions of America. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2305.96s)]
*  Reestablishing military to military ties is another. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2308.44s)]
*  The secretary has pressed very hard for both of those. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2311.08s)]
*  And it is that exact type of bilateral issue [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2313.48s)]
*  that we are looking to make progress on [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2316.68s)]
*  as well as an ability to work together [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2318.2s)]
*  to reduce tensions on larger strategic global issues. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2320.48s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2324.7999999999997s)]
*  No, behind, go ahead. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2325.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2327.24s)]
*  No, behind you. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2328.08s)]
*  I have a question on Russia, two questions. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2330.12s)]
*  First, if there are any contact plans [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2332.2799999999997s)]
*  between the US delegation to APEC [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2335.8399999999997s)]
*  and the Russian delegation. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2338.3199999999997s)]
*  And another question, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2340.68s)]
*  on the recent interview by Russian deputy foreign minister [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2343.08s)]
*  Sergei Volf, who said that while Russia doesn't intend [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2348.12s)]
*  to push relations between Washington and Moscow into a peace, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2352.16s)]
*  it doesn't rule out that Washington can either [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2357.3199999999997s)]
*  lower diplomatic level or break the relations. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2361.12s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2366.16s)]
*  What do you mean lower the diplomatic level or? [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2367.0s)]
*  Maybe pull out ambassador or? [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2370.68s)]
*  Oh, I don't wanna speak to that. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2376.2s)]
*  I will say with respect to the first question, [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2379.36s)]
*  there are no, I'm not aware of any meeting schedule [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2382.92s)]
*  between us and the Russian government at APEC. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2385.04s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2389.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2390.24s)]
*  Speaking of the ending destabilizing activities, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2391.08s)]
*  45 members of Congress have sent a letter [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2393.88s)]
*  to Secretary Blinken asking him to put pressure to Turkey [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2396.08s)]
*  about stopping facilitating Hamas. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2400.36s)]
*  We know your position that you have expressed it [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2402.84s)]
*  to the allies that you don't want them to support Hamas. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2404.8s)]
*  My question is, have you taken any action [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2407.44s)]
*  to ensure that a NATO member like Turkey [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2410.0s)]
*  will not support the terrorist organization [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2412.6s)]
*  that at the very right moment [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2414.32s)]
*  is attacking a major ally like Israel? [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2415.88s)]
*  Let me say two things. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2418.56s)]
*  Number one, we have made very clear our position [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2419.4s)]
*  that there can be no more business as usual with Hamas [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2421.52s)]
*  since October 7th. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2424.68s)]
*  We have long designated Hamas as a terrorist organization. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2425.68s)]
*  There are other countries that continue [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2428.32s)]
*  to conduct conversations with them [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2430.88s)]
*  and have relationships with them. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2433.04s)]
*  And we have made clear the position of the United States, [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2434.1600000000003s)]
*  which is that there shouldn't be such business [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2435.96s)]
*  as usual moving forward. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2438.6000000000004s)]
*  At the same time, we have recognized that Hamas continues [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2439.88s)]
*  to hold American citizens and citizens of Israel [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2442.88s)]
*  and citizens of Thailand and citizens [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2445.56s)]
*  of other countries as hostages. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2447.2400000000002s)]
*  And it's useful for countries that have relationships [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2449.1200000000003s)]
*  with Hamas now to use those relationships [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2451.6400000000003s)]
*  to try to get hostages released, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2454.0s)]
*  just as it's useful to use those relationships [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2455.6000000000004s)]
*  to try to get Rafa Gate reopened, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2458.7599999999998s)]
*  which we have done to get humanitarian assistance in [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2459.96s)]
*  and to flowing to get American citizens [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2462.04s)]
*  and others the ability to leave. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2466.56s)]
*  But long-term, our position is very clear [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2468.04s)]
*  that there can be no going back [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2470.12s)]
*  to the days before October 7th. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2471.2799999999997s)]
*  And Jen, and then we'll close out. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2474.2s)]
*  We're told there were migration talks [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2476.4s)]
*  between the US and Cuba here this week. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2477.88s)]
*  Is there anything you can share on that? [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2479.8s)]
*  I'll have to take that back. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2481.68s)]
*  Right, that, yeah. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2483.2s)]
*  Two widely divergent things. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2484.64s)]
*  One, just on the whole dissent issue. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2486.8s)]
*  The secretary's department-wide note, [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2491.6000000000004s)]
*  I was saying yesterday, [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2495.1600000000003s)]
*  was that written or sent out of concern [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2497.36s)]
*  that things are kind of spiraling out of control, [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2500.36s)]
*  or was it simply because it was the first workday [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2504.1600000000003s)]
*  since he got back from the trip? [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2506.84s)]
*  And what is the concern? [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2510.2000000000003s)]
*  It was sent because it's the second of two emails, [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2512.92s)]
*  the first one was sent after his first trip to the region [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2517.64s)]
*  when he came back and updated the workforce [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2519.68s)]
*  on the work that he was doing [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2522.2799999999997s)]
*  and what our policies are [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2523.2799999999997s)]
*  and what we were trying to achieve, [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2524.2799999999997s)]
*  what he was trying to achieve through his travel [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2525.48s)]
*  through the region. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2527.0s)]
*  And because this is such an important piece [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2527.8399999999997s)]
*  of diplomatic work to the department [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2530.0s)]
*  that touches not just one bureau in the department, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2531.56s)]
*  but multiple bureaus that was appropriate [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2534.4399999999996s)]
*  after the first trip to send an update [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2536.04s)]
*  and thought it was appropriate after the second trip [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2538.04s)]
*  to do the same. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2539.72s)]
*  And of course, he did address in that email [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2540.8799999999997s)]
*  all the issues underlying our policy [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2545.0s)]
*  and made clear people understood what our policy is, [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2547.24s)]
*  just as he has done in meetings he's had [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2549.12s)]
*  with a number of different employees in the department. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2550.76s)]
*  No, no, just- [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2553.04s)]
*  So there isn't, [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2553.88s)]
*  so there's not a particular concern [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2555.28s)]
*  that the unity of cohesiveness of the building [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2557.52s)]
*  is being shredded? [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2561.52s)]
*  No, as I said yesterday, [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2564.64s)]
*  we think that the diversity inside the department [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2566.0s)]
*  is actually a strength, not a weakness. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2568.04s)]
*  Okay, and it's still your understanding [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2569.64s)]
*  that there's only one person who has resigned [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2571.28s)]
*  as a result of the, in protest over the- [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2574.3199999999997s)]
*  As far as I'm aware, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2576.24s)]
*  the one resignation that's been very public [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2577.16s)]
*  is the only one that I am at least aware of, [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2579.3199999999997s)]
*  or that, with respect to our policy. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2581.8799999999997s)]
*  Okay, and then on a completely different subject, [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2584.6s)]
*  today in San Francisco, [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2587.8799999999997s)]
*  and I think it might have already happened, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2589.8399999999997s)]
*  the secretary was meeting with the Japanese [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2592.12s)]
*  and the South Korean? [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2593.8399999999997s)]
*  I think it hasn't happened, I think it's later today. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2594.8399999999997s)]
*  Oh, okay, well I'm just curious, [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2596.72s)]
*  I mean, is that just because they're there? [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2598.4s)]
*  Because he just met with them. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2599.92s)]
*  This is a conducted trilateral, [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2601.8399999999997s)]
*  he met with them separately last week, [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2603.44s)]
*  this is to conduct a trilateral meeting [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2606.04s)]
*  as a follow-on to the summit that the president held [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2608.0s)]
*  at Camp David in August. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2611.24s)]
*  And are you expecting anything to come from this, [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2613.16s)]
*  or is it just kind of like a signals check? [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2616.76s)]
*  I think we'll talk about a number of issues [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2618.28s)]
*  that are important in the relationship. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2619.88s)]
*  We may have some announcements coming out of it, [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2621.96s)]
*  stay tuned. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2623.4s)]
*  You may, absolutely. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2624.24s)]
*  You may, just stay tuned. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2625.08s)]
*  All right, thanks everyone. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2626.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmyOdxvCEU&t=2627.52s)]
