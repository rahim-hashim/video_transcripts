# Israel PM Netanyahu warns 'axis of terror' could target the US next
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg)
*  You know, I've been thinking about this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=0.0s)]
*  How many armies on the face of the earth have been trained not to kill civilians? [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=1.6400000000000001s)]
*  As a matter of fact, has our army been trained not to kill civilians? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=5.48s)]
*  I'm just curious, because I don't know how many civilians died in Afghanistan. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=10.92s)]
*  Our media wasn't keeping count of that. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=14.36s)]
*  I don't know how many civilians died in the Korean War and the Vietnam War. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=16.84s)]
*  I just don't know. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=20.2s)]
*  I don't think Churchill gave a damn about how many civilians died when he was trying [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=23.28s)]
*  to defend his country. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=26.64s)]
*  I know Franklin Roosevelt didn't give a damn, and I sure know Harry Truman didn't give a damn. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=28.48s)]
*  And so it's very strange we have a country in Israel that is the only country with a [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=33.760000000000005s)]
*  military, to my knowledge, that is trained not to kill civilians. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=39.2s)]
*  And they're up against an enemy that is trained to kill civilians, both their own Palestinians [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=44.24s)]
*  and Israelis. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=49.52s)]
*  So I sit here as an observer of the corrupt, pathetic American media, question after question, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=50.82s)]
*  right out of the box, every single time, Mr. Prime Minister, what are you going to [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=56.68s)]
*  do about the civilians? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=61.04s)]
*  So Mr. Prime Minister, I want to welcome you to the program, and I want to ask you a different [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=64.08s)]
*  question. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=68.6s)]
*  How is the war progressing, and is Israel winning? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=69.8s)]
*  The war is progressing well, and we're going to win. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=73.68s)]
*  We have no other choice. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=76.53999999999999s)]
*  It's going well because we put our forces on the ground. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=78.53999999999999s)]
*  And coincidentally, actually, there are fewer civilian casualties because we called on the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=82.0s)]
*  civilian population in Gaza to leave. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=87.08s)]
*  Hamas tried to stop them at gunpoint, actually using gunfire to prevent them from leaving [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=89.8s)]
*  the zones of battle, but they left. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=95.4s)]
*  And so the number of civilians is actually, those that are killed is going down. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=98.6s)]
*  The number of terrorists is going up. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=103.58s)]
*  We're destroying their infrastructure, their command posts, their rockets, their underground [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=105.76s)]
*  tunnels, and we're going to win because we have to win. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=110.48s)]
*  This is a battle of the forces of civilization against the forces of barbarism. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=113.24s)]
*  And if barbarism wins in our part of the world, Europe will be next and America will be next [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=118.04s)]
*  because the axis of terror, of Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and their other [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=123.92s)]
*  minions will imperil the Middle East and then spread their barbarism to the entire world. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=130.66s)]
*  Israel is fighting our war, but it's also fighting America's war. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=136.0s)]
*  It's fighting your war and our victory will be your victory. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=139.72s)]
*  You know, Mr. Prime Minister, people have very short memories. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=144.04000000000002s)]
*  We went to war in Afghanistan to fight the same Islamist ideology after our people were [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=147.96s)]
*  slaughtered in New York in the Twin Towers. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=154.16s)]
*  And we've been attacked scores of times before that by the same Islamist ideology. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=157.28s)]
*  Maybe carrying a different flag, it doesn't much matter. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=163.48s)]
*  Trying to create these caliphates all over the world, they're not really interested in [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=166.84s)]
*  having one state. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=171.44s)]
*  That's obvious with Hamas. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=172.68s)]
*  He turned over the Gaza Strip to the Palestinians and it turned into a terror state. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=173.92s)]
*  Obviously you know what's going on in Judea and Samaria now, how that area is being increasingly [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=180.6s)]
*  terrorized by the same ideology and the same individuals. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=186.78s)]
*  I just wondered, sometimes when you're by yourself and you're thinking about this and [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=191.60000000000002s)]
*  you have to talk to the press because the battle of ideas and the battle of the press [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=196.96s)]
*  goes on and on and on. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=201.28s)]
*  And Israel's been through this many times. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=203.32000000000002s)]
*  At the very beginning Israel supported and then so much of the world turns on Israel. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=205.04000000000002s)]
*  Sometimes do you say to yourself, what the hell is going on in this world? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=210.52s)]
*  It's turned inside out. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=214.68s)]
*  Don't the Western democracies give a damn about what's taking place here? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=216.04000000000002s)]
*  I think a lot of people do and in America there's a strong backing of public opinion [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=219.92s)]
*  that basically understands that Israel is on the forces of good against the forces of [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=225.16s)]
*  evil and I saw this massive rally a few days ago in Washington of Jews and non-Jews standing [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=229.36s)]
*  together shoulder to shoulder because they understand that. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=235.64s)]
*  But yes, there is that certain frustration because we're attacked by Hamas. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=238.76s)]
*  They storm into our communities, rape and murder women, burn babies, behead people, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=244.08s)]
*  take hostages, babies, children, elderly, murder children in front of their parents, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=254.44s)]
*  parents in front of their children. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=260.28000000000003s)]
*  No wonder the German Chancellor came here and he said, these are the new Nazis. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=262.36s)]
*  So what did you do with the original Nazis? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=268.36s)]
*  Hitler invades Europe, commits the worst savagery. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=271.16s)]
*  He does the Holocaust on the Jews. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=277.52s)]
*  The Allies fight back. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=280.0s)]
*  They invade Normandy. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=281.24s)]
*  They go through the cities of France and the cities of Germany. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=283.08s)]
*  The German army places itself in the cities, in civilian neighborhoods, in hospitals, in [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=286.6s)]
*  schools everywhere. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=291.12s)]
*  And of course the Allies fight. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=293.64s)]
*  They target the German army. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=295.6s)]
*  But there are also civilian casualties. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=298.04s)]
*  A lot of them. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=299.44s)]
*  Now, you know, what would have happened to history if at that point public opinion would [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=300.44s)]
*  say in the democracies, oh God, what are you doing to the Nazis? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=305.84s)]
*  What are you doing to the German population? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=311.08s)]
*  That's not what they asked. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=313.04s)]
*  They said what you said. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=314.76s)]
*  How is the war progressing? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=316.44s)]
*  History would have been catastrophic if we didn't keep our eye focused on who's to blame. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=318.0s)]
*  Who was to blame? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=324.2s)]
*  Who was to blame for these civilian casualties? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=326.12s)]
*  The Allies or the Nazis? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=328.22s)]
*  And now many, many in many quarters in the democracies, they're saying Israel is to blame. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=330.22s)]
*  The Allies are to blame. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=336.34000000000003s)]
*  Not the axis of terror, but the Allies for peace and for prosperity and for modernity [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=337.78000000000003s)]
*  against these barbarians who want to take us back to the Middle Ages, early Middle Ages, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=343.90000000000003s)]
*  may I say. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=348.06s)]
*  So we have to, this is a sign of moral bankruptcy. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=349.06s)]
*  It's a sign of moral obfuscation. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=352.26000000000005s)]
*  It's a sign of deep confusion at best. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=354.48s)]
*  And we have to get the simple things straight. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=357.02s)]
*  While Israel is keeping, doing everything in its power to keep civilians out of harm's [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=360.9s)]
*  way, Hamas is doing everything in its power to keep civilians in harm's way. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=365.97999999999996s)]
*  Israel provides humanitarian safe zones, humanitarian quarters. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=370.9s)]
*  Hamas prevents Gaza civilians from leaving the war zones. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=374.82s)]
*  So it's not Hamas, it's not Israel, but Hamas that is responsible for what it's doing. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=380.12s)]
*  It's using the civilian population as human shields. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=386.34s)]
*  It is deliberately targeting and murdering civilians and deliberately hiding behind civilians. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=389.82s)]
*  That's a double war crime. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=396.14s)]
*  They're the ones responsible. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=397.64s)]
*  They should be held blamed and they should be held accountable, not Israel. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=399.09999999999997s)]
*  Israel is fighting the just war, the right war of the democracies against the barbarians. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=402.9s)]
*  You've spent most of your life as prime minister, as a cabinet member, as a party leader, as [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=407.73999999999995s)]
*  a scholar, warning about the terrorists, warning about the ideology, warning about [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=415.98s)]
*  Iran. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=422.42s)]
*  It came to really a pinnacle when you came to the United States during the Obama administration [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=423.42s)]
*  and spoke to the entire Congress, the entire world, every American. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=429.26s)]
*  And you said Iran must not get a nuclear weapon. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=433.98s)]
*  It seems to me if you're concerned about citizens, innocent people, about babies in [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=440.46s)]
*  hospitals, you're concerned about all those things, which we are, then you will do everything [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=447.18s)]
*  humanly possible to ensure that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=452.85999999999996s)]
*  So my question to you, sir, is this. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=456.26s)]
*  To the best of your knowledge, what exactly is being done to try and prevent Iran from [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=459.41999999999996s)]
*  getting a nuclear weapon, to your knowledge? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=465.21999999999997s)]
*  I'm not going to say everything in my knowledge, but I can say this, Mark, that the jury is [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=467.46s)]
*  still out. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=471.73999999999995s)]
*  I mean, if we see what the Iranian axis is doing without nuclear weapons, the horrors [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=472.73999999999995s)]
*  it perpetrated on that October 7th, the wanton terrorism that is practicing not only in the [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=478.97999999999996s)]
*  Middle East, but in every continent around the world, including in North America and [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=486.26s)]
*  in South America, the terrible aggression that is perpetrating in every single zone [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=489.62s)]
*  in the world and especially in our region. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=497.18s)]
*  That's what it's doing without nuclear weapons. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=500.86s)]
*  Now imagine what would happen if Iran had nuclear weapons and all its minions, all its [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=502.82s)]
*  proxies would know that they have a nuclear umbrella. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=507.66s)]
*  It would be a different world and the entire world would be endangered. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=510.78000000000003s)]
*  And of course, if Iran had nuclear weapons, they'd be able to use not only terrorist proxies, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=514.26s)]
*  they'd be able to wield on you the threat of the greatest terror of them all, nuclear [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=519.0600000000001s)]
*  terrorism. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=525.62s)]
*  It have ballistic missiles that could reach any city in the United States and they'll [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=526.78s)]
*  hold you hostage. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=530.78s)]
*  And therefore the battle now that we're waging is a battle against Iran's axis of terror. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=532.86s)]
*  And everybody wants to see who's going to win. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=538.5799999999999s)]
*  If Israel wins, we all win. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=541.62s)]
*  And if Israel doesn't win, then the axis emerges victorious and that imperils our entire future. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=544.0799999999999s)]
*  So this is not just Israel's war, it's your war. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=551.4399999999999s)]
*  And we have to win this war. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=554.9399999999999s)]
*  In ISIS, we had to win the battle against the Nazis. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=556.7s)]
*  We had to win the battle against ISIS. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=558.94s)]
*  We had to win the battle against Al-Qaeda. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=560.98s)]
*  Everybody united, they understood. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=563.38s)]
*  We cannot let this be obfuscated by Hamas propaganda and media obfuscation. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=565.0600000000001s)]
*  We have to keep our moral clarity and our strategic clarity. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=569.9000000000001s)]
*  We have to understand that we're fighting for our future. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=573.9000000000001s)]
*  By the way, the future of the Palestinians as well as Israelis, the future of the Middle [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=577.14s)]
*  East, the future of the moderate Arab states, the future of the expansion of the historic [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=581.46s)]
*  Abraham Accords, a future of peace with Saudi Arabia, that can all be achieved. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=585.94s)]
*  But it has one necessary prerequisite, victory, total victory over Hamas. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=591.1s)]
*  We destroy Hamas, we assure the peace. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=597.58s)]
*  We destroy Hamas, we assure security. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=600.1800000000001s)]
*  We destroy Hamas, we assure a better future for all. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=602.5400000000001s)]
*  And honestly, this is what statesmen and real leaders, especially at wartime, believe. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=606.0s)]
*  Lincoln, Churchill, Washington, many of your greatest leaders in the past, and Israel and [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=610.94s)]
*  so forth, when you're at war, and a war like this is a war to the end, there's a [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=619.3000000000001s)]
*  winner and there's a loser. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=624.2600000000001s)]
*  And I'm just concerned people don't understand that. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmDMdC6oGkg&t=626.7800000000001s)]
