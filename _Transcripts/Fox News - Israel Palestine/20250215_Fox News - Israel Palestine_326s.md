# Israel is ‘grateful’ for President Trump, ambassador to the UN says
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [February 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU)
*  Joining us now, Israeli Ambassador to the U.N., Danny Danon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, it is always a pleasure to have you with us. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=4.84s)]
*  We thank you for your time. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=7.32s)]
*  What do you believe the Security Cabinet will decide when it meets in just about—just [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=9.24s)]
*  under two hours' time? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=15.4s)]
*  Will all hell break loose, as President Trump has said it should, given that all the hostages [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=17.48s)]
*  have not been released today? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=22.56s)]
*  Or will Prime Minister Netanyahu continue on this path with this fragile ceasefire holding? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=24.56s)]
*  Good morning, Jonathan, and thank you for having me. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=32.08s)]
*  Yes, indeed, you know, we are very happy to see three hostages coming back to their families. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=34.36s)]
*  We are praying for the release of the rest of the hostages, and we are determined to [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=40.239999999999995s)]
*  bring all of them back. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=43.599999999999994s)]
*  We have to be grateful for President Trump, because only a few days ago Hamas said they [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=45.64s)]
*  the three hostages, and they will violate the agreement, the framework we have with [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=50.92s)]
*  them. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  So I think the pressure that the president put on the table helped to release those hostages. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=56.120000000000005s)]
*  The Cabinet will meet in two hours, and we'll discuss the next steps. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=62.44s)]
*  You know, we do have a framework with Hamas. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  We are not happy about the framework, but we accepted it. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=68.6s)]
*  Basically, we know that we released murderers, convicted murderers, in order to receive the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=72.16s)]
*  hostages, and there are still a few more weeks ahead of us that we can bring back home the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=76.8s)]
*  hostages. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=81.88s)]
*  So Prime Minister Netanyahu, we'll lead the discussion at noon US time, and we'll have [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=82.88s)]
*  to think about all options. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=88.8s)]
*  But I think Hamas understands today that we have no patience for any games, or if they [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=90.36s)]
*  will breach the agreement, we will resume our military activity. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=95.64s)]
*  So it sounds from what you are saying, Mr Ambassador, that all hell will not break loose, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=100.0s)]
*  as President Trump had suggested it should, if Hamas keeps releasing the hostages on the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=107.24s)]
*  current schedule. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=115.2s)]
*  So we should not expect all-out war to be resumed in the next 24 hours, for instance. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=116.4s)]
*  So Jonathan, we are preparing for all options. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=122.0s)]
*  You know, the military is ready, is capable. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=124.6s)]
*  But at the same time, you know, we worked hard, and the US supported these efforts to [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=127.92s)]
*  achieve this framework. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=133.4s)]
*  It wasn't easy for the government to approve this framework, but I think that will be the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=135.4s)]
*  decision in front of the Cabinet, whether to move ahead with the proposal coming from [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=139.56s)]
*  the US, or to move forward with the framework, and to get as many hostages as we can alive. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=144.52s)]
*  Mr Ambassador, we look at the extraordinary pictures on our screen right now of the families [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=152.92s)]
*  being reunited. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=160.48s)]
*  They bring us joy. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=162.04s)]
*  I think they bring joy to every reasonable person in the world every time we see those. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=163.04s)]
*  But the juxtaposition to that is the release itself, when we see those hostages led to [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=167.23999999999998s)]
*  by dozens, if not hundreds, of Hamas fighters. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=176.68s)]
*  It is impossible for Prime Minister Netanyahu to argue that he has achieved his goal of [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=181.96s)]
*  destroying Hamas. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=188.32s)]
*  There are hundreds of them every time we see these hostages released, wearing masks, carrying [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=190.56s)]
*  rifles. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=197.24s)]
*  Hamas is not destroyed by any means, it appears. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=198.24s)]
*  I agree with you, Jonathan. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=201.04000000000002s)]
*  We have to finish the job. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=202.8s)]
*  We cannot allow Hamas to regroup, to recruit more terrorists, and to attack us again. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=204.32s)]
*  And I think we are not worried about those pictures of a few hundred militants or terrorists, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=210.64s)]
*  but indeed we know that Hamas is still in power in Gaza, and that's why we are determined [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=215.95999999999998s)]
*  to make sure that at the end of this war Hamas will not be there. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=221.51999999999998s)]
*  So they have to choose whether they want to move out by themselves to be exiled, or they [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=224.84s)]
*  want to wait for us to come and hunt them down. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=231.07999999999998s)]
*  But we will make sure that Hamas will not stay in power in Gaza. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=233.52s)]
*  We are determined about it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=237.76000000000002s)]
*  And Mr Ambassador, finally, if I can talk to you a little bit about what President Trump [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=239.8s)]
*  has said about the future of Gaza, that the U.S. would take control of it, all Palestinians [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=244.84s)]
*  essentially would be moved out to Jordan and Egypt. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=250.14000000000001s)]
*  That sounds to some people like what the president might be ultimately trying to do is to hand [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=254.84s)]
*  Gaza to Israel, to increase Israel's territory. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=262.92s)]
*  Is that a fair reading of it? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=267.68s)]
*  No, absolutely not. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=269.48s)]
*  I beg to differ with you on that. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=270.48s)]
*  We have no intention to go back to Gaza. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=273.0s)]
*  We left Gaza in 2005, 20 years ago, and we are not intending to go back there. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=275.64000000000004s)]
*  And I think the president is right. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=282.88000000000005s)]
*  It is about time to think about new ideas. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=283.88000000000005s)]
*  So many leaders speak about the Palestinian cause, but they are not offering any ideas. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=287.12s)]
*  So I think it is about time to think about new ideas. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=292.44s)]
*  And countries in the region should support the process of helping the Palestinians. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=294.91999999999996s)]
*  So I think it is a good direction of the president. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=299.96s)]
*  It will not be easy to implement, but I think now is the time for new ideas. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=302.56s)]
*  Mr Ambassador, it is always such a pleasure to talk to you. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=308.36s)]
*  Thank you so much for spending part of your Saturday with us, sir. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=311.59999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=314.2s)]
*  Thank you, Jonathan. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1Kgv2pnlU&t=315.2s)]
