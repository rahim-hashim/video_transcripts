# Trey Yingst opens up about his embed into southern Lebanon
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZhU_21gjsY)
*  We're talking tensions running high, of course, in the Middle East after Iran's bombardment [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZhU_21gjsY&t=0.0s)]
*  of Israel yesterday. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZhU_21gjsY&t=4.4s)]
*  Trey Yanks, recently embedded with the IDF as units moved across the border into southern [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZhU_21gjsY&t=5.8s)]
*  Lebanon. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZhU_21gjsY&t=10.56s)]
*  Trey is the first journalist to go into the country with the IDF since the conflict erupted [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZhU_21gjsY&t=11.56s)]
*  between the two sides. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZhU_21gjsY&t=16.02s)]
*  He joins us now from the northern city of Haifa, Israel, with an exclusive look. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZhU_21gjsY&t=17.54s)]
*  Also looking back, we saw you yesterday, just before this time of day, Trey, at your hotel [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZhU_21gjsY&t=22.52s)]
*  as those missiles were incoming, sort of looked like right over your head. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZhU_21gjsY&t=28.16s)]
*  Yeah, Jillian, good afternoon. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZhU_21gjsY&t=35.0s)]
*  As Israeli forces launched a ground operation into southern Lebanon this week, we were among [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZhU_21gjsY&t=36.6s)]
*  the first groups of soldiers to enter. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZhU_21gjsY&t=42.2s)]
*  Here's a look at a Hezbollah position dug into the side of a mountain. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZhU_21gjsY&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  Right now, Israeli forces are conducting a ground invasion into southern Lebanon. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZhU_21gjsY&t=51.0s)]
*  We're embedded with an elite commando unit that just arrived at this Hezbollah position, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZhU_21gjsY&t=57.76s)]
*  carved into the side of a mountain. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZhU_21gjsY&t=62.4s)]
*  It's in tunnels and rooms like this, the Israelis say they are finding Iranian weapons that [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZhU_21gjsY&t=64.92s)]
*  were smuggled first to Syria and then into southern Lebanon. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZhU_21gjsY&t=69.52s)]
*  To get to this Hezbollah position, we had to cross minefields and hike across an uneven [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZhU_21gjsY&t=73.96s)]
*  terrain pocked with craters, a result of the Israeli bombardment of southern Lebanon. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZhU_21gjsY&t=80.12s)]
*  All of this began on October 8th, when Hezbollah followed Hamas and started attacking northern [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZhU_21gjsY&t=86.96s)]
*  Israel in the hours after the October 7th massacre. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZhU_21gjsY&t=93.72s)]
*  Now Israel says they are conducting these limited raids across the border to destroy [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZhU_21gjsY&t=100.08s)]
*  these Hezbollah positions and allow Israeli civilians to return to their homes in the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZhU_21gjsY&t=105.52s)]
*  northern part of the country. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZhU_21gjsY&t=111.0s)]
*  The Israeli ground and air campaign against southern Lebanon continues today. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZhU_21gjsY&t=114.88s)]
*  We know that hundreds of Hezbollah fighters have been killed in the process, along with [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZhU_21gjsY&t=120.1s)]
*  hundreds of civilians. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZhU_21gjsY&t=124.14s)]
*  While we follow this developing story, we can also report at this hour that eight Israeli [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZhU_21gjsY&t=126.06s)]
*  soldiers were killed earlier today in battles with Hezbollah. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZhU_21gjsY&t=131.1s)]
*  Jillian? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZhU_21gjsY&t=134.8s)]
*  Trey, thank you for that coverage. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZhU_21gjsY&t=135.8s)]
*  Thank you for staying up late to be with us and for your pretty much continuous coverage [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZhU_21gjsY&t=138.68s)]
