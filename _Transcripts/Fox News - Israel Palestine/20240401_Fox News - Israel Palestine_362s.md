# Mike Pompeo: Biden is in a political fight for his life
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do)
*  Welcome back to Sunday Night in America. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=0.0s)]
*  The rift between the Biden administration and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=2.38s)]
*  seems to be growing. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=6.86s)]
*  The U.S. abstained from a U.N. vote, calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, so the resolution [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=8.96s)]
*  passed. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Yes, Russia and China voted to lecture Israel on aggression and civilian casualties. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  Netanyahu canceled an Israeli delegation visit to Washington shortly thereafter. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=20.96s)]
*  White House spokesperson John Kirby said the U.S. vote, or lack thereof, does not represent [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=26.2s)]
*  a shift in supporting Israel, but it sure does seem like it, doesn't it? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=31.48s)]
*  Joining us is former Secretary of State and Fox News contributor Mike Pompeo. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=35.64s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, welcome. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=40.04s)]
*  It's so nice to see you again. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=41.04s)]
*  So Russia and China vote for a ceasefire with Israel, and the U.S. sits on its hands. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  How is that not a shift in U.S. policy towards Israel? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=48.84s)]
*  Well, Trey, it's great to be with you on this special day. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=53.36s)]
*  We're talking about Israel, right, the place where these events transpired on this special [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=56.12s)]
*  day. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=60.8s)]
*  And what the United States did by allowing that resolution to pass was we rewarded Hamas, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=61.8s)]
*  we rewarded the terrorists, what they did on October 7th. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=66.28s)]
*  And so the Iranians, the Russians and the Chinese are happy, and our Israeli partners [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=69.32s)]
*  are under even more difficult circumstances than they were before. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  This was a major event. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=77.42s)]
*  I don't know why the Biden administration let this happen. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=78.68s)]
*  Maybe it's U.S. domestic politics. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=81.44000000000001s)]
*  I hope it's not the case. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=83.0s)]
*  It sure looks like it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=84.0s)]
*  But make no mistake about it, Israel now recognizes that their friend, their ally, their long-term [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=85.72s)]
*  committed partner is not going to stand with them in the way that they need to in this [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=89.96000000000001s)]
*  true time of crisis. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  You know, Mr. Secretary, you put your finger on the question. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=98.0s)]
*  I think most people are asking, which is the question of why? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=100.84s)]
*  I mean, it's been six months, only six months, since Hamas invaded Israel and killed scores [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=104.0s)]
*  of innocent civilians, including women and children. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=109.6s)]
*  So what is the statute of limitations on a country defending itself against a terrorist [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=112.44s)]
*  group? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=116.92s)]
*  The U.S. spends decades doing it, and apparently six months is all Israel gets? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=117.92s)]
*  It's a truly remarkable trade to watch the Biden administration, who was frankly really [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=124.11999999999999s)]
*  good in the opening days, October 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, but in the meantime has now come [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=127.75999999999999s)]
*  to listen to this pro-Hamas wing of their own political party where they're, you know, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=133.35999999999999s)]
*  the president's going to events. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=137.76s)]
*  He's hearing from protesters. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=139.0s)]
*  But instead of articulating why it matters to Americans, why having an ally and a partner [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=140.51999999999998s)]
*  like Israel matters to the lives of every single American, why it's the right thing [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=145.48s)]
*  to do, he simply begins to cave in ways that will undermine American security. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=149.0s)]
*  Your point about six months is well taken. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=154.28s)]
*  You know, the storyline has become that the Israelis are somehow behaving in a way that [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=156.92s)]
*  is immoral. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=160.84s)]
*  Nothing could be further from the truth. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=161.84s)]
*  You and I know how the Americans fight. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=163.76s)]
*  We know how the Israelis fight. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=165.76s)]
*  They're doing everything they can to protect these civilians, and it is Iran and Hamas [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=167.04s)]
*  that are putting these civilian lives at risk. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=171.0s)]
*  I can't explain why the Biden administration has so quickly caved to this minority wing [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=173.48s)]
*  of their party. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=178.84s)]
*  Maybe, Trey, it's because it's not that small inside their party. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=179.84s)]
*  Maybe it's a larger bloc than you and I might otherwise think it is. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=182.76s)]
*  To that point, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called for a regime change in Israel, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=187.79999999999998s)]
*  defending him after he did it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=193.92s)]
*  Some House members are frankly openly pro-Hamas. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=196.44s)]
*  So it's either pure politics seeking favor with young voters or there's something else [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=200.11999999999998s)]
*  going on that I can't see. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=205.39999999999998s)]
*  You're the one that graduated, number one, at West Point. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  Is it politics or something else going on? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=211.27999999999997s)]
*  You know, I do think this is about U.S. domestic politics. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=214.2s)]
*  It can't be about security, because we know Israel is going to do the right thing and [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=219.72s)]
*  defend its own sovereignty. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=223.70000000000002s)]
*  It's going to take care of Hamas. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=225.12s)]
*  It's going to do the hard work to defend itself against Hezbollah in the North as well. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=226.48000000000002s)]
*  So it's not about strategy or security. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=230.68s)]
*  And that leaves only President Biden, who's in a political fight for his life, and so [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=232.96s)]
*  thinks these are some votes that he needs to get, and so is caving to this truly anti-Semitic [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=236.94s)]
*  component of his party that doesn't understand the deep commitment that the United States [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=244.08s)]
*  has had, a bipartisan commitment for decades, Trey, as you know from your time in Congress, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=249.12s)]
*  a bipartisan commitment to understanding the Middle East in a way that preserves what America [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=253.04s)]
*  needs. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=258.24s)]
*  They've walked away from it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=259.24s)]
*  It looks like it's the worst of domestic politics impacting American security, and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=260.24s)]
*  I hope the Biden administration will learn to rise above it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=264.0s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, the war in the Middle East has diverted attention away from Eastern Europe. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=269.56s)]
*  the state of war there, and will the U.S. continue to provide aid or loans or whatever [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=275.4s)]
*  you want to call it to Ukraine? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=281.35999999999996s)]
*  Trey, I still remain optimistic. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=283.35999999999996s)]
*  I've said from the beginning now, two and a half years on, that the United States has [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=287.2s)]
*  a deep interest for itself. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=291.0s)]
*  To put America first requires us to do the right thing for Europe, to help Europe defend [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=292.67999999999995s)]
*  itself. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=297.96s)]
*  We need the Europeans to do more. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=298.96s)]
*  I'm convinced that we will continue to do that. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  The Ukrainians continue to fight hard. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=303.32s)]
*  It is a very difficult fight there, but they need Western support. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=305.2s)]
*  They need Germany. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=308.84s)]
*  They need France. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=309.84s)]
*  They need the United States. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=310.84s)]
*  They need all of us continuing to provide them with simply the resources. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=311.84s)]
*  They haven't asked for our young boys and girls. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=315.44s)]
*  They've simply asked for stuff. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=317.11999999999995s)]
*  We ought to provide that to them. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=318.96s)]
*  If it's in the form of a loan so that when Ukraine gets back on its feet, they can repay [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=320.35999999999996s)]
*  us, so much the better. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=323.96s)]
*  Mike Pompeo, truly one of the more remarkable resumes of anyone I know. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=328.08s)]
*  If you go through it from college all the way to now he's in the private sector. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=333.4s)]
*  I personally hope he stays in the private sector, and these rumors of going back to [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=337.47999999999996s)]
*  government aren't true, but that's just my selfishness. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=341.4s)]
*  Happy Easter to you, Mr. Secretary. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=346.12s)]
*  I hope I see you soon. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=347.59999999999997s)]
*  Happy Easter, Trey. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=348.88s)]
*  Bless you. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc5bNXV57do&t=349.88s)]
