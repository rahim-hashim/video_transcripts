# Kamala Harris: Israel has ‘right to defend itself,’ ‘serious concern’ over suffering in Gaza
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [July 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE)
*  Here is Vice President Kamala Harris. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=0.0s)]
*  So I just had a frank and constructive meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=5.2s)]
*  I told him that I will always ensure that Israel is able to defend itself, including [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=8.92s)]
*  from Iran and Iran-backed militias such as Hamas and Hezbollah. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=15.0s)]
*  From when I was a young girl collecting funds to plant trees for Israel to my time in the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  United States Senate and now at the White House, I have had an unwavering commitment [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=27.159999999999997s)]
*  to the existence of the State of Israel, to its security, and to the people of Israel. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=32.68s)]
*  I've said it many times, but it bears repeating. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=38.4s)]
*  Israel has a right to defend itself. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  And how it does so matters. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=46.16s)]
*  Hamas is a brutal terrorist organization. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=49.599999999999994s)]
*  On October 7, Hamas triggered this war when it massacred 1,200 innocent people, including [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  44 Americans. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=60.52s)]
*  Hamas has committed horrific acts of sexual violence and took 250 hostages. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=62.84s)]
*  There are American citizens who remain captive in Gaza. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=70.52000000000001s)]
*  And the remains of American citizens, Judy Weinstein, Gad Hagai, and Itai Hen, are still [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=75.2s)]
*  being held in Gaza. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=97.44s)]
*  I have met with the families of these American hostages multiple times now, and I've told [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=100.08000000000001s)]
*  them each time they are not alone and I stand with them. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=106.12s)]
*  And President Biden and I are working every day to bring them home. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=111.68s)]
*  I also expressed with the Prime Minister my serious concern about the scale of human suffering [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=117.56s)]
*  in Gaza, including the death of far too many innocent civilians. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=124.34s)]
*  And I made clear my serious concern about the dire humanitarian situation there, with [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=131.1s)]
*  over 2 million people facing high levels of food insecurity and half a million people [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=137.86s)]
*  facing catastrophic levels of acute food insecurity. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=145.3s)]
*  What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=151.14s)]
*  The images of dead children and desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=155.98s)]
*  displaced for the second, third or fourth time. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=163.6s)]
*  We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=168.64s)]
*  We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=172.14s)]
*  And I will not be silent. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=176.82s)]
*  In place to the leadership of our President Joe Biden, there is a deal on the table for [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=180.66s)]
*  a ceasefire and a hostage deal. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=184.66s)]
*  And it is important that we recall what the deal involves. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=188.02s)]
*  The first phase of the deal would bring about a full ceasefire, including a withdrawal of [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=192.66s)]
*  the Israeli military from population centers in Gaza. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=198.58s)]
*  In the second phase, the Israeli military would withdraw from Gaza entirely, and it [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=203.32s)]
*  would lead to a permanent end to the hostilities. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=209.34s)]
*  It is time for this war to end, and end in a way where Israel is secure, all the hostages [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=214.14000000000001s)]
*  are released, the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=221.68s)]
*  exercise their right to freedom, dignity and self-determination. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=229.18s)]
*  There has been hopeful movement in the talks to secure an agreement on this deal. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=235.78s)]
*  And as I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=241.4s)]
*  So to everyone who has been calling for a ceasefire, and to everyone who yearns for [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=247.6s)]
*  peace, I see you and I hear you. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=253.1s)]
*  Let's get the deal done so we can get a ceasefire to end the war. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=258.02s)]
*  Let's bring the hostages home, and let's provide much needed relief to the Palestinian [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=263.2s)]
*  people. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=269.3s)]
*  And ultimately, I remain committed to a path forward that can lead to a two-state solution. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=271.24s)]
*  And I know right now it is hard to conceive of that prospect, but a two-state solution [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=279.15999999999997s)]
*  is the only path that ensures Israel remains a secure Jewish and democratic state, and [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=285.6s)]
*  one that ensures Palestinians can finally realize the freedom, security and prosperity [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=293.32000000000005s)]
*  that they rightly deserve. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=299.58000000000004s)]
*  And I will close with this then. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=302.8s)]
*  It is important for the American people to remember, the war in Gaza is not a binary [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=305.32000000000005s)]
*  issue. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=310.72s)]
*  However too often the conversation is binary, when the reality is anything but. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=312.44000000000005s)]
*  So I ask my fellow Americans to help encourage efforts to acknowledge the complexity, the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=319.72s)]
*  nuance and the history of the region. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=326.68s)]
*  Let us all condemn terrorism and violence. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=330.68s)]
*  Let us all do what we can to prevent the suffering of innocent civilians. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=334.6s)]
*  And let us condemn anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and hate of any kind. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=340.5s)]
*  And let us work to unite our country. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=348.66s)]
*  I thank you. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEacqxAGTHE&t=351.78s)]
