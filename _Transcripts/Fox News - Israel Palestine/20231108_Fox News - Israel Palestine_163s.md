# 'MEDICAL DISASTER': Gaza hospitals face catastrophic situation
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df5xZKzJqQ4)
*  in focus House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCall. We begin with Fox News [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df5xZKzJqQ4&t=0.0s)]
*  war correspondent Trey Yanks and Israel Trey Harris. Good morning. The challenge [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df5xZKzJqQ4&t=5.08s)]
*  for the Israeli military right now is they have Gaza City surrounded, but [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df5xZKzJqQ4&t=11.88s)]
*  there are still thousands of Palestinian civilians amid the battlefield. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df5xZKzJqQ4&t=15.64s)]
*  So they've opened up a new humanitarian corridor to get some of those civilians [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df5xZKzJqQ4&t=19.18s)]
*  south. But the medical facilities across Gaza are starting to collapse despite [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df5xZKzJqQ4&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  the fact that aid is now flowing in in part to the strip. Take a look. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df5xZKzJqQ4&t=27.72s)]
*  Hospitals in Gaza, like the R. R. T. C. Are overflowing with patients damaged by [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df5xZKzJqQ4&t=33.36s)]
*  airstrikes and limited in supplies. Some are on the brink of collapse. We're [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df5xZKzJqQ4&t=39.12s)]
*  experiencing a medical disaster. All the medical supplies have run out. All the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df5xZKzJqQ4&t=45.4s)]
*  medicine for cancer patients has run out. The hospital's director Bakar Daur [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df5xZKzJqQ4&t=49.68s)]
*  explains. We are heading towards a catastrophe. The Israeli military says [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df5xZKzJqQ4&t=54.44s)]
*  665 aid trucks have entered Gaza since the war began over a month ago. On [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df5xZKzJqQ4&t=59.36s)]
*  those trucks was food, water and medical equipment. What did the managers of the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df5xZKzJqQ4&t=65.12s)]
*  hospital say that they need? We've been talking with medical facilities in Gaza [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df5xZKzJqQ4&t=69.44s)]
*  and they say they're running out of basic supplies to treat wounded patients. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df5xZKzJqQ4&t=73.08s)]
*  Well, I think that they are also in a very difficult situation because they [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df5xZKzJqQ4&t=77.44s)]
*  are trapped between this situation and Hamas. I know that Hamas took over on [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df5xZKzJqQ4&t=82.04s)]
*  their fuel supply. I know that Hamas runs basically the way that they are [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df5xZKzJqQ4&t=90.44s)]
*  getting the medical supplies. The United Nations that coordinates with Israel on [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df5xZKzJqQ4&t=97.56s)]
*  aid deliveries says the aid entering Gaza is not enough to support the more [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df5xZKzJqQ4&t=102.52000000000001s)]
*  than 2 million Palestinians living there. The Israelis point to Hamas [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df5xZKzJqQ4&t=106.80000000000001s)]
*  taking resources in the past that were meant for the Gazan people and said [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df5xZKzJqQ4&t=111.0s)]
*  that despite the situation, there's no humanitarian crisis in Gaza. We know [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df5xZKzJqQ4&t=114.96s)]
*  and I can say for sure there is no humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Of course, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df5xZKzJqQ4&t=120.32s)]
*  the situation is not easy. I would push back on that. Sorry, you would say [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df5xZKzJqQ4&t=125.36s)]
*  there's no humanitarian crisis in Gaza. I am saying once again, there is no [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df5xZKzJqQ4&t=129.68s)]
*  humanitarian crisis in Gaza. I know the situation is not easy, but we are in a [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df5xZKzJqQ4&t=134.44s)]
*  war. We didn't put, we didn't pick and choose to enter this war. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df5xZKzJqQ4&t=140.28s)]
*  There absolutely is a humanitarian crisis inside Gaza. The challenge, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df5xZKzJqQ4&t=147.4s)]
*  though, Harris, is the fact that the 2 million Palestinian civilians living [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df5xZKzJqQ4&t=150.96s)]
*  there are ruled by Hamas, a group that is now fighting a war against Israel [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df5xZKzJqQ4&t=154.96s)]
*  from civilian areas. Harris. Trey Yanks, thank you very much. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df5xZKzJqQ4&t=158.96s)]
