**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU)
*  So the US is finally retaliating for more than 100 attacks by Iran proxies on our forces [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=0.0s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=6.92s)]
*  It's been going on since October. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=8.2s)]
*  Three service members injured in Iraq on Christmas Day in the latest attack. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  Then hours later, the US struck three facilities used by Hezbollah terrorists. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=14.4s)]
*  Early assessments say a number of Hezbollah fighters were likely killed. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  GOP Congressman Cory Mills of the Foreign Affairs and Armed Services Committee says [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=24.2s)]
*  that this is about the global implications. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=29.52s)]
*  You have Hamas, which is an Iran-backed militia who has continued to move forward [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=33.44s)]
*  doing genocide and barbaric attacks on the people of Israel. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=38.04s)]
*  Now you've got where the Iran-backed Houthis are starting to take attacks on the shipping lanes [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=41.84s)]
*  and also looking at maritime and commerce distractions. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=47.28s)]
*  Then you fast forward into Iraq again. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=51.32s)]
*  We have to understand that that geopolitical alignment of China, Russia, Iran and North Korea [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  need to be a broader topic for us to be discussing, not looking at attacks as singular areas. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=59.28s)]
*  A smoke rising over Gaza today, meanwhile, as Israel continues its offensive against Hamas terrorists. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=65.92s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu resisting calls for a ceasefire yet again [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=72.28s)]
*  and outlining his conditions for any deal in a Wall Street Journal op-ed. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=77.44s)]
*  They are destroying Hamas, demilitarizing Gaza and deradicalizing Palestinian society. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=82.48s)]
*  Trey Yngst in Tel Aviv with the very latest. Hey Trey. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=89.52000000000001s)]
*  Hey Julie, a lot of developments here. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=94.16000000000001s)]
*  Overnight, President Biden ordered the U.S. military to strike a series of targets [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=95.84s)]
*  belonging to an Iran-backed Iraqi Shia militia. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  According to CENTCOM, three strikes destroyed the targeted facilities [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=104.64000000000001s)]
*  and likely killed a number of Khatai Hezbollah militants. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  The airstrikes came in response to a drone attack against the Erbil air base [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=112.16s)]
*  that houses U.S. service members. Three Americans were injured in that attack, one critically. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=116.08s)]
*  This does bring the total of attacks against American interests in the Middle East [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=120.8s)]
*  to 103 since mid-October. It also comes as Israeli forces remain on high alert [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=124.64s)]
*  after an airstrike yesterday in Syria killed IRGC commander Said Razit Mousavi. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=130.16s)]
*  In response to that strike, Iranian President Ibrahim Raisi said, quote, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=135.76s)]
*  This act is a sign of the Zionist regime's frustration and weakness in the region, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=139.92s)]
*  for which it will certainly pay the price. Now we do know there have been more attacks [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  into northern Israel today against different positions belonging to both civilians and soldiers. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  Coming from the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=154.72s)]
*  Ilan Levy, a spokesperson for the Israeli government, saying this about the situation. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=157.2s)]
*  The anti-tank missile attack just recently on the St. Mary's Greek Orthodox Church in Ikrit, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=162.95999999999998s)]
*  injuring a civilian in Israel, is a reminder that for Hezbollah and its Iranian puppet masters, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=169.44s)]
*  nothing is sacred. There is no going back. Either Hezbollah retreats as part of an effective [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=175.76s)]
*  diplomatic solution, our preferred option, or we will push it back ourselves using military force. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=183.28s)]
*  Real concern in the region about the possibility of a broader war with Iran. Julie? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=192.0s)]
*  Trey Yankst, thank you so much. Reporting live in Tel Aviv, Israel. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC73SSp4_pU&t=197.12s)]
