*  Harris, good afternoon. A lot of activity here along the southern front. I do just [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=59.98s)]
*  want to step out of the frame here so my cameraman can zoom in. You can see in [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=63.76s)]
*  the distance the Israelis are launching flares and it is lighting up the Gaza [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=68.52s)]
*  skyline. They are doing this in part to illuminate the area where there are [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=72.88s)]
*  ground forces working at this hour and also to mark targets for the Israeli [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=79.12s)]
*  Air Force that you can hear overhead. Those jets roaring. I do want to discuss [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=83.80000000000001s)]
*  the situation inside Gaza. As those forces are operating, we know there are [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=88.48s)]
*  239 hostages being held by Hamas and Fox News is learning today that a high [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  level Israeli official in coordination with the United States visited Doha on [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  Saturday to meet with Qatari negotiators specifically to discuss the hostage [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=103.86000000000001s)]
*  situation and further talks about the release of hostages. I do want to show [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=108.2s)]
*  you what it was like earlier today here along the border as Israeli forces were [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=112.4s)]
*  operating behind us. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=116.9s)]
*  You can see here the Israelis marking targets on the northeastern side of the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  Gaza Strip in the distant. You can hear the thud of artillery. This is a very [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=125.48s)]
*  active front and as the Israelis push deeper into Gaza, they anticipate there [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=130.0s)]
*  will be more resistance and it's part of the reason they continue strikes [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=136.0s)]
*  against different positions. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=140.0s)]
*  Ground forces are currently working on the western and eastern side of Gaza. It [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=143.6s)]
*  appears they are trying to encircle Gaza City. We do know earlier today the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=147.72s)]
*  spokesman for the Israeli military, Daniel Higare, spoke about the situation [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=152.16s)]
*  saying this. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=156.24s)]
*  Well done. Over the past day, we have expanded ground activities with [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=158.4s)]
*  additional forces entering the Gaza Strip, including infantry, armored corps, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=162.12s)]
*  combat engineering and artillery corps. Through integrated strikes of the ground [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=165.92s)]
*  forces and the IAF, dozens of terrorists were eliminated last night who had [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=169.79999999999998s)]
*  barricaded themselves in buildings and attempted to attack the forces that were [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=173.88s)]
*  moving in their direction. I want to explain and provide an example. We are [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  conducting expanded ground operations in the Gaza Strip. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=181.07999999999998s)]
*  Once again, I'm going to show you the scene behind me here because it's very [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=187.16s)]
*  active with those jets overhead. The Israelis clearly marking a position here [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=190.44s)]
*  just over the Gaza border in the distance off camera. I just saw an air [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=195.92s)]
*  strike and likely what you're going to see in the coming minutes here. They are [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=200.44s)]
*  picking out their targets inside Gaza, trying to determine what still needs to [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=205.24s)]
*  be hit. The Israelis say they've been engaged by Hamas militants from the Al [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=209.24s)]
*  Qassam Brigades. This is the military wing of Hamas. They have RPGs, they have [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  small arms and they have IEDs that they're using to engage the forces [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=218.16s)]
*  inside Gaza. We should also note the Palestinian civilians, those who heeded [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=222.64000000000001s)]
*  the warnings of the Israelis have started to stay in the south, but yet [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=227.16s)]
*  there are still many people in the northern part of the strip. It is [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=231.92000000000002s)]
*  complicating the Israeli efforts because they are fighting a bloody urban battle [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  and it is a battle within a civilian population. Harris, Trey, real quickly, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=239.22s)]
*  you and I talked last hour on the Faulkner focus about what those people [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=243.96s)]
*  are facing once they do leave the north to the south. Can you mention just a [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=246.96s)]
*  little bit of that so our outnumbered audience can hear you as well? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=250.48s)]
*  Absolutely. The situation for the more than 2 million Palestinians inside Gaza [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=255.76s)]
*  is dire. Life in Gaza was difficult before the war started because it is a [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=260.68s)]
*  strip of land 25 miles long that is controlled by Hamas, a group that we now [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=265.84s)]
*  understand was hoarding resources, fuel and food for themselves so they could [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=270.71999999999997s)]
*  launch this brutal assault on southern Israel and slaughter so many innocent [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=275.4s)]
*  civilians. And in the meantime, they were basically neglecting their own [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=279.32s)]
*  population that they control. And so now this population is facing a very [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=284.12s)]
*  difficult situation. There is dirty water for people to drink, limited food [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=288.36s)]
*  supply, a lack of medicine and support, and the Arab world is not trying to [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=292.6s)]
*  push enough supplies into Gaza to help those Palestinian civilians. And it is [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=297.56s)]
*  critical that that rafa crossing between Gaza and Egypt stay open for aid to [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=302.2s)]
*  flow in and allow foreign citizens to come out. Harrison? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=306.44s)]
*  Yeah, it really explains why we were getting those reports six days after Hamas [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=310.12s)]
*  terrorists killed all those Israeli civilians on October 7th. Just six days [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=314.6s)]
*  later, they were already the Palestinian people in trouble without food and [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=320.48s)]
*  water and so on and so forth. Those people were not taken care of before, so [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=324.56s)]
*  it didn't take much. In fact, there were no forces on the ground yet. There [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=329.4s)]
*  was really the kind of fighting that you're seeing now hadn't even been [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=333.04s)]
*  planned yet at that point, and they were already running short on resources. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=336.28s)]
*  That reporting is very helpful. Trade. Thank you very much. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On7RaUZE108&t=340.47999999999996s)]
