# Israeli military reportedly considering preemptive strike against Iran
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [August 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEBzG461xC4)
*  Well, presidential candidates will have to answer questions about the Middle East, and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEBzG461xC4&t=0.0s)]
*  it's very tense over there. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEBzG461xC4&t=4.68s)]
*  Chief Foreign Correspondent Trey Yengst joins us from Haifa, Israel. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEBzG461xC4&t=6.08s)]
*  He has a book coming out this fall about the October 7th Hamas massacre. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEBzG461xC4&t=10.88s)]
*  It's called Black Saturday, and with that comes a new title as well. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEBzG461xC4&t=15.8s)]
*  Trey, it's great to see you. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEBzG461xC4&t=20.36s)]
*  Good evening. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEBzG461xC4&t=22.36s)]
*  I think this is a very tense time. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEBzG461xC4&t=23.36s)]
*  I had the former Israeli Prime Minister on the story this afternoon saying they expect [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEBzG461xC4&t=24.8s)]
*  Iran to attack somewhere, some way, in the next 24 to 48 hours. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEBzG461xC4&t=30.16s)]
*  Yeah, Brett, exactly. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEBzG461xC4&t=37.0s)]
*  The attack from Iran could be just hours away, and the region is bracing for the possibility [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEBzG461xC4&t=38.72s)]
*  of this unraveling quickly. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEBzG461xC4&t=44.040000000000006s)]
*  Local media is reporting tonight the Israeli military is considering a preemptive strike [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEBzG461xC4&t=46.44s)]
*  against Iran's largest proxy in the region, Hezbollah, that sits just about 17 miles [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEBzG461xC4&t=51.68s)]
*  from where we are standing right now. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEBzG461xC4&t=57.4s)]
*  Earlier today, there was yet another drone attack in the northern part of this country, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEBzG461xC4&t=59.24s)]
*  injuring a number of people. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEBzG461xC4&t=63.6s)]
*  And as we look forward about how all of this is going to end, the Israelis are looking [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEBzG461xC4&t=65.8s)]
*  very close at the November election. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEBzG461xC4&t=69.36s)]
*  They understand that Vice President Harris and the Biden administration says the only [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEBzG461xC4&t=71.64s)]
*  way out of this rising tension is a ceasefire, but the Israelis say before any sort of ceasefire [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEBzG461xC4&t=75.92s)]
*  takes place, there will be offensive action as they brace for this attack from Iran and [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEBzG461xC4&t=81.38s)]
*  what the Israeli response will be. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEBzG461xC4&t=86.46s)]
*  In Black Saturday, we discuss how this war began back on October 7th and the days just [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEBzG461xC4&t=88.42s)]
*  after. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEBzG461xC4&t=93.5s)]
*  Brett? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEBzG461xC4&t=94.5s)]
*  We look forward to the book, and obviously we'll be tuning in very closely to see what [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEBzG461xC4&t=95.5s)]
*  happens over there in Israel. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEBzG461xC4&t=99.25999999999999s)]
*  Trey, thank you. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEBzG461xC4&t=101.1s)]
