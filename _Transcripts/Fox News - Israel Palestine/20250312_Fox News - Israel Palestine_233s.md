# Judge Jeanine: Court case for anti-Israel activist is ‘all theater’
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [March 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok)
*  Okay, with that we bring in Judge Jeanine Pirro, co-host of The Five, Judge Jeanine, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=0.0s)]
*  always great to have you here. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=4.4s)]
*  You see members of Congress there saying that he's just exercising his free speech rights, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=6.48s)]
*  they're very worked up about this, there are protesters everywhere. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=10.4s)]
*  How do you see his legal situation? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=13.620000000000001s)]
*  Well, first of all, let me say about the Democrats in Congress who were so worried about Mohammed [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=14.92s)]
*  Khalil. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=20.68s)]
*  They weren't worried about Lakin Reilly, and they wouldn't stand up for DJ Daniels, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=21.68s)]
*  a little boy with cancer, and they're all riled up about this Mohammed Khalil. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=26.84s)]
*  Let me explain something to you. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=31.56s)]
*  Mohammed Khalil was someone who was involved in the protest. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=32.88s)]
*  He was involved in organizing the protest, these college campus protests where Jewish [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=37.04s)]
*  students were harassed, where Jewish students did not feel safe on campus. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=41.620000000000005s)]
*  This is the United States of America. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=47.04s)]
*  Khalil is here, I think, just over two years. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=49.32s)]
*  And he has aligned himself and advocating for Hamas, which has been designated a foreign [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=53.2s)]
*  terrorist organization. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=59.36s)]
*  Marco Rubio has information that is classified that where he has been investigated as a national [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=61.440000000000005s)]
*  security threat in the past, but he has the power under Section 237 of the Immigration [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=68.4s)]
*  Naturalization Act, A4C, to have him deported. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=76.04s)]
*  And what's going on in Manhattan, Martha, is very interesting. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  It's all theater. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=84.88s)]
*  They moved. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=86.16s)]
*  Khalil's lawyer moved for a habeas corpus, a writ of habeas corpus, which means bring [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=87.16s)]
*  the body to New York. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=92.04s)]
*  Well, the body isn't in New York, and it ain't coming to New York. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=93.6s)]
*  The body's in Louisiana. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=96.52s)]
*  So they do not have the right to have this thing decided by a court. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=98.68s)]
*  This is a deportation issue that is not justiciable, as we say, as attorneys. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=104.5s)]
*  So you're saying that Marco Rubio, Secretary of State, has information on him that proves [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=109.68s)]
*  that he is a national security risk, because what we're seeing so far—you know, I just [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=115.84s)]
*  have questions as I look through all of this, trying to figure out what law he broke, Judge [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=122.92s)]
*  Jean. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=127.8s)]
*  What law did he break? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=128.8s)]
*  You know, we can all make judgments on his character and the fact that he's supportive [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=129.8s)]
*  of Yaya Sinwar if indeed he handed out these posters with his picture on them, supportive [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=134.2s)]
*  of October 7th, heinous. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=138.48s)]
*  What about lawbroken? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=142.35999999999999s)]
*  You don't need a lawbroken. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  You do not need to violate the law. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  You do not need to be charged with a criminal statute or convicted of one to be deported [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=147.79999999999998s)]
*  through— [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=153.76s)]
*  As a green card holder. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=154.76s)]
*  As a green card holder. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=156.48s)]
*  Now, he's saying that I am a—because I'm married to an American, the wife who says [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=157.48s)]
*  he was kidnapped but won't allow anyone to release her name. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=163.64s)]
*  He's saying that now I'm a legal resident. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=167.84s)]
*  No, you're not. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=170.12s)]
*  And if you are, let's assume that you are, whether you're a green card holder, visa, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=171.60000000000002s)]
*  or you consider yourself a resident based on your marriage, you still can be deported [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  under 237 of the INA. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=181.60000000000002s)]
*  And understand, he has a profile that they are familiar with. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=183.84s)]
*  This profile, they believe, is more than just someone protesting the First Amendment. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=188.38000000000002s)]
*  He has aligned himself with a foreign terrorist organization. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=193.52s)]
*  And we already know that under, I think it's Article 811, 82, and 83, if he endorses or [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=197.2s)]
*  espouses or persuades or organizes on behalf of those foreign terrorist organizations, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=203.96s)]
*  he is subject to deportation. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=209.76s)]
*  So this is a lot of— [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=211.8s)]
*  So the State Department itself can remove him. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=212.8s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=214.76s)]
*  No need to go through the courts. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=215.76s)]
*  No need. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=216.76s)]
*  It's not just issueable. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=217.76s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=218.76s)]
*  We'll see what happens there. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=219.76s)]
*  Judge Neen, always good to see you. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=220.76s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=221.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=222.76s)]
*  We'll see you on the 5. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=223.76s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=224.76s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=225.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yykTyID9sok&t=227.16s)]
