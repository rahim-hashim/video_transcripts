# GOP senator warns against pulling plug on Ukraine: 'It'll be worse than Afghanistan'
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [March 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y)
*  President Trump is proposing large-scale banking sanctions and tariffs on Russia until a ceasefire [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=0.0s)]
*  and a final peace settlement is reached with Ukraine, as Russia continues to pound the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=10.0s)]
*  country this weekend with missiles and drones. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=14.620000000000001s)]
*  Joining me now, GOP Senator Lindsey Graham. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=17.6s)]
*  Good to have you back, Senator. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=21.6s)]
*  So there's a pause right now on Ukrainian aid and intelligence sharing. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=22.6s)]
*  The White House reports that that is hampering Ukraine's ability to defend itself against [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=26.02s)]
*  this incoming new wave of attacks from Russia. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=29.78s)]
*  Have you talked with the White House about that? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=33.4s)]
*  How concerned are you about the long-term impacts of the pause? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=34.94s)]
*  Yeah, I talked to Mike Walz a couple of days ago. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=38.019999999999996s)]
*  The goal is to end the war honorably and justly. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=41.7s)]
*  You know, Zelensky blew it in the White House. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=45.78s)]
*  We'd been working on this mineral steel for a very long time, but we are where we are. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=47.78s)]
*  Yeah, I am worried about cutting off intelligence and weapons to Ukraine as long as the fighting [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=52.14s)]
*  is going on. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=56.980000000000004s)]
*  If we pull the plug on Ukraine, it'd be worse than Afghanistan. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=58.14s)]
*  I don't think President Trump has any desire to do that. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=61.14s)]
*  But until we have a ceasefire, I would give Ukraine what they need in terms of intelligence [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=64.62s)]
*  and weapons to defend themselves. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=69.5s)]
*  In terms of Russia, I will be introducing sanctions on their banking sector and on their [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=71.7s)]
*  energy sector next week, urging them to get to the table. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=76.62s)]
*  If they don't engage in ceasefire and peace talks with the administration, we should sanction [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=80.62s)]
*  the hell out of them, and I'll have legislation to do that next week. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=85.94s)]
*  Okay, we will be tracking that. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=89.46000000000001s)]
*  In the meantime, you mentioned the rare earth minerals deal that has been stalled after [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=91.06s)]
*  the disastrous meeting at the White House last week. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=94.48s)]
*  Yeah, disastrous. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=97.02000000000001s)]
*  But listen, you were one of the folks who met with President Zelensky before he went [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=98.02000000000001s)]
*  there. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=101.14s)]
*  Senator Chris Van Hollen was as well. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=102.14s)]
*  He was with me on the show last week. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=104.94s)]
*  Here's how he described that deal. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=106.38000000000001s)]
*  It was extortion, pure and simple. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=109.46s)]
*  It would be like in the middle of World War II, FDR saying to Churchill, we're not going [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=111.25999999999999s)]
*  to help you against the Nazis and Hitler unless you give up half of your mineral resources [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=115.94s)]
*  and half of your coal. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=120.3s)]
*  All right, two things. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=121.3s)]
*  What do you make of his characterization of the deal? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=123.02s)]
*  He was explaining it as we understood it at that time. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=124.58s)]
*  Maybe it's evolved. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=127.3s)]
*  But secondly, do you think that his Democratic colleagues or that he urged Zelensky to go [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=128.29999999999998s)]
*  to the White House and reject the deal? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=133.18s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=135.34s)]
*  Chris said, I like Chris personally, it's just ridiculous. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=137.98s)]
*  We're trying to integrate our economies. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=141.02s)]
*  We're trying to make sure that Ukraine has value to the American economy, a win-win situation. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=143.4s)]
*  They're the richest country in Europe in terms of critical minerals, which is the oil of [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=150.9s)]
*  the 21st century. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=155.7s)]
*  So doing a deal with Ukraine is beneficial to both countries. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=157.18s)]
*  It's not extortion. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=160.5s)]
*  Wouldn't it be nice to be able to do a deal with Ukraine where we can make $500 billion [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=161.7s)]
*  in the critical mineral space for our own economy, give them money, help them develop [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=167.66s)]
*  their resources so they can grow their economy and defend themselves? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=171.9s)]
*  That's not extortion. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=175.46s)]
*  That's a good business deal. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=176.82s)]
*  And to all these Democrats who are worried about this deal, what the hell did you do [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=177.82s)]
*  to deter Russia from invading Ukraine? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=181.3s)]
*  What did you do after Russia invaded Ukraine? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=184.1s)]
*  Pretty much nothing. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=186.66s)]
*  President Trump's going to end this war justly. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=187.9s)]
*  We should do this critical minerals deal. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=190.42s)]
*  We should keep arming Ukraine and providing them intelligence until it's ceasefire. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=192.54s)]
*  And we should tell Russia, if you don't engage in ceasefire discussions, we're going to [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=196.54s)]
*  sanction you. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=200.38s)]
*  We've got to put pressure on both sides to get them to the table to end this war. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=201.44s)]
*  The minerals deal is a win-win. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=205.14s)]
*  Well, it sounds like there's reporting this morning that the president needs more than [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=206.66s)]
*  just the minerals deal in order to move forward with giving back the aid, the intelligence [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=210.48s)]
*  sharing with Ukraine. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=215.85999999999999s)]
*  So listen, this all heads to Saudi Arabia this week. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=217.1s)]
*  Top U.S. and Ukrainian officials are going to be there negotiating. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=219.58s)]
*  What would you need to see to expect or to call that a success? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=223.14000000000001s)]
*  What concrete things coming from those meetings? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=226.38s)]
*  Well, I think we want to find out what does peace look like in the eyes of Ukraine. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=228.78s)]
*  They've already suggested they're ready for a ceasefire. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=234.74s)]
*  They've already suggested they're ready for peace talks. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=238.7s)]
*  Sit down with Ukraine this coming week and find out what a good deal looks like to them. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=241.46s)]
*  Then urge the Russians to sit down with the White House and compare notes and end this war. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=247.14s)]
*  Shuttle diplomacy will work. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=252.42s)]
*  But I want the Russians to know that I don't mind talking with you about how to end this war, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=254.5s)]
*  but you're going to be held accountable for this war. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=259.94s)]
*  And if they don't come to the table, the Russians, we should up sanctions like President Trump indicated. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=262.3s)]
*  But you're not helping anybody during these discussions if you do not provide the weapons [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=267.54s)]
*  necessary for Ukraine to defend themselves. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=272.02s)]
*  You're not helping end the war if you deny intelligence to Ukraine to defend themselves [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=274.74s)]
*  while the fighting is going on. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=280.02s)]
*  So I'm hoping we will get a view of the Ukraine's view of how the war ends next week and begin [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=281.58s)]
*  to find a way to end the war. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=288.78000000000003s)]
*  Well, another foreign policy challenge, tensions ratcheting up between Iran and the U.S. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=290.86s)]
*  The president told our Maria Bartiromo he sent over a letter to Iran's supreme leader on [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=296.14s)]
*  this weekend, not mentioning President Trump by name or the U.S., but saying he won't work [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=301.62s)]
*  with coercive governments or be bullied by them. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=305.18s)]
*  Where do we go next with Iran? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=308.3s)]
*  Because I mean, their nuclear program is of immense concern to people around the globe. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=309.86s)]
*  It's an immense concern to me. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=315.42s)]
*  It's the most destabilizing event on the planet. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=316.82s)]
*  It's for the Iranians to, I told him to have a nuclear weapon. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=320.7s)]
*  He would use it to further his religious agenda, which is to purify Islam in his own image [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=323.54s)]
*  as a Shiite, destroy the Jewish state and to drive us out. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=330.22s)]
*  He would use a nuclear weapon if he had it. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=334.3s)]
*  He has enough enriched uranium for six bombs. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=336.7s)]
*  There's no commercial purpose for enriched uranium at 60 percent. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=340.34000000000003s)]
*  We run peaceful nuclear reactors, three to five percent of enrichment. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=345.2s)]
*  Here's what a good deal will look like to me. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=349.18s)]
*  No more enrichment for Iran. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=352.46000000000004s)]
*  Take all the highly enriched uranium out of Iran. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=354.5s)]
*  I'm willing to buy it from them and allow them to have nuclear power where fuel rods [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=357.38s)]
*  are provided by either Russia or China or some international group. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=361.78s)]
*  Enrichment is the process that you use to make a bomb. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=366.54s)]
*  Iran should not be allowed to enrich. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=369.86s)]
*  The United Arab Emirates has a nuclear program. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=371.9s)]
*  They don't enrich uranium. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=374.18s)]
*  They get fuel rods from us. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=376.18s)]
*  That should be the outcome and it should be quick. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=378.3s)]
*  If you want to negotiate with Iran, you need to have an end game of where they have no [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=381.04s)]

*  If you don't put them on the clock and this thing drags out, they're going to rearm and [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=389.78s)]
*  retool. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=393.14s)]
*  I don't mind talking to them, but I want an end game to make sure they have no nuclear [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=394.14s)]
*  material to make a bomb when it's over. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=398.02s)]
*  They're out of the enrichment business and that we can verify everything I just said. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=400.18s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=405.62s)]
*  Before we leave that region, I want to talk about Syria as well. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=406.62s)]
*  There's a lot of news filtering in this weekend and really a ton crossing the wires this morning [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=409.3s)]

*  What should we be doing? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=424.88s)]
*  Well, number one, the guy who's in charge now, Ghulani, was associated with al-Baghdadi. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=425.88s)]
*  He's wearing a suit. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=432.44s)]
*  Does that mean he's no longer a jihadist? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=433.44s)]
*  I don't know, but their actions are very reminiscent of what happened in Iraq and Syria when ISIS [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=435.24s)]
*  took over. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=441.84000000000003s)]
*  They're going after their religious enemies. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=442.88s)]
*  The Alawites are Shiites. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=446.47999999999996s)]
*  These guys are Sunnis. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=448.28s)]
*  They're killing Christians. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=449.71999999999997s)]
*  I am very worried. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=450.85999999999996s)]
*  I would urge the administration to have somebody focused on Syria. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=452.08s)]
*  Saudi Arabia is talking to Ghulani, the head of HTS. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=455.96s)]
*  If you're going to talk about removing sanctions on Syria, you better have conditions to make [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=460.2s)]
*  sure they meet them before you remove those sanctions. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=465.23999999999995s)]
*  Is this al-Qaeda or ISIS light? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=468.28s)]
*  Or is this some new form of Islam that we can all live with? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=471.79999999999995s)]
*  I don't know, but I've never been more worried about the deterioration of Syria than I am [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=475.2s)]
*  now. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=479.79999999999995s)]
*  The world needs to get engaged with Syria before it's too late. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=480.79999999999995s)]
*  Okay, we got to go, but quickly, do enough Democrats vote with you in the Senate to avoid [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=483.35999999999996s)]
*  a shutdown on Friday? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=487.52s)]
*  Yeah, I believe we won't shut the government down come Friday, but the CR is terrible on [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=488.91999999999996s)]
*  defense and the border. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=494.79999999999995s)]
*  I want a commitment. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=496.44s)]
*  We're going to have more money for border and defense before I vote for the CR, but [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=497.44s)]
*  I think we'll keep the government funded. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=501.8s)]
*  The only thing we need to be shutting down is Iran's nuclear program, not our government. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2M9CqL-w3Y&t=503.71999999999997s)]
