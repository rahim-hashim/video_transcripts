# Retired US general warns war in Middle East has become a ‘very difficult situation'
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [September 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk)
*  So could we see a wider war in the Middle East? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=0.0s)]
*  Former U.S. CENTCOM Commander General Joseph Votel [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=3.44s)]
*  joins me now. General, great to see you. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=6.94s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=8.82s)]
*  It sure looks like Israel is trying to preempt [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=10.02s)]
*  a Hezbollah attack or invasion into Israel. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=14.16s)]
*  Do you think they'll succeed? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=16.96s)]
*  Well, first of all, it's great to be with you, David. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=19.2s)]
*  I think they're doing a lot of the right things right now. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=21.8s)]
*  They're clearly trying to exploit the disarray [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  that's been sown into Hezbollah by virtue of these attacks [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=26.8s)]
*  over the last week or so. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=30.8s)]
*  And I think what Israel's strategy is here [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=32.9s)]
*  is to, again, force Hezbollah to come to the table [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=36.0s)]
*  and avoid another war of attrition on their northern front. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=39.94s)]
*  They have a goal. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  They want to get people back into their homes. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=44.78s)]
*  And so they've got to figure out a way to do that. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=46.42s)]
*  And one of the ways they're doing that [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=48.86s)]
*  is through this extraordinary military pressure [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=50.16s)]
*  of applying all kinds of different tools. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=53.0s)]
*  Sabotage, strikes against launchers, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=55.06s)]
*  and then, of course, strikes against key leaders [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=57.36s)]
*  that are all adding up to have a fairly devastating effect [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  on Hezbollah right now. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=63.300000000000004s)]
*  By the way, these pager bombs are just extraordinary. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=65.86s)]
*  Had you ever seen anything like it at all in modern warfare? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=69.84s)]
*  Well, again, I won't talk too much about this. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=74.38s)]
*  I mean, we have special operations capabilities, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=77.98s)]
*  certainly the Israelis do. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=80.78s)]
*  And we develop these types of unique capabilities [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=82.74s)]
*  to give our decision makers lots of options. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=87.42s)]
*  Clearly, the Israelis have refined that [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=90.36s)]
*  and were able to do this at a large scale here. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=93.92s)]
*  Now, you say it was successful. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=97.36s)]
*  Obviously, it did have a chilling effect [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=98.82s)]
*  on the Hezbollah terrorists, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=102.34s)]
*  and perhaps Iran, their paymasters. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=104.16s)]
*  But there are certain U.S. policy, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=106.4s)]
*  I know I'm not gonna put you [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=109.24s)]
*  in the political crossfire here, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=110.7s)]
*  but yeah, Bernie Sanders saying that [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=112.46s)]
*  we should cancel a $20 billion contract [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=114.83999999999999s)]
*  to sell arms to Israel because of it. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=119.17999999999999s)]
*  AOC's saying that it was devastating. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=121.34s)]
*  There were innocents that were killed [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=123.84s)]
*  in these explosions apparently as well, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=125.58s)]
*  or at least severely injured. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=127.67999999999999s)]
*  What do you make of all that? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=129.92s)]
*  I mean, of the fact that some people are saying [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=131.51999999999998s)]
*  that is evidence that we should withdraw [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=134.01999999999998s)]
*  some of our support for Israel. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=136.66s)]
*  Yeah, well, as you pointed out [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=139.22000000000003s)]
*  just a few moments ago here, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=141.78s)]
*  Ibrahim Akhil is responsible [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=143.52s)]
*  for a couple hundred American deaths. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  When you combine that with the death of Fawad Shakur, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=148.56s)]
*  who was killed about a month ago, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=151.86s)]
*  this is over 300 American citizens [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=153.60000000000002s)]
*  who were killed on their orders. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=156.26000000000002s)]
*  And so this is Hezbollah. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=158.8s)]
*  They're a designated terrorist organization, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=160.5s)]
*  and Israel has to have the means to go after them. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=163.20000000000002s)]
*  They're designated by us as well. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=166.5s)]
*  Well, as I look at the various techniques they're using here, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=168.89999999999998s)]
*  I mean, I think they are attempting to apply [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=172.94s)]
*  the principles of military targeting, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=175.78s)]
*  distinction, proportionality, military necessity, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=177.73999999999998s)]
*  for certain, I think, are all in this. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=180.73999999999998s)]
*  Again, none of this is perfect, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=183.62s)]
*  and it's tragic that there's any innocent civilian lives [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=185.07999999999998s)]
*  taken in this, but again, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=189.62s)]
*  this is a very, very difficult situation. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=191.26s)]
*  I think withholding support to Israel [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=193.08s)]
*  is probably not the right approach at this particular point. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=196.74s)]
*  And by the way, Hezbollah, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=199.32s)]
*  it's not just the United States [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=200.48s)]
*  outside of the Middle East that has suffered. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=202.32s)]
*  Argentina had a devastating attack [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=204.72s)]
*  on a Jewish facility years ago. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=207.22s)]
*  I mean, they are an international terrorist organization, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=209.4s)]
*  but of course, their money comes from Iran. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=212.6s)]
*  Their support comes from Iran. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=215.6s)]
*  One of the people who had the pager blow up [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=217.4s)]
*  was apparently the ambassador to Lebanon from Iran. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=220.12s)]
*  So we had under the previous administration [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=223.64s)]
*  a maximum pressure campaign against Iran [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=227.26s)]
*  that essentially economically brought them to their knees. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=230.79999999999998s)]
*  Now that was removed by the Biden-Harris administration. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=233.76s)]
*  Should we put that back on? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=237.2s)]
*  Was that an effective way of keeping Iran at bay? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=239.2s)]
*  Well, I think you're hitting on the most important point here, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=243.88s)]
*  and that is behind all of this is Iran, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=246.92s)]
*  and we have to have a strategy that holds Iran accountable [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=249.14000000000001s)]
*  and causes them to change behavior across the region. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=252.3s)]
*  And I think we have to leverage [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=257.18s)]
*  all the tools that are available, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=258.54s)]
*  whether it's economic tools, whether it's diplomatic tools, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=260.74s)]
*  whether it's informational tools, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=263.54s)]
*  or whether it's military tools to hold Iran accountable [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=264.78000000000003s)]
*  and bring them to heel on this situation. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=268.26s)]
*  It all comes back to Iran. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=273.62s)]
*  Yeah. General Botel, you make a lot of sense. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=275.5s)]
*  Unfortunately, there's not a lot of common sense [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=277.91999999999996s)]
*  inside the beltway these days, so we'll see what happens. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=279.59999999999997s)]
*  But thank you so much for joining us today. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=282.59999999999997s)]
*  Thank you, David. Good to be with you. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZME_GSZqk&t=284.44s)]
