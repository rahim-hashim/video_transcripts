# 'INFLECTION POINT': Biden, Zelenskyy meet at White House
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4)
*  Well, Mr. President, welcome back. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=2.0s)]
*  Welcome back to the White House and the Oval Office. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=3.0s)]
*  And it's great to be at your side once again. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=6.3s)]
*  We're going to stay at your side. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  You know, we stand at a real inflection point in history. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=11.14s)]
*  I know you and I have talked about this, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=14.4s)]
*  where the decisions we make now are going to determine [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=15.84s)]
*  the future for decades to come, particularly in Europe. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=19.22s)]
*  And this is one of those moments. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=22.62s)]
*  Congress needs to pass a supplemental funding to Ukraine [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  before they break the holiday recess, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=29.36s)]
*  before they give Putin the greatest Christmas gift [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  they could possibly give him. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=34.82s)]
*  And so because we've seen what happens when dictators [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=36.7s)]
*  don't pay the price for the damage and the death [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=40.46s)]
*  and the destruction they cause, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=42.86s)]
*  and they keep going when no price is paid, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=44.84s)]
*  the threats to America, to Europe, and the world [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  will only keep rising if we don't act. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=51.28s)]
*  And I intend that we act. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=53.84s)]
*  American people, Democrats and Republicans alike, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=56.24s)]
*  I think understand this, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=60.38s)]
*  and they understand the very real fight [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=61.68000000000001s)]
*  that's going on right now. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=63.980000000000004s)]
*  In the winter, this winter, Putin plans once again [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=66.22s)]
*  to bombard Ukraine's electric grid. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  Intends to, with rockets and plunging families in the darkness [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=71.7s)]
*  in the coldest part of the year and doing great damage. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=76.44s)]
*  We can't and won't let him succeed. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=80.04s)]
*  We mustn't let him succeed in that. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=81.94s)]
*  Mr. President, I called on Congress to do the right thing, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=84.30000000000001s)]
*  to stand with Ukraine and to stand up for freedom. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=87.80000000000001s)]
*  And I want to thank you for being here. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=91.06s)]
*  You're going to help the cause, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=92.5s)]
*  and I don't want you giving up hope. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=94.0s)]
*  Thank you so much, Mr. President. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=96.34s)]
*  Dear journalists, I'm really glad to be here [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=98.48s)]
*  at the White House today [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=101.82000000000001s)]
*  and share some very important messages. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=103.38000000000001s)]
*  Thank you for your invitation. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=105.28s)]
*  And I'd like to thank America and all partners for the support. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=106.52000000000001s)]
*  And today, the special day, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=111.0s)]
*  special day for Ukraine, Ukrainian people. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  It's a day of our land forces, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=115.14s)]
*  almost 600,000 incredibly brave Ukrainian sons [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=116.78s)]
*  and daughters are on the battlefield, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=121.64s)]
*  and they were powerful. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=123.54s)]
*  This is their day, and really, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=125.22s)]
*  they prove every day that Ukraine can win. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=128.58s)]
*  And our forces are advancing, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=131.48000000000002s)]
*  and we have successfully defeated Russia in the Black Sea, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=133.32s)]
*  and Russia is hiding the remnants of its naval fleet [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=136.78s)]
*  in remote base. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=142.57999999999998s)]
*  And meanwhile, Ukraine has set up an expert corridor [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=144.85999999999999s)]
*  in the Black Sea that's really boosting our economy [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  and global food security. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=151.16s)]
*  Yesterday, I met with IMF and World Bank, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=153.56s)]
*  and they impressed with the Ukraine's economic growth, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=157.45999999999998s)]
*  almost 5 percent, and that's significant. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=160.7s)]
*  Ukraine is gradually becoming less depend on aid, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=163.56s)]
*  and we are moving to the right, I think, right direction, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=167.32s)]
*  and I want to discuss with the President [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=170.45999999999998s)]
*  how to strengthen it, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=172.45999999999998s)]
*  especially enhancing our air defense [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=174.85999999999999s)]
*  and ability to destroy Russia's logistics. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=177.56s)]
*  Our goals for 24th are clear, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=180.66s)]
*  take away Russia's superiority [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=183.14s)]
*  and disrupt their offensive operations. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=185.88s)]
*  And I think it's real. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=189.29999999999998s)]
*  And also, some other important things, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=191.29999999999998s)]
*  I met with the heads of American defense companies yesterday. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=193.12s)]

*  Really powerful companies. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=198.66000000000003s)]
*  I thank them and thanks all the workers, engineers, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=200.46s)]
*  managers who built and built the strengths of American weapons, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=205.9s)]
*  helping Ukraine boost the development [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=211.8s)]
*  of arsenals of democracy. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=213.98000000000002s)]
*  President Biden agreed, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=216.20000000000002s)]
*  and we spoke about it in September, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=218.38000000000002s)]
*  to join weapon co-production. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=220.98s)]
*  It's very important for us, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=222.98s)]
*  and we'll discuss how to speed up this. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=224.54s)]
*  We also need to work faster with the frozen Russian assets, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=228.12s)]
*  over 300 billion frozen assets from terrorists, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=232.96s)]
*  and we should use it to protect against Russian terror, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=238.52s)]
*  and I want to talk about some details regarding our reforms [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=242.06s)]

*  and we are successful, I think. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OzIccUeg4&t=254.0s)]
