# First American citizen released from Hamas' captivity
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zr8TbpXcsw)
*  Fox News alert hostage negotiations continue this morning as we enter the fourth and final [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zr8TbpXcsw&t=0.0s)]
*  day of Israel's temporary ceasefire deal with Hamas. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zr8TbpXcsw&t=7.0s)]
*  The terror group just released 17 more people yesterday. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zr8TbpXcsw&t=10.8s)]
*  You are watching Fox and Friends First on this Monday morning. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zr8TbpXcsw&t=14.4s)]
*  I'm Carly Schimkes. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zr8TbpXcsw&t=17.32s)]
*  And I'm Joey Jones in for Todd Pyro. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zr8TbpXcsw&t=18.32s)]
*  One of those hostages was four-year-old American citizen Abigail Eden. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zr8TbpXcsw&t=19.96s)]
*  She watched her parents die on October 7th and just spent her birthday in captivity. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zr8TbpXcsw&t=24.86s)]
*  Trey Yankst is live at the Schneider Children's Hospital Medical Center in Israel with more. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zr8TbpXcsw&t=29.84s)]
*  Trey, good morning to you. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zr8TbpXcsw&t=34.64s)]
*  Yeah, hey guys. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zr8TbpXcsw&t=36.64s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zr8TbpXcsw&t=39.16s)]
*  Overnight for the third straight evening, hostages were released from Gaza. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zr8TbpXcsw&t=40.16s)]
*  As part of this larger ceasefire deal, we're talking about 14 Israeli nationals and three [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zr8TbpXcsw&t=44.0s)]
*  Thai nationals, among them nine children that were flown here to the Schneider Children's [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zr8TbpXcsw&t=48.72s)]
*  Hospital outside of Tel Aviv. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zr8TbpXcsw&t=53.56s)]
*  Among the group, four-year-old Abigail Eden, an American Israeli citizen, both of her parents [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zr8TbpXcsw&t=56.2s)]
*  were killed, but she became a symbol of survival and hope, also a reminder of the brutality [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zr8TbpXcsw&t=60.980000000000004s)]
*  inflicted by Hamas. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zr8TbpXcsw&t=66.36s)]
*  Yesterday, President Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zr8TbpXcsw&t=67.88s)]
*  release of Abigail. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zr8TbpXcsw&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  Netanyahu had this to say. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zr8TbpXcsw&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  The little girl, Abigail, what a joy to see her with us. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zr8TbpXcsw&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  But on the other hand, what a pain that she returns to the reality of no parents. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zr8TbpXcsw&t=81.68s)]
*  She has no parents, but she has a whole nation that embraces her. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zr8TbpXcsw&t=86.56s)]
*  As you mentioned, today is the last day of the four-day ceasefire that has been acting [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zr8TbpXcsw&t=93.56s)]
*  as a humanitarian pause for the citizens of Gaza, hundreds of aid trucks making their [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zr8TbpXcsw&t=98.04s)]
*  way into the Gaza Strip, and questions today about if this ceasefire will be extended. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zr8TbpXcsw&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  Hamas says they are open to the idea, and according to the initial agreement, they would [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zr8TbpXcsw&t=108.4s)]
*  have to release 10 additional hostages for each day of a pause in fighting. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zr8TbpXcsw&t=111.96000000000001s)]
*  Guys? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zr8TbpXcsw&t=116.56s)]
*  All right, Trey Angsly, for us, thank you so much for the very latest there. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zr8TbpXcsw&t=117.56s)]
