# Freeing hostages, destroying Hamas are not mutually exclusive: Dr. Ophir Falk
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10)
*  So how is the ceasefire and the hostage release going from Israel's perspective? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's ask Dr. Ophir Fok. He is a foreign policy advisor to Israeli Prime Minister [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu. Dr. Fok, good to see you. Thank you for being here. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=10.88s)]
*  Let me just ask that question I was discussing with Alex Hogan. I don't know if you heard, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=14.72s)]
*  but as to the sentiment of the Israeli people right now, are they more interested in getting [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=18.32s)]
*  the hostages back than they are in immediately pursuing the case against Hamas in Gaza? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=24.88s)]
*  Thank you for having me, David. Well, we have two missions in this war. One is to destroy Hamas, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  and the other is to free the hostages. Those two missions are not mutually exclusive. To the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=40.16s)]
*  contrary, they actually complement one another. We're doing everything we can right now to get [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=45.2s)]
*  the hostages out, to free the hostages as quickly as possible, and immediately after this pause for [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=50.96s)]
*  humanitarian purposes, we will continue to destroy Hamas. There's no other alternative [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=57.68s)]
*  but to destroy this genocidal organization. But it does seem that Hamas itself is trying to string [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  out the release as long as possible to maintain the ceasefire as long as possible in order to [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=69.44s)]
*  regroup their fighting against Israel. Is that not correct? Well, Israel is fully united, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=76.32s)]
*  completely united. The people are united. The government is united. Prime Minister [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=83.83999999999999s)]
*  Netanyahu's war cabinet is completely united to destroy Hamas and to free the hostages. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=88.24s)]
*  We've been united like never before. Clearly, the Hamas want to extend this pause, the only [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=93.83999999999999s)]
*  thing that has facilitated this pause and the release of hostages is the pressure that the IDF [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=101.44s)]
*  has pounded Hamas. That's actually the only thing that will continue to facilitate the hostage [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=109.44s)]
*  release. But I'm just wondering how much longer will this process take? In that time, which could [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=116.56s)]
*  be weeks if it's taking, if you only are able to get a dozen or fewer hostages per day, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=123.28s)]
*  because there are still another 200 and so hostages remaining, correct? And so it could take a long [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=131.44s)]
*  time before you're able to continue with your fight against Hamas. True. So the deal that was [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  structured that the United States and the president personally helped structure is that for every 10 [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=145.52s)]
*  hostages released, there will be one more day of pause. So for every 10 hostages released, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=152.24s)]
*  Hamas will live for another day. But at the end of the day, Hamas will be destroyed. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=160.4s)]
*  So I'm just doing a quick calculation that adds up to about a month of a pause. That's a long time [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  during which Hamas could restructure itself militarily, no? Well, we're fully prepared [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=172.72s)]
*  to return the fight back into Gaza and into Hamas. And we have absolutely no other alternative. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=180.48s)]
*  The day after Hamas will be built on a 3D model. One is to destroy Hamas. Two is to demilitarize [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=188.64s)]
*  Gaza so there will be no threat to Israel from the 360 square kilometers south of our border. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=195.83999999999997s)]
*  And three, and most importantly, is to deradicalize Gaza and the Palestinian society. Once we do that, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=203.28s)]
*  once we destroy, demilitarize, and deradicalize Gaza, we will be able, or an international [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=210.0s)]
*  community will be able to rebuild Gaza with a hope for peace. Let me just ask how Israel is going [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=216.48s)]
*  about about its daily business, doing things like farming, keeping the factories going, etc. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=222.95999999999998s)]
*  Has all that been put on a pause or is it continuing and is the country continuing to run? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=230.72s)]
*  Israel is a vibrant democracy and a striving economy. We have a striving economy. And [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=240.16s)]
*  after the initial setback of a few days, the Israeli economy is back almost to normal. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=246.72s)]
*  Clearly, we're in war right now and it affects the public and the public is concerned. And we have [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  tens of thousands of reservists taking part in the war against Hamas and to dismantle Hamas. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=259.12s)]
*  But Israel is also a country that is used to war. We've had five different wars and we know how to [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=266.08s)]
*  bounce back and we have a strong economy and Israel, you know, is a modern miracle. I don't [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=272.56s)]
*  know if you heard our discussion with General Jack Keene, but we were talking about the role that Iran [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=276.96s)]
*  has played and continues to play in the situation, not only with Hamas, but also in Hezbollah, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=281.44s)]
*  that its involvement goes beyond just financing those terrorist organizations, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=288.56s)]
*  but actually is involved in command and control of those organizations. What are your feelings about [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=294.4s)]
*  that? Right, so clearly the Hamas and the Hezbollah are proxies of Iran. 93 percent of the military [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=299.36s)]
*  budget from Hamas comes from Iran and we know what their responsibility is. I would not, or actually, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=308.8s)]
*  I would suggest that Iran listen closely and carefully to the President of the United States [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=316.48s)]
*  who told them not to enter this war. And if you think of entering the war, they should simply [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=321.68s)]
*  don't enter it. I think they haven't done so today, but we're fully prepared for a second [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=327.12s)]
*  front, which we do not want. We do not want a second front. We're fully focused on destroying [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=334.56s)]
*  Hamas and freeing our hostages, but if a second front is opened against us, we will, we are prepared [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=339.92s)]
*  and we'll do what's needed. Dr. Ofer Fok, we thank you very much for joining us. Our best wish is [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=347.2s)]
*  let's hope that we get out all of the hostages as soon as possible and best of luck to you, sir. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILDy6Dnu10&t=353.44s)]
