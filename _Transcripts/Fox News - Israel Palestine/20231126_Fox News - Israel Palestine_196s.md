# ‘DEAL WITH THE DEVIL’: Hamas is ‘playing’ with Israel, Danny Danon warns
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I)
*  With that, let us bring in former Israeli ambassador to the UN and member of Israel's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=0.0s)]
*  Vanessa Dani Danin. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=4.24s)]
*  Ambassador, thanks so much for being here. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=6.0s)]
*  What are you hearing regarding this report that an American could be released today, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=7.76s)]
*  according to Jake Sullivan? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  We definitely hope to see also Americans on the list. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=17.32s)]
*  We are committed to bring everybody back, but no one can forget the story of Abigail [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=20.6s)]
*  old that both of her parents were massacred in front of her. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=26.48s)]
*  Her brother and sister were able to hide next to the body of the mother, and she was kidnapped [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=30.12s)]
*  by herself. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=35.4s)]
*  So she's in hostage for 50 days, and we hope to see her tonight. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=36.4s)]
*  We also remember what happened last night, that Hamas terrorist organization played with [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=41.879999999999995s)]
*  the entire nation of Israel, delaying the release of the hostages. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=46.88s)]
*  So we hope it will not be the case tonight. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=50.96s)]
*  But you know, we signed a deal with the devil. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  We are aware of that. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=55.36s)]
*  We had no choice. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=56.36s)]
*  That's why every time we take it day by day, hour by hour, and we hope to see the third [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=57.64s)]
*  group coming in tonight. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=63.28s)]
*  Do you expect more of these quote unquote delays by Hamas in order to extract more concessions [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=65.16s)]
*  as these releases go forward? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=70.56s)]
*  There is no reason for a delay. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=73.28s)]
*  And also look what happened yesterday. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=76.6s)]
*  The Hamas organization raised a few issues, but they could have done it during the day. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=78.72s)]
*  They waited to the minute before they actually gave the hostages to the Red Cross, in the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=84.88s)]
*  last minute. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=89.8s)]
*  So if they have concerns, they should have raised it during the day. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=90.8s)]
*  I hope it will be smooth, but they should not play with us. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=94.24s)]
*  We are committed to the agreement, but if they will breach the agreement, they will [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  pay a heavy price. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=102.44s)]
*  And I want to remind you, Thor, that in a few days, we intend to continue the military [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=103.92s)]
*  operation to find the leadership of Hamas, to make them pay for the atrocities they committed [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=109.12s)]
*  So maybe now they feel secure, but they should not because we are coming after them. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=114.8s)]
*  Do you think, based upon what you literally just said, that the pause will extend beyond [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=119.84s)]
*  this negotiated period from both the Israeli and the Hamas side? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=124.56s)]
*  Basically, is there a temperament? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=127.88s)]
*  Is there a feeling that we could get more in terms of negotiated days of hostage release? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=130.12s)]
*  Because of our commitment to bring back the hostages, especially the children and the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=138.76s)]
*  mothers, we actually, in the agreement, we put a note that we can extend the agreement [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=143.36s)]
*  for another five days and to release another 50 hostages. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=150.4s)]
*  So basically, I think tomorrow we will know whether the Hamas organization wants to extend [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=154.28s)]
*  the pause or not. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=159.4s)]
*  But I can tell you that we are getting ready for starting again the military operation. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=161.16000000000003s)]
*  Our troops are there, paying attention to the threats. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=166.68s)]
*  And I think more pressure on Hamas at the end will bring all the hostages back home. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=170.28s)]
*  To hear you say it, it seems like the ball is in Hamas' court, whether they want to play [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=175.28s)]
*  ball following the extended pause. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=179.04s)]
*  And if not, the IDF sounds like it is ready to go. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=180.76s)]
*  Danny Denne, thank you, sir. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBaQQbe3d5I&t=183.64s)]
