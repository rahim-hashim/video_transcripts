# Six police officers injured after anti-Israel rally ERUPTS near DNC
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA)
*  Six U.S. Capitol Police officers hurt in a violent pro-Palestinian protest outside the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=0.0s)]
*  DNC headquarters in Washington. Democrat lawmakers had to be evacuated and House [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  offices went on lockdown. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=11.28s)]
*  How did you get your reaction to what we saw happening at the DNC this evening, professors? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=13.88s)]
*  Yeah, I haven't really seen it because I've been so busy with getting the – staying [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=19.0s)]
*  – keeping the government open and getting NDAA done. So I'll have to comment tomorrow. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=25.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=29.76s)]
*  But just to follow up on that, six U.S. Capitol Police officers were injured this evening. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=30.26s)]
*  I'm not going to comment until I see the details. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  Former Georgia congressman and Iraq War veteran Doug Collins joins us now. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  Doug, what do you think about this level of violence outside the DNC? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  Violence? Are you saying violence? Nobody else is covering violence. I mean, if anything else – [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=49.52s)]
*  if this had been anything else besides pro-Hamas demonstrators, which is just, you know, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=53.28s)]
*  in and of itself is amazing to me – Democratic lawmakers will be on the front steps of the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=57.44s)]
*  Capitol to be at every place yelling that this is, you know, an attack against the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=61.12s)]
*  government and democracy and everything else. This is just really sad when you see Chuck Schumer [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=64.8s)]
*  basically avoiding questions where his own members and House members were having to be locked down [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=68.88s)]
*  because of this kind of violence. Don't tell me this was mostly peaceful. This is not mostly [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=72.8s)]
*  peaceful. These people are not here to have a mostly peaceful protest. And it's sad that [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=77.68s)]
*  Chuck Schumer just won't come out and say that. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=81.52s)]
*  But why? I mean, Chuck Schumer is one of the most pro-Israel voices in Congress. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=84.0s)]
*  If not him, Doug, then who? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=89.44s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. And that is sad because he is one of those voices that you would look to at [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=92.56s)]
*  this to say something. But maybe it's just – he really is just baffled by this because, I mean, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=96.8s)]
*  this is something that should be easily condemned and he won't do it. I mean, you don't know if [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=102.0s)]
*  that's still the forces of the pro-Hamas, you know, and the pro-other side ceasefire group that is in [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=106.08s)]
*  Washington right now influence on the Democratic Party. Maybe that's why he's not talking about it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=112.24s)]
*  But it is sort of strange that he wouldn't even say anything about it last night. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=116.56s)]
*  Yeah, well, there was a march for Israel that took place the day before this happened. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=121.36s)]
*  Three hundred thousand people strong. It was a very peaceful and beautiful event. And then you [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  see what's going on on your screen right here where six police officers were hurt. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=131.68s)]
*  It – there's a big difference in the mood and how the two sides are behaving with this regard. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=135.84s)]
*  Doug, we also want to ask you about this brand new Fox polling that shows Donald Trump way in the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=143.20000000000002s)]
*  lead on the Republican side, 62 percent support. That's about 50 points. There's a 50-point gap [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=149.28s)]
*  between him and Ron DeSantis there. There's also a poll that shows Joe Biden's approval rating at [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=155.84s)]
*  record lows, down to 40 percent. So on paper back to back, these two things would look [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=162.08s)]
*  good for Donald Trump, bad for Joe Biden. But what do you think about this? And can you really glean [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  anything from polls this far out? You could glean that Joe Biden is very unpopular right now, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=173.84s)]
*  and this is very much of a concern for Democrats. You can also glean the fact that Donald Trump is [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=179.44s)]
*  by far the front runner and at this point will be the nominee for the Republican Party. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=184.24s)]
*  What it shows, though, is that there's a long way away. We're a year away. And I think this is why [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=188.72s)]
*  the Democrats in particular are so concerned because they don't see these numbers moving. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=192.96s)]
*  If there's anything, they see it going backwards. And they see the way that Donald – the way that [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=196.48s)]
*  Donald Trump, you know, is continuing to maintain that lead. But they also see how every time Joe [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=200.32s)]
*  Biden seems to be more out in public on things that he should be winning on, he's actually going [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=204.16s)]
*  backwards. And that is – that's a concern for them, and that's what you would take away at this [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=208.8s)]
*  snapshot in time. By the way, that 300,000 people who approached – who was on the mall just a couple [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=212.48s)]
*  days ago, the Washington Post deemed it good enough to make the Metro section not front page. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=217.44s)]
*  It's unreal. Doug, 10 seconds to you at this point. Is it time for the GOP to coalesce [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=222.32s)]
*  around Donald J. Trump as its nominee? It's getting to that point, and I think you'll see [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=226.8s)]
*  that after the primary start. We need to get into our elections, but right now that's what the polls [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=231.52s)]
*  are showing. That's what people are asking for. Doug Collins, we always appreciate your time. We [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=234.96s)]
*  thank you very much for joining us on a very busy Thursday morning. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ArFUlA2gA&t=240.16s)]
