# Yale student stabbed in the eye during anti-Israel protest
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI)
*  So that was the scene at Yale over the weekend, anti-Israel protests turning violent, injuring [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=0.0s)]
*  our next guest. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=12.68s)]
*  She wrote a column on this saying, quote, I was stabbed in the eye at Yale. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=13.82s)]
*  The school has allowed anti-Israel students to run roughshod over their most basic policies. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=18.36s)]
*  Yesterday, she writes, I paid the price for their inaction. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=24.44s)]
*  Yale student Sahar Tartak needed hospital treatment for that injury. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=29.32s)]
*  She is doing well now, which we're happy to say, and she joins us now. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=33.2s)]
*  Sahar, welcome. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=36.68s)]
*  It's good to have you with us. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=37.68s)]
*  Your piece is very moving on this, this morning in the free press. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=39.52s)]
*  Tell me a little bit about what was going on when you were there. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=43.08s)]
*  What did you see all around you, and then what happened? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=47.36s)]
*  Sure, of course. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=50.28s)]
*  Over the past week or so at Yale, anti-Semitic student protesters have taken over a central [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=53.12s)]
*  plaza on our campus, setting up a tent encampment, among other things, pictures to commemorate [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=61.08s)]
*  terrorists. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=67.44s)]
*  And this culminated in multiple nights of overnight encampment in the central plaza [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=70.12s)]
*  and protests with hundreds of people. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=75.84s)]
*  I think it was 500 when I came on Saturday night. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  And as soon as I was identified with my friend, who wears a black hat, as visibly Orthodox [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=84.04s)]
*  Jewish students, I was immediately blockaded by protest organizers. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=89.16s)]
*  And everywhere I walked, there was a line of protest organizers standing in front of [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=94.44s)]
*  me linking arms so that I could not walk forward. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=99.08000000000001s)]
*  And the rest of the students at the rally noticed this, the other 500 students at this [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=102.56s)]
*  violent rally. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=107.75999999999999s)]
*  And they saw me, and so they began to taunt me as well, because they recognized that I [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=109.24s)]
*  was there, I was something that they view as an enemy. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=114.19999999999999s)]
*  And finally, the taunting continued and escalated, and I was just there to record them. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=117.6s)]
*  And the taunting escalated until somebody waved a Palestinian flag in my face and then [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=122.72s)]
*  jabbed me in my left eye. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=127.08s)]
*  And from there, when I tried to run after him, the human blockade of protest organizers [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=128.92s)]
*  continued to stand in front of me to stop me from catching my assailant. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=134.11999999999998s)]
*  And so I went to the hospital. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=138.83999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's extraordinary. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=140.72s)]
*  You know, it's stunning. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=143.32s)]
*  We're just looking at the banner that they're holding up on liberation. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=144.6s)]
*  And there's a great irony, because right behind it is a memorial on campus to those who fought [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  in... [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=155.16s)]
*  The banner's right behind this banner. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=156.2s)]
*  They say, in memory of the men of Yale who, true to our traditions, gave their lives that [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=158.35999999999999s)]
*  freedom might not perish. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=163.82s)]
*  What do you think about that? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=166.85999999999999s)]
*  And what do you think about what the leadership at Yale is upholding today? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=168.44s)]
*  Yeah, so this plaza includes a World War II memorial. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=173.0s)]
*  A couple nights ago, hundreds of students cheered and screamed, Viva, Viva, Palestina, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=179.24s)]
*  as they tore down the American flag from the flagpole. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=186.12s)]
*  And it took days for them to face minimal repercussions. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=189.76000000000002s)]
*  Today there were some arrests, and then many of the students who were arrested were then [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=193.28s)]
*  released to return to a protest. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=197.16000000000003s)]
*  You know, we're looking at these scenes, and prominent in many of them in these videos [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=201.16000000000003s)]
*  are watermelons. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=205.46s)]
*  If you could explain the meaning of that to us. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  And also, the chanting of, from the river to the sea. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=210.0s)]
*  We know studies were done back in December that showed that many of the people who were [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=215.16s)]
*  saying it had no idea what river and what sea. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=218.76s)]
*  Sahar? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=221.72s)]
*  Sure. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=222.72s)]
*  So, we've seen the watermelon all over campus. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=223.72s)]
*  It's supposed to be a symbol basically against the Jewish people and in favor, like all the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=227.64s)]
*  other symbols that these students are using in favor of violent, terroristic acts against [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=234.08s)]
*  Jews in the state of Israel as a form of liberation. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=240.20000000000002s)]
*  I mean, these students have chanted, there is only one solution, Intifada Revolution, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=243.48000000000002s)]
*  which is a direct reference to uprisings that included suicide bombs in Israel and killed [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=251.88000000000002s)]
*  civilians. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=258.32s)]
*  October 7th, they absolutely celebrated and of course justified these events en masse. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=259.32s)]
*  Yeah, I know those students. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=265.56s)]
*  Sorry, I just recognized one of them from class. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=267.68s)]
*  Like this is really, it's really painful to realize that your peers have joined the Nazi [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=270.52s)]
*  party. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=277.12s)]
*  It's stunning and very personal for you. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=278.12s)]
*  It is, I feel for you. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=282.96s)]
*  And we're glad that your eye is okay. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=285.68s)]
*  I know that your mother had her eye injured in Iran in a not dissimilar situation. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=287.44s)]
*  Thank you for your bravery. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moI16iPI0qI&t=293.24s)]
