# Time is not on Ukraine's side; It's not on our side either: John Kirby
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [March 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI)
*  Joining us now, White House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=0.0s)]
*  Admiral, welcome back to Fox News Sunday. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=3.96s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=5.76s)]
*  To be with you, Shannon. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=6.76s)]
*  OK, so that speech that Chuck Schumer gave on Thursday, he lumped Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=7.76s)]
*  Netanyahu in with Hamas as one of the obstacles to peace. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=12.56s)]
*  He called for new elections there. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=15.860000000000001s)]
*  He said people within the government who oppose a Palestinian state are bigots. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=17.56s)]
*  And I can only assume he means not only the prime minister, but Benny Gantz and others [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=21.28s)]
*  as well. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=24.8s)]
*  Then our president said this about the speech. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=26.12s)]
*  To our friends in the international community, I say, is your memory so short, so quickly [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=33.160000000000004s)]
*  you forgot about October 7th, the worst massacre committed against Jews since the Holocaust? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=39.46s)]
*  So quickly you are ready to deny Israel right to defend itself against the monsters of Hamas? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=46.56s)]
*  Clearly not our president. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=53.08s)]
*  But what our president said is he thought that it was a good speech and that he spoke [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=54.199999999999996s)]
*  for a lot of people. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=57.14s)]
*  That is Prime Minister Netanyahu's reaction this morning saying, have you already forgotten? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=58.199999999999996s)]
*  Does the president think that Benjamin Netanyahu is a bigot, that he's an impediment to peace, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=62.28s)]
*  that he should be lumped in with Hamas? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=66.96s)]
*  These are two men leaders that have known each other a long time, Shannon, and they [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=68.6s)]
*  don't agree on everything, haven't over 40 years. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=72.64s)]
*  And there are certain aspects to the prosecution of operations in Gaza where we obviously don't [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=75.88s)]
*  agree with everything that Israel has done, but they have a relationship where they can [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=80.92s)]
*  talk to one another, and they do, and they will again. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=84.52000000000001s)]
*  He is the prime minister of Israel. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=87.76s)]
*  We respect the sovereignty of the Israeli people. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=89.72000000000001s)]
*  But does the president who called that speech a good speech agree there need to be new elections, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=91.84s)]
*  that he shouldn't be the prime minister? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=95.52000000000001s)]
*  The president believes it's up to the Israeli people and the Israeli government to determine [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  if and when there's going to be new elections. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=100.36000000000001s)]
*  But he does, as he said shortly after leader Schumer's very passionate speech. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=102.12s)]
*  He recognizes that the leader was speaking for a lot of Americans who feel the same way [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=107.68s)]
*  about the way the war is going. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=111.04s)]
*  We also have concerns about some of the operations and how they're being conducted. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=113.08000000000001s)]
*  We need to make sure that civilians are protected and secured, that civilian casualties come [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=116.48s)]
*  down, that more trucks and assistance get in. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  And of course, we're still working on that temporary ceasefire to get all those hostages [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=123.06s)]
*  out. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=126.52000000000001s)]
*  Okay, so the president also said this week that there would be a red line. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  He would consider Israel crossing if they went ahead with this invasion into Ra'aifa, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=130.0s)]
*  which they say they're going to do. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=133.44s)]
*  I know there's been some quantifying of that saying if there is an escape route for civilians, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=135.20000000000002s)]
*  that's part of the issue. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=140.72s)]
*  But if you consider that Israel is crossing a red line, what does that then mean? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=141.88s)]
*  Do we pull aid? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=146.6s)]
*  Do we pull weapons? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=147.68s)]
*  What does the president mean on the other side of that red line? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=149.72s)]
*  I don't want to get ahead of where we are right now or engage in hypothetical Shannon. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=151.44s)]
*  But he did say that. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=155.44s)]
*  Absolutely he did. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=157.76s)]
*  And what he's talking about is what we've been saying now for a while. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=158.76s)]
*  We understand the need to go after Hamas. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=162.06s)]
*  We understand that there are Hamas brigades in Ra'aifa and certainly represent a viable [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=163.85999999999999s)]
*  threat to Israel and to the Israeli people. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=168.54s)]
*  But what we've said is we will not support, cannot support an operation in Ra'aifa that [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=171.18s)]
*  doesn't have an executable, verifiable, achievable plan to take care of the 1.5 million people [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=175.5s)]
*  that are trying to find refuge in Ra'aifa. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=182.38s)]
*  People by the way that were pushed into Ra'aifa from Qanunis a few weeks ago and even further [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=184.48s)]
*  north from in Gaza City when the operations were there. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=189.68s)]
*  They have to be accounted for. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=192.94s)]
*  Now the Israelis will tell you they've got a plan for that, the evacuation they call [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=194.1s)]
*  it, humanitarian islands. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=197.22s)]
*  And we welcome any credible plan to take care of them but we haven't seen it yet. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=199.66s)]
*  Have you seen that? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=204.14s)]
*  We haven't seen it yet. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=205.14s)]
*  Do you expect to get one before the offensive starts? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=206.14s)]
*  We would certainly welcome the opportunity to get a look at what their plans are before [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=207.46s)]
*  they move into Ra'aifa. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=212.1s)]
*  And I think it's important for your viewers to understand they have not done that yet. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=213.1s)]
*  They have not moved into Ra'aifa. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=216.14s)]
*  Right, correct. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=218.22s)]
*  Okay they say it could take a matter of weeks that it could commence sooner rather than [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=219.22s)]
*  later. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=222.82s)]
*  That's coming from the prime minister this morning. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=223.82s)]
*  There's also this issue of the peer that we're trying to build in Gaza to get aid in. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=225.3s)]
*  Pentagon says about a thousand US troops could be involved with that. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=229.54s)]
*  The question is as we've said no US troops will go into Gaza. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=233.1s)]
*  That's mighty close. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=236.38s)]
*  And so there are questions about their safety and also what happens to the aid once it gets [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=237.62s)]
*  unloaded. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=241.42s)]
*  Here's Senator Marco Rubio worried about that. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=242.42s)]
*  The only people on the ground with any organization to distribute things are Hamas. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=246.62s)]
*  So in essence can they guarantee that we're going to go through all this trouble, put [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=250.58s)]
*  American lives on the line just so aid can be distributed to Hamas who in turn will then [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=253.46s)]
*  control it like they've controlled everything. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=258.48s)]
*  So what are the guarantees that the US troops don't get involved and that Hamas doesn't [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=261.1s)]
*  take everything that unloads off that pier? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=264.46s)]
*  Well in all fairness and with respect to the senator, Hamas isn't the only group distributing [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=266.38s)]
*  aid. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=271.68s)]
*  There are many aid organizations on the ground that are helping with the distribution of [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=272.68s)]
*  food, water, medicine. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=277.04s)]
*  But fair to say they get their hands on things. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=278.44s)]
*  We have been watching this very closely and we haven't seen evidence that Hamas has pilfered [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=281.22s)]
*  off a lot of the humanitarian assistance in a nefarious way. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=285.68s)]
*  Nobody's making excuses for them or what they've done to Gaza and the Gazan people and how [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=289.8s)]
*  they put the Gazan people at risk or how they certainly put the Israeli people at risk. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=294.52s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=298.2s)]
*  But there are other organizations that are doing that. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=299.2s)]
*  I would tell you we're still working out the details of exactly how the pier is going to [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=301.71999999999997s)]
*  operate, the modalities of it and how the assistance is going to get from the temporary [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=305.8s)]
*  pier, this offshore pier to the beach. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=309.91999999999996s)]
*  Obviously we're still going to need ground transportation and we're working our way through [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=314.2s)]
*  that right now. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=317.47999999999996s)]
*  I want to get to another hot spot internationally. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=318.47999999999996s)]
*  The US signed on to a warning to Iran this week about ballistic missiles and armaments [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=321.12s)]
*  flowing from Iran into Russia and its efforts against Ukraine. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=325.2s)]
*  As we get word this morning that Russians say that they've taken another key area in [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=329.84000000000003s)]
*  Ukraine, a small area in the Zeparitse region. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=333.52000000000004s)]
*  So it's a difficult stalemate at best there. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=337.2s)]
*  Now Iran playing into this. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=340.32s)]
*  Talk of more sanctions there, but there are a couple of authors with a new book out talking [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=342.90000000000003s)]
*  about how sanctions actually work in Iran. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=346.92s)]
*  They say that rather than hurting the Iranian regime leaders, sanctions have strengthened [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=348.64s)]
*  the Iranian state and military and ended up hurting the exact people they're supposed [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=352.76s)]
*  to be helping. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=356.68s)]
*  We are working really hard to make sure that the sanctions don't hurt the Iranian people. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=357.68s)]
*  One of the things that we talked about earlier this week was yet another, an update or a [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=361.44s)]
*  renewal of the sanctions relief package that allows Iraq for instance to get electricity [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=366.28000000000003s)]
*  from Iran because the Iraqi people are still dependent on Iran for energy. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=370.96000000000004s)]
*  And plenty of critics of that, but we won't go down that rabbit trail. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=374.64s)]
*  I understand that, but the point I'm trying to make is that that sanctions relief doesn't [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=377.16s)]
*  go to the mullahs, it doesn't go to the regime, it does go to the Iranian people. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=382.44s)]
*  So we are working hard to make sure that as we employ economic measures against the regime, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=386.32s)]
*  that we're not punishing the Iranian people. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=392.08s)]
*  We don't have a beef with the Iranian people. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=393.68s)]
*  It is with the IRGC, it is with the Supreme Leader, it's with the mullahs who continue [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=395.2s)]
*  to fund and support and resource terrorist groups throughout the region. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=399.32s)]
*  So to give a little bit more information, Russian Defense Ministry is claiming that [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=402.36s)]
*  they have captured the village of Miron in the Zaporochi region. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=405.88s)]
*  This follows news just weeks ago of another area that was reclaimed by Russia. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=410.03999999999996s)]
*  So where are we? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=414.64000000000004s)]
*  So you called it a stalemate a little bit ago, and I think I'd push back a little bit on that. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=416.64000000000004s)]
*  What we're seeing the Russians do, they got Avdiivka and the Donbas, and most of their [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=421.12s)]
*  effort has been in the east, the Donbas area. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=424.84000000000003s)]
*  You talked about this town in Zaporochi, which is clearly more to the south. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=427.04s)]
*  But they are pushing west from Avdiivka. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=430.72s)]
*  The Ukrainians have about three lines of defense. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=432.8s)]
*  The Russians are pushing up against that first one and trying to get to that second one. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=435.32000000000005s)]
*  They're taking small towns and villages and farmland, not so much because it's strategically [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=439.0s)]
*  valuable, but because they want to show wins, particularly now with the election this [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=443.40000000000003s)]
*  weekend, they want to show that they're on the move. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=446.64s)]
*  But they are physically on the move slowly. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=448.40000000000003s)]
*  But they are because the Ukrainians don't have the artillery ammunition and the other [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=450.76s)]
*  capabilities they need to push back on the Russians and to take that ground back. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=456.0s)]
*  That's why it's so critical, Shannon, that we get this supplemental funding that the [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=459.88s)]
*  Ukrainian commanders on the battlefield are literally making life and death decisions [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=464.04s)]
*  about whether they will fire back or won't, whether they'll move back because they're [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=468.36s)]
*  running out of ammunition, not courage, not leadership, not skill. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=472.16s)]
*  They're running out of ammunition. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=476.20000000000005s)]
*  So we're going to talk to Congressman McCaul up next about that and about what's potentially [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=477.20000000000005s)]
*  coming out of the House. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=480.64000000000004s)]
*  But just very quickly, would the White House sign off on standalone measures, say, just [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=481.64000000000004s)]
*  aid for Ukraine, just aid for Israel? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=485.04s)]
*  I don't want to get ahead of the president and his decision-making process, but we want [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=486.76000000000005s)]
*  that supplemental funding for Ukraine. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=490.24s)]
*  They desperately need it. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=492.0s)]
*  Time is not on their side. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=493.28000000000003s)]
*  It's not on our side either. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=494.76000000000005s)]
*  All right, Admiral, always good to see you and happy St. Patrick's Day. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMVS-DSzTwI&t=495.76000000000005s)]
