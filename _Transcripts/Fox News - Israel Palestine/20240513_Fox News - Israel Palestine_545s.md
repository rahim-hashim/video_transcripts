# Is President Biden playing 'political games' with ally Israel?
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [May 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8)
*  Good evening and thank you for joining us. I'm Trey Gowdy and it's Sunday night in America. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel is moving into Rafa despite threats from the Biden administration. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=4.72s)]
*  As attempts by Hamas to negotiate are seen as a ploy to delay the Israeli offensive. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  Hamas still holds hostages, so if that group were really serious about a ceasefire, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  releasing hostages might be a good first step. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=21.2s)]
*  Meanwhile, college campuses remain chaotic crime scenes. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=24.64s)]
*  That doesn't bother the squad. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=28.88s)]
*  Per usual, they side with the criminals and not the cops. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=30.96s)]
*  From GWU to Wash U and everywhere else, students have been violently beaten without provocation. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=34.96s)]
*  They have been arrested and charged with disproportionate offenses. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=43.2s)]
*  They have been wrongfully smeared as anti-Semitic. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=46.64s)]
*  This is an explicit attempt to repress students exercising their First Amendment rights to [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=50.56s)]
*  protest their universities complicit actions on behalf of the Israeli government's genocide of [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=55.68s)]
*  Palestinians. The squad remains a little out of step with President Biden, but honestly, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=63.36s)]
*  he can be hard to pin down on exactly what his position is. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=70.64s)]
*  Violence attacks, destroying property, is not peaceful protest. It's against the law. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=75.36s)]
*  And we are not a lawless country. We're a civil society. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=82.39999999999999s)]
*  We uphold the rule of law. And no one should have to hide or be brave just to be themselves. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=86.88s)]
*  He condemns violence, but he also condemns Israel, the lone democracy in the region [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=99.44s)]
*  actually seeking to deter more violence. Biden needs young voters to win, but he also knows [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=104.64s)]
*  images of lawlessness don't really appeal to undecided voters or really anyone other than [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=110.16s)]
*  anarchists. Moreover, Biden is threatening to withhold arms and munitions from Israel, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=115.52s)]
*  but is willing to negotiate with Iran. The world has truly turned upside down. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=120.72s)]
*  Joining us are Brooke Goldstein, the director of the Lawfare Project, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=127.6s)]
*  and Morgan Ortegas, who worked for the State Department and the Trump administration. Welcome [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=131.04s)]
*  to you both. Brooke, is Joe Biden really withholding arms and munitions from one of [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=135.28s)]
*  our most treasured and reliable allies in Israel? It looks like that's exactly what he's doing, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=139.83999999999997s)]
*  and it's just absurd because if you take a look at his foreign policy, it is Biden that is [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=147.04s)]
*  endangering this world. It is Biden, as you said earlier, that encouraged Iran by welcoming them [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=154.39999999999998s)]
*  into the nuclear deal. It is Biden that released over $10 billion to Iran, the number one sponsor [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=163.2s)]
*  of Hamas, only one month after Iran facilitated the October 7th attack. It is Biden who continues [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  to supply Hamas with so-called humanitarian aid, which is really food and fuel for the terrorist [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=179.92s)]
*  organization. It is Biden who gives Qatar a privileged status in this country and has [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=187.2s)]
*  allowed Qatar to fund to the tune of billions of dollars, the greatest influence campaign, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=192.95999999999998s)]
*  subversive influence campaign this country has ever seen. And I'm very happy to see that the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=200.32s)]
*  House Oversight Committee has launched an investigation into President Biden and why [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  he is playing such dangerous political games with our only ally in the Middle East who is [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=211.83999999999997s)]
*  on the front lines of the war against radical Islamist terrorism. Morgan, I hate to be cynical, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=216.88s)]
*  but I think I know why Biden is playing these games. He needs young voters to get enthused [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=225.2s)]
*  about November, but he also needs undecided voters and moderates who are actually really [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=229.2s)]
*  turned off by the violence and the support for terrorist organizations and the anti-Semitism [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=233.84s)]
*  on college campuses. So he's kind of torn a little bit, I guess, politically. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=238.4s)]
*  You know, Trey, this is what happens when your campaign team runs your foreign policy in the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=242.88s)]
*  White House. That's not something that we chose to do in the Trump administration. In fact, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=249.51999999999998s)]
*  when your and my friend Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made the decision to take out [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=253.92s)]
*  Qassem Soleimani, we knew that we were likely going to get grief from all sectors of the world, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=257.92s)]
*  certainly from critics here at home. But we did it because we knew it would be the right decision. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=262.96s)]
*  We also knew that there could be plenty of problems with that operation, yet we move forward. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=267.84s)]
*  You know, if we boil this all down and we look at it, what President Biden is saying and his team [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=273.28s)]
*  is saying is they want to destroy Hamas, they want Israel to destroy Hamas, they want the hostages [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=278.08s)]
*  back. But basically, they're going to tie both of Israel's hands, not just one, they're going to [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=283.44s)]
*  tie both of their hands behind their back as they try to get those four remaining battalions in [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=287.91999999999996s)]
*  Now, listen, I have been in government in and out of government since 2007. I have a master's [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=294.0s)]
*  thesis from Johns Hopkins on counterinsurgency. I have yet to see the Biden team offer up what this [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=298.8s)]
*  new plan for counterterrorism, urban warfare is that the Israelis are supposed to impose. You know, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=304.16s)]
*  they say that there's a better way to kill Hamas, to defeat Hamas than going into RAFA. I would love [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=310.32s)]
*  to hear what that plan is from the administration. That probably represents some sort of new era of [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=316.16s)]
*  urban warfare encounter insurgency that we haven't seen for the last 20 years. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=321.03999999999996s)]
*  I think probably more likely that there aren't these solutions actually that the Biden team is [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=325.03999999999996s)]
*  referring to because we know Israel is going above and beyond in this combat situation where Hamas [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=329.84s)]
*  does not wear uniforms. They hide behind their own women and children and they hide behind hostages. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=335.68s)]
*  So they need to do what I called on them to do at a month ago, which is to ignore President Biden [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=341.28s)]
*  and finish the job. And you know what? They're not going to be doing it alone because there's [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=345.84s)]
*  going to be plenty of us here at home that will support them no matter what. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=349.2s)]
*  Brooke, to that point, how does Israel play this out? I mean, that country needs to do what it has [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=354.64s)]
*  to do for security purposes. I mean, they're surrounded by either neighbors who desire their [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=359.68s)]
*  non-existence or neighbors who are agnostic, but they don't want too much daylight between [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=365.59999999999997s)]
*  that nation and the United States. So how do they play this out? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=370.8s)]
*  Well, you know, I want to say to the prior point, there really is a very easy solution to this, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=374.32s)]
*  and the United States has blocked it at every step. It's the humanitarian relocation of the citizens, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=380.32s)]
*  the Gazan citizens that are in Ra'afah. I know that Israel has asked for them to be relocated [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=388.32s)]
*  and America has refused. Does the Biden administration want to see these Gazans being [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=393.76s)]
*  used as human shields by Hamas? Does the Biden administration even want Israel to win? And what [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=400.72s)]
*  is the Biden administration doing with someone like Mahar Bittar as a national security advisor? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=407.04s)]
*  This is a gentleman who worked for the criminal organization, UNRWA, the United Nations Relief [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=414.96000000000004s)]
*  Works Agency, that we know is currently embedded with Hamas using Palestinians as human shields. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=420.8s)]
*  Mahar Bittar also worked on the, I believe it was the executive board of the so-called [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=427.91999999999996s)]
*  Students for Justice in Palestine, which is now one of the organizers of the unlawful pro-terror [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=433.67999999999995s)]
*  encampments and protests that are happening throughout the country. So really, who is it [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=441.03999999999996s)]
*  that is dictating our foreign policy and is it being done in the interests of American national [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=445.84s)]
*  security or not? Morgan, before I let you go, the squad never met a crime they couldn't excuse, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=451.92s)]
*  except maybe possibly mislabeling business expenses. That's apparently where they draw the [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=459.12s)]
*  line. I think the more American people watch people like Cory Bush and Rashida Tlaib, the more [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=464.24s)]
*  they're not going to vote for that party come November. I'll give you the last word. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=470.24s)]
*  I mean, I hope that's true because if they do vote for that in November, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=475.68s)]
*  then they're normalizing Jewish students in America being unable to walk, you know, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=479.28s)]
*  from the cafeteria to their next class. You know, we should never have in this country [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=484.23999999999995s)]
*  where a religious or an ethnic minority is unable to freely go about their business on a college [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=488.96s)]
*  campus for fear of getting injured, for fear of what will happen to them from the mobs. Certainly, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=494.79999999999995s)]
*  these college administrators need to do more. But you know what? So does this administration. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=501.03999999999996s)]
*  You can't tell me that if this happened to anybody else, that the Biden administration [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=505.28s)]
*  would take 10 days to issue a statement or to say something publicly condemning them, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=508.8s)]
*  which is what the president did. We should and expect more from our leaders. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=513.92s)]
*  Well, when Biden comes up with a nice form of warfare, I will have you back on so he can tell [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=519.92s)]
*  us how to engage in war with a terrorist group and do so in a really nice way. Thank you both [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=525.6s)]
*  for joining us on a Sunday night. Thank you. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGvbW7LAPS8&t=530.8s)]
