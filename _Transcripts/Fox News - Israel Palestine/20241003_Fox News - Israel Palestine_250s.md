# This is why Netanyahu doesn't want US troops on the ground: Rep. Burchett
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg)
*  Joe Biden still isn't supporting Israel's planned attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=0.0s)]
*  Listen. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=6.0s)]
*  Would you support an attack on Iran's nuclear sites by an Israeli? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=7.0s)]
*  The answer is no. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=13.0s)]
*  And I think there's things that... [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=15.0s)]
*  We'll be discussing with the Israelis what they're going to do, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=19.0s)]
*  but all seven of us agree that they have a right to respond, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=22.0s)]
*  to respond in proportion. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=27.0s)]
*  Tennessee Congressman Tim Burchett sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=30.0s)]
*  and he joins us now. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=33.0s)]
*  Congressman, good morning to you. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=34.0s)]
*  He's calling for a proportional response. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=35.0s)]
*  I mean, if that were true, that would be 200 ballistic missiles launched into Iran targeting civilians. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=37.0s)]
*  Is that what the president means? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=43.0s)]
*  I don't think the president knows what he means when he says... [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=46.0s)]
*  He's telling Israel they can't hit Iran and their nuclear sites. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=50.0s)]
*  They're not developing nuclear energy, ma'am. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=56.0s)]
*  They're developing nuclear weapons. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=58.0s)]
*  They don't need nuclear energy. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=60.0s)]
*  They're sitting on the largest oil supplies in the entire world, frankly. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=61.0s)]
*  And I think this just shows just how out of step this administration, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=66.0s)]
*  the Harris-Biden administration is, what's going on in the Middle East. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=70.0s)]
*  This is not proportionate, and it's not strategic, what Biden's talking about. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=74.0s)]
*  That's why Netanyahu doesn't want American troops on the ground [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=79.0s)]
*  because our rules of engagement get people killed on the wrong side. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=82.0s)]
*  Congressman, did you hear about this? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=87.0s)]
*  Hamas is now saying that they're disappointed by the lack of support from Middle Eastern countries. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=88.0s)]
*  A Hamas official told NBC that the only country really supporting their resistance is Iran. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=94.0s)]
*  And if you look at statements from countries like Saudi Arabia, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=99.0s)]
*  they all express concern, but they don't outright condemn Israel. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=102.0s)]
*  What do you think that means for the future? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=106.0s)]
*  I think it means that what Netanyahu is doing is working. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=109.0s)]
*  We saw that under Trump's administration, the Abraham Accords. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=115.0s)]
*  You saw them going together against evil. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=119.0s)]
*  And this is just another example of that. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=123.0s)]
*  They're sick of it. They don't need it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=127.0s)]
*  They have to—I mean, their sworn enemies are the Jews. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=129.0s)]
*  We understand that, but they have to—and they have to say that back home. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=132.0s)]
*  But the reality is they don't want a war with Israel. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=136.0s)]
*  They want to get back to peace and make money. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=139.0s)]
*  And that's what they need to be doing. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=142.0s)]
*  And this is just—and when America sends that message out, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=144.0s)]
*  that not supporting Israel fully in the defense of their own homeland, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=147.0s)]
*  to me that just sends the wrong message throughout the world. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=152.0s)]
*  Meantime, lawmakers are investigating George Soros' unprecedented purchase of Odyssey radio stations [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=155.0s)]
*  right before the presidential election. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=161.0s)]
*  Here's the deal. 200 Odyssey stations are involved. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=163.0s)]
*  The Soros Fund invested $400 million. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=166.0s)]
*  The deal impacts 40 markets, reaching 165 million Americans. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=169.0s)]
*  Oh, and by the way, let me add, $60 million in Democrat contributions [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=173.0s)]
*  have been linked to George Soros this election season. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=177.0s)]
*  The FCC expedited its normal approval process when it comes to foreign ownership of stations. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=180.0s)]
*  Why? Why did it bend over backward for George Soros? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=187.0s)]
*  We'll give you 30 seconds to you. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=191.0s)]
*  During the Second World War, we did not allow foreign entities to own our radio systems. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=194.0s)]
*  I think this is just an extension of that. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=199.0s)]
*  You have a man that does not have America's interests at heart. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=202.0s)]
*  He wants to destroy this country. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=206.0s)]
*  And that's exactly—he is a money changer of the worst kind. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=208.0s)]
*  And he will destroy this country and the economy of it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=212.0s)]
*  And this is why, more so than ever, we need Donald Trump in the White House. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=215.0s)]
*  This kind of nonsense needs to stop. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=220.0s)]
*  I need a yes or no on this. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=223.0s)]
*  Can Oversight Committee do anything to stop this deal, or is it a fatal complaint at this point? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=224.0s)]
*  They can if the Senate will comply. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=230.0s)]
*  But the problem is Schumer's in bed with the other side. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=232.0s)]
*  Understood. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=235.0s)]
*  Congressman Tim Burchett, thank you. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=236.0s)]
*  Fox & Friends starts right now. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=237.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_cKlbACxg&t=250.0s)]
