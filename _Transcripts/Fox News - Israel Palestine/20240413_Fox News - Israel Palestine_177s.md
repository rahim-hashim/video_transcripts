# US shoots down 'dozens' of Iranian drones, ballistic missiles: Report
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4)
*  The Pentagon continues to be on high alert as Iran launches a massive drone and missile [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4&t=0.0s)]
*  attack on Israel. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4&t=4.44s)]
*  U.S. forces working in coordination with Israel to shoot down some of those drones. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4&t=5.8s)]
*  Well, dozens of drones, actually. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4&t=11.64s)]
*  Israeli forces just a few moments ago saying most of those drones were intercepted outside [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4&t=14.4s)]
*  of Israel's border. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4&t=19.76s)]
*  Joining us now is our national security correspondent, Jennifer Griffin, with the latest from the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4&t=21.76s)]
*  Pentagon. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4&t=24.88s)]
*  Jen, what do you got? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4&t=25.88s)]
*  Hi, John. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4&t=26.88s)]
*  Well, it's not just drones that have been shot down. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4&t=27.959999999999997s)]
*  As we've reported, U.S. officials tell us that the U.S. military has shot down dozens [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4&t=29.84s)]
*  of those one-way attack drones outside of Israeli airspace, but also ballistic and cruise [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4&t=35.8s)]
*  missiles. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4&t=42.0s)]
*  We have now learned that U.S. military assets in the region have been used to intercept [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4&t=43.0s)]
*  some of those ballistic and land attack cruise missiles that we reported in the last hour [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4&t=48.8s)]
*  were fired from Iran. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4&t=54.96s)]
*  So that means that Iran fired not just drones, but also ballistic and cruise missiles. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4&t=56.56s)]
*  And what's significant is that the U.S. military engaged at least one of those ballistic [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4&t=63.160000000000004s)]
*  missiles in a manner that protected Israel. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4&t=70.16s)]
*  So U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Central Command, very, very busy tonight across the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4&t=73.16s)]
*  Middle East. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4&t=79.0s)]
*  We also understand that the Jordanian Air Force and missile defense systems in Jordan [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4&t=80.0s)]
*  were very, very busy tonight. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4&t=85.46s)]
*  They have engaged, I'm also told, dozens of drones, Iranian drones that were passing [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4&t=87.05999999999999s)]
*  through their airspace. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4&t=92.94s)]
*  The IDF has been very clear that most of the drones and missiles were destroyed and intercepted [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4&t=94.66s)]
*  outside Israeli airspace. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4&t=100.46s)]
*  That's good news for Israel, and it shows the incredibly complex, layered missile defense [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4&t=102.38s)]
*  and air assets employed to engage not just these missiles and drones, but also we're [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4&t=110.13999999999999s)]
*  told that aircraft were sent by, hostile aircraft were sent by Iran toward Israel, and they [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4&t=117.33999999999999s)]
*  were all intercepted, we're told. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4&t=125.8s)]
*  So a lot of activity in the skies over the Middle East tonight, but we are getting some [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4&t=128.2s)]
*  good signs from the IDF telling Israelis that they no longer necessarily need to be in shelters. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4&t=134.92s)]
*  And so this first wave of attacks appears to be winding down, but we are told that the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4&t=143.07999999999998s)]
*  U.S. military aircraft are still in the skies patrolling, ensuring that Israel is safe tonight. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4&t=151.04s)]
*  John? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4&t=158.83999999999997s)]
*  I'm sure that's a prudent thing to do as well at this point. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4&t=159.83999999999997s)]
*  Jane Griffin for us at the Pentagon. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4&t=162.64s)]
*  Jane, thank you. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbPrbmg9U4&t=163.79999999999998s)]
