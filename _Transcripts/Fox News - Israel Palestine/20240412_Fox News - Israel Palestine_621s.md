# Iran attack reportedly imminent: ‘Never seen things so tense’
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4)
*  the White House. We're [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=0.0s)]
*  going to be right back. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=5.0s)]
*  Israel reportedly preparing [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=8.0s)]
*  for a new worst case scenario, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=11.0s)]
*  a direct attack from Iran on [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=14.0s)]
*  Israeli soil. Sources say that [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=16.0s)]
*  the strike could happen at any [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=17.0s)]
*  time within the next 48 hours. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=20.0s)]
*  Tehran is already vowed to take [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=22.0s)]

*  House is hopeful of a very [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=29.0s)]
*  public and what we consider to [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=31.0s)]
*  be a very credible threat made [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=33.0s)]
*  by Iran in terms of potential [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=35.0s)]
*  attacks on Israel and that we [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=38.0s)]
*  are in constant communication [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=41.0s)]
*  with our Israeli counterparts [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=43.0s)]

*  defend themselves against those [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=47.0s)]
*  kinds of attacks. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=49.0s)]
*  Jennifer Griffin is live at the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=51.0s)]
*  Pentagon with more. Jen? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=53.0s)]
*  Dagen, I've been covering the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=57.0s)]
*  White House, as you know, for [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=58.0s)]
*  30 years, and I have never seen [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=59.0s)]
*  things so tense with the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=61.0s)]
*  potential for a wider war to [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=63.0s)]
*  break out between Israel and [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=65.0s)]
*  Iran, which could draw the U.S. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=67.0s)]
*  and others into a wider Middle [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=69.0s)]
*  East war. Until now, the U.S. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=71.0s)]
*  has been facing Iranian [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=73.0s)]
*  proxies, but in the wake of the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=74.0s)]
*  Israeli airstrike on April 1st [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=76.0s)]
*  in Damascus that killed the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=78.0s)]
*  Iranian Revolutionary Guard [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=80.0s)]
*  General and six other top [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=81.0s)]
*  Iranian commanders responsible [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=83.0s)]
*  for arming Iran's proxy groups, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=85.0s)]
*  the U.S. has been able to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=87.0s)]
*  avenge that attack with a [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=88.0s)]
*  massive show of force targeting [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=90.0s)]
*  Israeli territory. In recent [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=92.0s)]
*  days, the U.S. has [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=94.0s)]
*  prepositioned additional [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=95.0s)]
*  military assets in the region. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=96.0s)]
*  The attacks by the Houthis [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=98.0s)]
*  supported by Iran continue to [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=100.0s)]
*  threaten U.S. ships in the Red [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=102.0s)]
*  Sea. Tensions are at an all-time [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=104.0s)]
*  high. U.S. officials tell me [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=106.0s)]
*  that they have seen movements [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=107.0s)]
*  suggesting that Iranian [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=109.0s)]
*  ballistic missiles could launch [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=110.0s)]
*  any day. Israeli warplanes are [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=112.0s)]
*  patrolling the skies along the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=114.0s)]
*  coast of the Middle East. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=116.0s)]
*  The U.S. military has been put [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=117.0s)]
*  on high alert for a massive [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=119.0s)]
*  missile and drone strike that is [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=121.0s)]
*  expected to emanate from Iran. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=123.0s)]
*  The U.S. embassy told Americans [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=125.0s)]
*  who work for the embassy not to [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=127.0s)]
*  leave Tel Aviv, Jerusalem or [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=129.0s)]
*  Beersheba and to avoid travel to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=131.0s)]
*  the north or south of Israel. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=133.0s)]
*  The head of U.S. Central Command [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=135.0s)]
*  General Eric Carilla was in [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=137.0s)]
*  Israel to meet with Israel's [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=139.0s)]
*  minister of defense, Yoav [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=141.0s)]
*  Gallant, who praised General [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=143.0s)]
*  Gallant's efforts to protect [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=145.0s)]
*  Israeli defense counterparts on [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=147.0s)]
*  the latest intelligence and is [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=149.0s)]
*  still in the region. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=151.0s)]
*  We're comfortable with the way [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=153.0s)]
*  we have communicated the reality [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=156.0s)]
*  of this threat and the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=159.0s)]
*  conversations that we're having [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=161.0s)]
*  with Israel. What we are not [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=163.0s)]
*  going to sit back and be [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=165.0s)]
*  comfortable on is knowing [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=167.0s)]
*  exactly what this is going to [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=169.0s)]
*  look like. And that's why we are [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=171.0s)]
*  comfortable with the way that [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=173.0s)]
*  Israel has what it needs to [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=175.0s)]
*  defend itself. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=177.0s)]
*  What's unusual is for Iran to [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=179.0s)]
*  telegraph its response. It [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=181.0s)]
*  usually relies on proxies and [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=183.0s)]
*  terrorism. With the U.S. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=185.0s)]
*  releasing what is clearly very [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=187.0s)]
*  specific intelligence, you can't [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=189.0s)]
*  rule out that Iran will look for [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=191.0s)]
*  an off-ramp to avoid a war that [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=193.0s)]
*  could draw in U.S. forces. All [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=195.0s)]
*  eyes now on the supreme leader, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=197.0s)]
*  Ayatollah Khamenei. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=199.0s)]
*  We've just received a statement [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=201.0s)]
*  from CIA director Bill Burns, an [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=203.0s)]
*  urgent statement about the 702 [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=205.0s)]
*  FISA vote that is upcoming. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=207.0s)]
*  And he explained how crucial [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=209.0s)]
*  this 702 war basically to renew [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=211.0s)]
*  it is for the U.S. intelligence [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=213.0s)]
*  community. He said that they [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=215.0s)]
*  would not be able to track the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=217.0s)]
*  Chinese networks that bring [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=219.0s)]
*  fentanyl through Mexico and up [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=221.0s)]
*  through the border into the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=223.0s)]
*  United States. They could not [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=225.0s)]
*  have killed al-Qaeda leader [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=227.0s)]
*  Al-Munal al-Zawahiri. They could [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=229.0s)]
*  not have stopped or found the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=231.0s)]
*  network that attacked the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=233.0s)]
*  colonial pipeline. So this 702 [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=235.0s)]
*  legislation needs to be renewed [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=237.0s)]
*  and without any amendments or [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=239.0s)]
*  warrants because it would be so [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=241.0s)]
*  dangerous otherwise. Dagan. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=243.0s)]
*  Thank you so much, Jennifer [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=245.0s)]
*  Griffin, at the Pentagon. Paul, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=247.0s)]
*  to you first on this, Jennifer [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=249.0s)]
*  mentioned China. The United [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=251.0s)]
*  States is essentially bank [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=253.0s)]
*  rolling Iran's military [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=255.0s)]
*  because Joe Biden and company [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=257.0s)]
*  have not done everything in [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=259.0s)]
*  their power to drive down the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=261.0s)]
*  price of oil and to stop the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=263.0s)]
*  export of Iranian oil, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=265.0s)]
*  particularly to China. We have [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=267.0s)]
*  not even sanctioned Chinese [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=269.0s)]
*  buyers of Iranian oil, which [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=271.0s)]
*  the Republicans in the House have [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=273.0s)]
*  tried to do. Yeah. And we also [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=275.0s)]
*  sent them pallets of cash, right? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=277.0s)]
*  So we haven't made Iran feel any [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=279.0s)]
*  of the real pain here. And I'm [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=281.0s)]
*  going to go back to what I would [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=283.0s)]
*  like to say. So we have [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=285.0s)]
*  taken a step back and [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=287.0s)]
*  operated essentially through the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=289.0s)]
*  media and through pronouncements [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=291.0s)]
*  at the same time. The Hamas [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=293.0s)]
*  leadership resides in what is [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=295.0s)]
*  nominally an American ally [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=297.0s)]
*  cutter, and we have left their [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=299.0s)]
*  operational control command and [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=301.0s)]
*  control in place. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=303.0s)]
*  Where is the case on them? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=305.0s)]
*  Hamas is a designated terrorist [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=307.0s)]
*  group. Why aren't we treating [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=309.0s)]
*  them the way we treated ISIS, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=311.0s)]
*  Al Qaeda and everybody else? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=313.0s)]
*  Indict the leadership, tell Cutter, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=315.0s)]
*  get them on the tarmac in JFK tomorrow. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=317.0s)]
*  Otherwise, you know what? You're going to have a [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=319.0s)]
*  problem with us because they have [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=321.0s)]
*  five, four or five major American [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=323.0s)]
*  University campuses there. We have [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=325.0s)]
*  a major military base. Our biggest [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=327.0s)]
*  one in the Middle East is in Cutter. We have [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=329.0s)]
*  plenty of leverage there. We haven't used [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=331.0s)]
*  it, and it's one of the reasons why Iran is so [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=333.0s)]
*  empowered. The Wall Street Journal today [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=335.0s)]
*  Emily writes, Biden remembers [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=337.0s)]
*  that Iran is listening, and they say [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=339.0s)]
*  the following. Abandoning an ally [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=341.0s)]
*  in wartime is an invitation [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=343.0s)]
*  to its enemies. And in essence, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=345.0s)]
*  that's what Biden and the Democrats [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=347.0s)]
*  have done or started to do to [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=349.0s)]
*  Israel in recent weeks. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=351.0s)]
*  He threatened to withdraw support Biden [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=353.0s)]
*  did for the Israeli war effort. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=355.0s)]
*  You had 40 and up to [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=357.0s)]
*  56 House Democrats [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=359.0s)]
*  threatening to cut off weapons [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=361.0s)]
*  to Israel. And what [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=363.0s)]
*  happens? Well, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=365.0s)]
*  Iran is emboldened. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=367.0s)]
*  That's right. We demonstrated to the world [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=369.0s)]
*  how Biden responds and [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=371.0s)]
*  behaves to our allies in Afghanistan. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=373.0s)]
*  We set the [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=375.0s)]
*  plate. We set the table right then. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=377.0s)]
*  The reason that, as Jennifer Griffin [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=379.0s)]
*  frighteningly points out, that we are [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=381.0s)]
*  the closest to a Middle East war than we've been [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=383.0s)]
*  in decades is because there's been a failure of [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=385.0s)]
*  deterrence because our president [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=387.0s)]
*  has a fear of escalation that has [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=389.0s)]
*  eclipped any show of strength. When [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=391.0s)]
*  you have a leader in the [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=393.0s)]
*  Oval Office that has no backbone, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=395.0s)]
*  that is afraid of ruffling feathers [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=397.0s)]
*  throughout the globe and throughout the Middle East, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=399.0s)]
*  that is afraid of showing support for allies [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=401.0s)]
*  rather than in [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=403.0s)]
*  exchange for capitulating to enemies [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=405.0s)]
*  essentially, this is what happens. The fact that it's [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=407.0s)]
*  in the Supreme Ayatollah's [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=409.0s)]
*  court right now and he's making a decision [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=411.0s)]
*  on what exactly to do, it shouldn't have gotten that [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=413.0s)]
*  far. If you're in a bar and you see a [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=415.0s)]
*  really big guy with spikes on his [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=417.0s)]
*  you're not even going to get to the point [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=419.0s)]
*  of talking smack to him. You are [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=421.0s)]
*  deterred. The globe right now is on [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=423.0s)]
*  the brink because this person in our [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=425.0s)]
*  Oval Office has not made it clear [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=427.0s)]
*  what would happen if things happen to [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=429.0s)]
*  our allies or should I say maybe he's [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=431.0s)]
*  made it clear what will happen, which is nothing. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=433.0s)]
*  Oil is up so far this [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=437.0s)]
*  year. It's soaring today [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=439.0s)]
*  up about 20%. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=441.0s)]
*  That's enriching Iran. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=443.0s)]
*  It is giving Iran [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=445.0s)]
*  more money to fund [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=447.0s)]
*  terrorism and fund its [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=449.0s)]
*  proxies and if this administration [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=451.0s)]
*  is not doing everything to drive down [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=453.0s)]
*  the price of oil and cut off oil coming [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=455.0s)]
*  out of Iran, again, we're funding [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=457.0s)]
*  as a nation those [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=459.0s)]
*  very terrorism and the death of Americans. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=461.0s)]
*  Yeah, but I mean Joe Biden has [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=463.0s)]
*  thrown Israel to the wolves over a few [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=465.0s)]
*  votes in Michigan. So like what [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=467.0s)]
*  do you think we're expecting a little too much [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=469.0s)]
*  from this man? I mean ask yourself, when you [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=471.0s)]
*  hear Joe Biden speak, does he project [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=473.0s)]
*  strength? No. You're like I've interviewed [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=475.0s)]
*  a lot of generals, intelligence [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=477.0s)]
*  officers, foreign policy experts [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=479.0s)]
*  from my podcast, The Truth with Lisa Booth, and the one [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=481.0s)]
*  takeaway you'll get is that a lot of [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=483.0s)]
*  foreign policy comes down to human nature. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=485.0s)]
*  Right? It's that playground mentality, particularly [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=487.0s)]
*  when you're dealing with the authoritarians [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=489.0s)]
*  and terrorists. It's a show of strength. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=491.0s)]
*  And we went from being the big guy [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=493.0s)]
*  on the playground that people were afraid to under [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=495.0s)]
*  Donald Trump to getting our lunch money [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=497.0s)]
*  stolen and stuffed into a locker [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=499.0s)]
*  under Joe Biden. And [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=501.0s)]
*  so the only way to bring peace and stability to [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=503.0s)]
*  the world again is electing Donald Trump. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=505.0s)]
*  And we were told the guy couldn't be trusted with the nuclear [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=507.0s)]
*  codes. Now he's the only one we can trust. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=509.0s)]
*  You know? And so that's the [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=511.0s)]
*  only path forward. I mean everything that [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=513.0s)]
*  guy did was a show of force, whether [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=515.0s)]
*  it's taking out Qasem Soleimani, sending [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=517.0s)]
*  those 59 Tomahawk missiles to Syria, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=519.0s)]
*  the mother of all bombs the list goes on. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=521.0s)]
*  So that's the only way to get peace [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=523.0s)]
*  and stability back into the world. Yeah. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=525.0s)]
*  Carly. Yeah, I mean [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=527.0s)]
*  this is significant for several reasons. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=529.0s)]
*  One of them is that it's [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=531.0s)]
*  expected to be a direct attack from [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=533.0s)]
*  Iran, not an Iranian proxy. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=535.0s)]
*  And why does that? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=537.0s)]
*  What does that mean for the United States? Well, there are a [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=539.0s)]
*  lot of American citizens still living in [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=541.0s)]
*  Israel. So what happens [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=543.0s)]
*  if American lives are lost [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=545.0s)]
*  in this expected [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=547.0s)]
*  attack? Where does [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=549.0s)]
*  that put us in terms of escalation [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=551.0s)]
*  between the United States and [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=553.0s)]
*  Iran? What will that mean in terms of [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=555.0s)]
*  the future of the war? So [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=557.0s)]
*  that is different. That could potentially [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=559.0s)]
*  be an escalation. In many ways [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=561.0s)]
*  though, the situation is somewhat [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=563.0s)]
*  more of the same because Iran [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=565.0s)]
*  already funds Hamas and Hezbollah, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=567.0s)]
*  two terror groups that are already [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=569.0s)]
*  fighting in Israel right [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=571.0s)]
*  now. And that is one of the [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=573.0s)]
*  main reasons why stopping [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=575.0s)]
*  the sanctions against Iran and [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=577.0s)]
*  taking the foot off the [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=579.0s)]
*  gas of the maximum pressure campaign was such [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=581.0s)]
*  a grave mistake. We have [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=583.0s)]
*  remember Hamas has Americans. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=585.0s)]
*  Yeah. And Iran knows that [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=587.0s)]
*  and they've seen our response. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=589.0s)]
*  So that's [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=591.0s)]
*  Biden's policy. Money to [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=593.0s)]
*  Iran and [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=595.0s)]
*  refuse to change course even [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=597.0s)]
*  when US troops suffer traumatic brain [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=599.0s)]
*  injuries or are killed [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=601.0s)]
*  for more than three years. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNpv8lM5Nr4&t=603.0s)]
