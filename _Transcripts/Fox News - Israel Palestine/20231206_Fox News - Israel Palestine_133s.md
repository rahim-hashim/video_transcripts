# IDF spokesperson: This is an urgent call for action
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJevwJPVYy4)
*  President Biden now calling for a global condemnation against Hamas for the sexual violence committed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJevwJPVYy4&t=0.0s)]
*  against Israelis. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJevwJPVYy4&t=7.36s)]
*  It all comes after the Israeli Air Force continues fighting along the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJevwJPVYy4&t=8.36s)]
*  Trey Yanks is live in southern Israel with the very latest for us this morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJevwJPVYy4&t=12.6s)]
*  Hi Trey. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJevwJPVYy4&t=16.04s)]
*  Hey Todd Carley, good morning. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJevwJPVYy4&t=17.04s)]
*  Israeli forces are ramping up their strikes across the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJevwJPVYy4&t=20.62s)]
*  They say they hit 250 targets over the past 24 hours. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJevwJPVYy4&t=23.96s)]
*  The Israelis are continuing to locate weapons, storage facilities, explosives and entrances [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJevwJPVYy4&t=28.96s)]
*  to tunnels. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJevwJPVYy4&t=34.04s)]
*  We also know they're targeting launching sites responsible for a number of rocket barrages [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJevwJPVYy4&t=35.04s)]
*  that took place as recently as yesterday targeting Israel's second largest city of Tel Aviv. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJevwJPVYy4&t=39.72s)]
*  Inside Gaza, the death toll does continue to rise and Israeli strike against Deir al-Bala [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJevwJPVYy4&t=45.44s)]
*  in central Gaza killed multiple Palestinians yesterday. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJevwJPVYy4&t=50.0s)]
*  We also know you can see here from the destruction in Gaza's second largest city of Hanunis, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJevwJPVYy4&t=53.32s)]
*  Israeli forces are operating throughout that area as they continue to go after Hamas leadership. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJevwJPVYy4&t=58.68s)]
*  Now as the war rages on, Israel is still gathering intelligence on the hostages still held inside [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJevwJPVYy4&t=63.88s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJevwJPVYy4&t=68.72s)]
*  Rear Admiral Daniel Higary says 138 people are currently being held by Hamas. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJevwJPVYy4&t=69.72s)]
*  He added this in a statement this morning. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJevwJPVYy4&t=74.36s)]
*  I can say with absolute certainty every minute in Hamas captivity endangers their lives. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJevwJPVYy4&t=76.64s)]
*  This is an urgent call for action. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJevwJPVYy4&t=85.56s)]
*  The international community must take action. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJevwJPVYy4&t=88.24s)]
*  The Red Cross must have access to the hostages that are in the hands of Hamas. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJevwJPVYy4&t=91.36s)]
*  We just got finished interviewing a man who had two of his sisters held by him. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJevwJPVYy4&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  Hamas, his brother-in-law, is currently still inside Gaza. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJevwJPVYy4&t=104.84s)]
*  And you really just got a sense of what it is like for the families more than 60 days [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJevwJPVYy4&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  into this conflict, many of whom still don't have answers about their loved ones. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJevwJPVYy4&t=112.56s)]
*  Todd Carley? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJevwJPVYy4&t=116.72s)]
*  A lot of these families describe this as one continuous long day. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJevwJPVYy4&t=117.92s)]
*  No day they're not sleeping, they're not eating because they're so worried about their loved [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJevwJPVYy4&t=122.56s)]
*  ones that we need to get them back home. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJevwJPVYy4&t=126.36s)]
*  138 of them. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJevwJPVYy4&t=128.48s)]
*  Trey Yanks live for us in southern Israel. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJevwJPVYy4&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJevwJPVYy4&t=131.36s)]
