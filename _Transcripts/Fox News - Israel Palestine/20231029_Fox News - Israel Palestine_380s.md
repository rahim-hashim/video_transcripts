# GOP rep says the 'only road' to peace is the 'utter destruction' of Hamas
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4)
*  Let's bring in Republican Congressman Carlos Jimenez of Florida, a member of the House [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=0.0s)]
*  Homeland Security Committee and Armed Services Committee. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=5.16s)]
*  Congressman, thank you for joining us. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=8.6s)]
*  I'm going to get to the hostages, very important subject in a moment, but I want to start here, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=10.76s)]
*  because the IDF says that it responded to three rocket launches from Lebanon and struck [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=14.84s)]
*  Hezbollah terrorist targets. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  This all happening last night, fire exchange still taking place. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  Are you concerned that this war will expand? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=27.14s)]
*  I think everybody should be concerned that this war expands and get a look toward Iran [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=31.98s)]
*  as probably the perpetrator, probably the puppet masters of everything that's happening [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=37.74s)]
*  in the region. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=41.38s)]
*  So, yeah, it would concern me because then it would, you know, fighting a two-front war [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=42.38s)]
*  is a little bit different than putting all your energy into what's going on in Gaza. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=47.900000000000006s)]
*  I know that the Israeli forces are up there and are prepared for anything that may be [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=51.02s)]
*  coming from the north. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=55.9s)]
*  But, you know, the more it's a one-front war, the better it is for Israel and better is [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=57.339999999999996s)]
*  for us, too. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=63.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=65.58s)]
*  And, of course, Congressman, you know, meanwhile, the U.S. has positioned a formidable fleet [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=66.58s)]
*  of assets in the region. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=70.94s)]
*  Jen Griffin, just reporting this hour, the U.S. says Eisenhower has arrived in the Mediterranean [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=72.34s)]
*  Sea. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=78.82s)]
*  So is it possible? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=79.82s)]
*  Of course, we don't want this, but is it possible that the U.S. could get dragged into military [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=81.30000000000001s)]
*  action? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=85.98s)]
*  Everything's possible, but I hope not. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=86.98s)]
*  I think that the Biden administration so far has actually had constraint, restraint in [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=89.82000000000001s)]
*  some of some of their actions. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=97.66s)]
*  I know that they've been, our forces have been fired upon from Syria and from forces [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=100.38000000000001s)]
*  there and that we have struck back. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=107.9s)]
*  And we need to make sure that whatever, if it happens again, it keeps happening, that [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=109.38s)]
*  we do strike back. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=113.5s)]
*  But we don't want to be seen as a part of a problem there. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=115.06s)]
*  If we have too heavy a hand, then it could be an excuse for other people to get involved [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=119.82s)]
*  in this conflict. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=125.94s)]
*  And right now, it's between Hamas and Israel and some Hezbollah. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=127.18s)]
*  If we keep it that way, I think it's a much better outcome. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=131.3s)]
*  I think actually the way it should happen is just try to keep it as contained as possible. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=134.94s)]
*  Although I do believe that Israel has every single right to go into Gaza and destroy Hamas, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=140.02s)]
*  which really should be the final outcome. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=147.58s)]
*  There should be no Hamas after this military action terminates. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=149.94s)]
*  And meanwhile, if this is the second stage of war, it is less aggressive than expected. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=155.10000000000002s)]
*  Would you think that be designed to create room for mediation to release the 230 hostages? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=160.98s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=168.54s)]
*  But also, they've got a tough road to hoe here. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=169.54s)]
*  And of all these tunnels and all, I think they really have to map this out strategically [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=173.34s)]
*  and try to take this down piece by piece and then basically move them out, move them out, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=180.66s)]
*  move them out until they no longer exist. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=187.18s)]
*  Look, the hostages are that's another question. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=189.98000000000002s)]
*  This is what Hamas wanted to do, take a bunch of hostages so that they could slow down [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=194.14000000000001s)]
*  Israel's advance against them and use them as human shields like they use their own people [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=199.26000000000002s)]
*  as human shields. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=204.70000000000002s)]
*  I think Israel understands this and Israel is just going to do what it needs to do at [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=206.06s)]
*  the pace that it needs to do it so that and they see it as the way to be successful. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=210.78s)]
*  They have to be successful. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=217.9s)]
*  They have to win this and they have to destroy Hamas. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=219.18s)]
*  If not, we're going to see this again in the future. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=222.06s)]
*  The only road to lasting peace is with the destruction, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=225.57999999999998s)]
*  utter destruction and elimination of Hamas. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=228.85999999999999s)]
*  And let me billboard what you said, which is that Hamas, let's not forget, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=233.1s)]
*  Hamas is holding people as human shields, even Palestinians, let alone the Americans [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=236.94s)]
*  and foreign nationals. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=242.54s)]
*  So with that billboarded, as I said, and Israel, of course, has the right to defend itself [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=243.74s)]
*  and the barbaric attacks by Hamas are unforgettable. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=249.10000000000002s)]
*  But I do ask, and this is the question I think some people do want to know, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=253.10000000000002s)]
*  not sure there is an answer for it, but how does IDF annihilate the terrorists [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=256.94s)]
*  without killing more innocent Palestinians? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=263.34000000000003s)]
*  Look, I'm not sure it can. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=267.90000000000003s)]
*  And that's unfortunate. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=270.54s)]
*  But if you don't eliminate Hamas now, it'll just cause more lives in the future. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=271.5s)]
*  And so, yeah, it's a difficult choice. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=277.1s)]
*  Israel is doing everything in its power to make sure that it targets Hamas, Hamas fighters, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=278.86s)]
*  and Hamas terrorists, and try not to kill the civilians. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=284.46s)]
*  But Hamas puts its own civilian population at risk. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=289.34s)]
*  Hamas is the one that puts their munitions underneath hospitals and churches [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=293.74s)]
*  and other public buildings. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=299.42s)]
*  And Hamas is the one that's keeping their people there. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=301.26s)]
*  And so, look, at the end of the day, I know there's going to be innocent loss of life. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=304.06s)]
*  I mean, wars is not clean, and there is always innocent loss of life. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=309.18s)]
*  But Israel has to take the action it needs in order to make sure that this doesn't happen again. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=313.98s)]
*  And that not only protects Israeli lives, but it will protect Palestinian lives in the future, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=319.26s)]
*  because every single time that Hamas strikes Israel, there's a retaliation. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=324.46s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=328.38s)]
*  Innocent Israelis die, innocent Palestinians die. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=329.65999999999997s)]
*  And the perpetrator of all this are the actions that are done and perpetrated by Hamas. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=332.94s)]
*  Hamas is the head of the snake in this instance. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=339.9s)]
*  We know the big head of the snake is Iran. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=342.94s)]
*  And Iran has to be taken care of in a separate way. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=345.02s)]
*  But in this instance, it's Hamas. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=348.3s)]
*  That's who we need to take care of. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=350.46s)]
*  That's who Israel needs to take care of to avoid this innocent bloodshed [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=351.65999999999997s)]
*  being spilled in the future. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=357.42s)]
*  We will leave it right there. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=359.42s)]
*  Congressman Carlos Jimenez, thank you very much for joining us. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=363.02s)]
*  And we'll be right back. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7Tj_acxNb4&t=366.86s)]
