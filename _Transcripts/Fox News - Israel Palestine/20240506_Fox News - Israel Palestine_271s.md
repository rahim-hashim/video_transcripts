# Hamas says it agreed to cease-fire deal proposed by Qatar, Egypt
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [May 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4)
*  All right breaking in just the past three minutes Hamas saying it has agreed to a ceasefire [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=0.0s)]
*  framework proposed by Qatar and Egypt [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=4.9s)]
*  it comes as we await a White House briefing with Karine Jean Pierre and John Kirby and as [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=7.32s)]
*  Israeli forces prepare to move into Rafa for a limited scope operation on the heels of its long-promised ground [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=12.52s)]
*  Offensive in Gaza and that's where we begin this Monday afternoon. I'm John Roberts and good Monday to you. Good Monday to you, John [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=18.76s)]
*  I'm Jillian Turner and for Sandra Smith today. This is America reports [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=25.68s)]
*  So the IDF is ordering hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Rafa to begin evacuating now one senior Hamas officials calling the move a quote [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=29.66s)]
*  Dangerous escalation that will have consequences [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=37.54s)]
*  Jeff Paul is live on the ground for us in Tel Aviv with the very latest on all of this Jeff Hamas saying it agrees to a [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=39.82s)]
*  Ceasefire does not necessarily mean it's a done deal [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=46.08s)]
*  No, it certainly does not Hamas released a statement saying that its political leader Ismail Hania had a phone call with both the Qataris and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=51.14s)]
*  The Egyptians who've been involved in this tense mediation process saying they agreed to the deal that's on the table [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=58.58s)]
*  that's been discussed over the last week or so the real question now remains is a [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=65.58s)]
*  What will Israel do? How will they respond and does this include the release of hostages? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=70.62s)]
*  So we'll have to stand by and wait and see at the same time [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=77.1s)]
*  We had a massive development today as the Israeli military started warning [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=79.9s)]
*  Residents and people who live in Eastern Rafa roughly 100,000 Palestinians to start evacuating they dropped [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=85.30000000000001s)]
*  Flyers off in that neighbor in that area in Eastern Rafa as well as making they made phone calls as well as text messages [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=92.42s)]
*  Telling the people who live there that they need to move on to the Mwasi [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=99.74000000000001s)]
*  Humanitarian zone that's an area north of Rafa along the coast of Gaza [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=104.10000000000001s)]
*  The Israeli military says at the moment the order is only temporary and not a large-scale evacuation [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=107.74000000000001s)]
*  However for the civilians who've been told to pack up their things and leave there's not only a sense of frustration [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=114.54s)]
*  But a real concern about their safety [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=119.66000000000001s)]
*  The Israeli occupation told people to go to Rafa and that it is a safe area today [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=123.74000000000001s)]
*  They're telling us to get out of Rafa where will the people go where will all these crowds go? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=128.78s)]
*  1.5 million or 2 million civilians where will they go should they go into the sea? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=134.46s)]
*  Now both of these major developments happening as Hamas just left Egypt yesterday during some tense negotiations [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=139.02s)]
*  But on that very same day there was a deadly attack a mortar attack at the Karim Shalom crossing that the IDF says was fired [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=146.9s)]
*  From that humanitarian zone in Rafa Hamas has claimed responsibility and during a call with US Defense Secretary [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=156.3s)]
*  Lloyd Austin Israel's defense minister you have Galant said they really don't have a choice [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=162.54s)]
*  They've got to get into Rafa [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=166.78s)]
*  And he said at the time that it didn't appear that Hamas was very serious about coming up with some sort of ceasefire [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=168.38s)]
*  Agreement I want you to pay attention to the language here. They use the word ceasefire agreement [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=174.7s)]
*  No mention of hostages [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=179.57999999999998s)]
*  You're gonna want to watch and see how Israel responds because that's gonna be a big part of this like we saw in November [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=181.14s)]
*  Because that's gonna be a big part of this like we saw in November an exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners as well as a pause in the fighting [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=186.74s)]
*  John Gillian [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=194.3s)]
*  Jeff, this is Gillian. How much can a agreement to a ceasefire by Hamas really? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=195.82s)]
*  Mean if we don't know that they have agreed to the core [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=202.7s)]
*  Foundation tended on their side, which is the release of the remaining hostages [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=208.66s)]
*  Yeah, and that's been the tough thing this whole week you you have these little trickles of information some reports saying as many as 30 [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=212.82s)]
*  Hostages could be released some saying 40, you know until you really get that agreement that both parties have agreed to it's hard to tell [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=218.82s)]
*  Exactly what's going to happen [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=226.34s)]
*  But it is interesting that the wording that was used by that statement from Hamas said a ceasefire agreement [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=228.26s)]
*  Surely Israel would likely not agree to that if it didn't include the release of of some of the hostages [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=234.26s)]
*  You've got roughly a hundred and thirty two who they believe are still in there [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=240.29999999999998s)]
*  Okay, Jeff Paul for us in Tel Aviv with the latest Jeff and keep his ear to the ground and see what we hear from the Israeli government [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=244.29999999999998s)]
*  Of course, we've seen in the past that Hamas has said. Oh, yeah, that's a ceasefire [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=250.29999999999998s)]
*  We'd accept when it's been completely disadvantageous to Israel. I'm Steve juicy. I'm Brian kill me [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJpIftvaj4&t=253.57999999999998s)]
