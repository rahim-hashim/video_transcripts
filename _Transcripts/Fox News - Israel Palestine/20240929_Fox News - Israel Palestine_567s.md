# Israel braces for retaliation from Iran after sending 'strong message' with latest attack
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [September 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg)
*  All right, Mike and Eric, for more on this now, let's bring in former Israeli Prime Minister [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=0.0s)]
*  Naftali Bennett. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=5.68s)]
*  Mr. Bennett, thank you very much for joining us here. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=6.68s)]
*  First of all, Iran says this represents a serious escalation and changes the rules of [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=10.0s)]
*  the game. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=16.12s)]
*  So do you anticipate a consequential response from Iran, or did Israel send a strong message [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=17.12s)]
*  to Iran to stop while you can? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=24.04s)]
*  Well, our actions send the message. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=27.68s)]
*  I think what we've seen over the past few hours is that Israel's iron fist can reach [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=30.92s)]
*  anywhere, anywhere in the Middle East. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=36.08s)]
*  And I think the mullahs in Tehran see it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  And I think they're now understanding that if you mess with the Jewish state, we hit [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  back, we hit back powerfully, and we will no longer tolerate anyone who's threatening [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=48.6s)]
*  our people. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=56.0s)]
*  OK, meanwhile, Nasrallah is dead. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=57.6s)]
*  So I ask you, can a decapitated Hezbollah still forge a formidable fight? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=61.56s)]
*  Also, is another idea of ground incursion in Lebanon imminent, or is there a diplomatic [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=66.8s)]
*  off-ramp? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=74.32s)]
*  Well, I want to clarify what our objective is. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=75.47999999999999s)]
*  Our objective is not only a ceasefire, only for Hezbollah to recuperate. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=79.47999999999999s)]
*  Right now, Hezbollah is temporarily paralyzed, almost paralyzed. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=84.72s)]
*  We hit them bad. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=89.55999999999999s)]
*  We killed their CEO, Nasrallah. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=90.55999999999999s)]
*  We killed their board of directors. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=93.35999999999999s)]
*  We killed their executive management. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  And whoever conducted the pager attack also took out much of their mid-level management. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=97.74s)]
*  So right now, Hezbollah is in shambles, but that is temporary. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=104.76s)]
*  If we let off, let up, then they will ultimately be able to recover and threaten our northern [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=109.67999999999999s)]
*  citizens. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=116.56s)]
*  Again, I want to point out, for the past 35 years, they've been making our lives hell. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=117.56s)]
*  They've killed scores of Israelis. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=125.12s)]
*  They killed my best friend. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=127.08s)]
*  Over the past year, they killed dozens of Israelis, including 12 children playing soccer. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=128.88s)]
*  So what we need to set as an objective is to permanently remove the threat of Hezbollah [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=135.76s)]
*  in the north. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=142.35999999999999s)]
*  So does that mean a ground incursion is going to be a part of that maneuver? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=145.48s)]
*  That's a possibility. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=148.6s)]
*  There's a couple of ways to achieve it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=150.6s)]
*  I trust that the IDF knows how to get that done. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  OK, we'll move on. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=158.4s)]
*  We're eight days from the horrific Hamas terror attack in Israel, the day Iran tried to stop [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=160.16s)]
*  normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=166.35999999999999s)]
*  Now, this morning, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham had a message about this. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=169.72s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=173.84s)]
*  To my friends in Israel, to my friends in Saudi Arabia, Bibi gave a great speech about [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=176.2s)]
*  the benefits of the deal. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=181.16s)]
*  I've gone over since last April seven times trying to help this administration normalize [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=182.88s)]
*  between Saudi Arabia and Israel. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=190.0s)]
*  Do not give up. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=192.32s)]
*  Do not let Iran win. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=193.44s)]
*  Do the deal. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=195.48s)]
*  So I ask you, is a deal to end the Arab-Israel conflict going to get done? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=198.56s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=205.76s)]
*  I think that sort of deal where we create an alliance of the positive countries and [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=206.79999999999998s)]
*  the moderate countries in the region, the Saudis, the Emirates, Bahrain, Egypt, et cetera, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=214.2s)]
*  in order to fight and repel the horrible axis of evil of Iran, Hezbollah, Hamas. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=220.56s)]
*  And I think that now with Israel on the offensive, we need to set a very clear goal. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=228.32s)]
*  The goal is that within a reasonable timeframe to topple the Iranian regime of the Islamic [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=234.76s)]
*  Republic of Iran. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=243.04s)]
*  You see, that Iranian regime is the epicenter of all our problems in the Middle East. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=244.72s)]
*  And it's despised by its own people. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=251.32s)]
*  They hate, the Iranian people hate their regime. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=253.44s)]
*  It's an incompetent, corrupt, mean, old regime that will fall. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=256.32s)]
*  But I think America, Israel, and the allies in the region can accelerate the demise of [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=262.76s)]
*  that regime. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=267.4s)]
*  How do you do it and what's a reasonable timeframe? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=269.8s)]
*  Well, you do it not necessarily with war, but you use a bunch of tools similar to what [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=272.2s)]
*  was used against the Soviet Union in the 80s. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=279.68s)]
*  And I'm talking about economic sanctions, diplomatic sanctions. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=282.68s)]
*  I'm talking about empowering the people of Iran who go out in protest. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=286.48s)]
*  And every time they protest, the Iranian regime turns off their internet. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=291.24s)]
*  We can take care of turning it back on. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=295.64s)]
*  There's a lot of things that we can do to empower the Iranian people to overthrow their [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=297.56s)]
*  regime. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=304.04s)]
*  And I want to make one more point. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=305.04s)]
*  Over the past 30 years, and especially the past year after October 7th, our enemies thought [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=307.28000000000003s)]
*  Israel has lost it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=314.64s)]
*  That the Israelis are weak, exhausted, not willing to sacrifice anymore. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=317.16s)]
*  That we've lost our edge. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=322.28000000000003s)]
*  And I'm here to say very clearly, Israel is a nation of lions. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=323.86s)]
*  Our people, thousands of people, drove down on October 7th to defend brothers and sisters [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=330.36s)]
*  and many of them lost their lives. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=335.6s)]
*  The state of Israel has shown that we are willing to sacrifice. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=338.36s)]
*  We are willing to fight for freedom. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=342.20000000000005s)]
*  We are willing to put our ideals on top of our material considerations. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=344.56s)]
*  And we've not lost our edge. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=350.0s)]
*  We can be clever, sophisticated, surprise our enemies, and it's only begun. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=351.68s)]
*  So my point to the region and to our enemies, we're back. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=357.0s)]
*  We're back big. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=362.12s)]
*  And we can make the Middle East a much better place. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=363.3s)]
*  The lions are roaring, no doubt, sir. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=368.56s)]
*  Meanwhile, there is no ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza War. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=371.96s)]
*  Do you know how many hostages are still being held in Gaza that are still alive? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=377.52s)]
*  And is there still a plan to rescue them? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=382.76s)]
*  There's a hundred hostages in Hamas's custody. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=386.28000000000003s)]
*  We don't know the precise number. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=391.36s)]
*  I hope more than half of them are alive. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=393.08s)]
*  We have to bring them home. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=396.7s)]
*  This is a fundamental tenet of Israel's ethos that we never forget anyone. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=399.0s)]
*  We never leave anyone behind. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=406.68s)]
*  Israel must bring them home. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=409.2s)]
*  We have to step up the pressure on Yichy Sanwar and reach a deal where we can bring them [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=410.84s)]
*  home safe and alive, because right now they're suffocating in those tunnels. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=417.88s)]
*  It's a horrible thing. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=423.92s)]
*  And just a few days from now, it's going to be a year for their kidnap. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=425.48s)]
*  They were kidnapped from their beds, from their homes. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=430.56s)]
*  This is unacceptable. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=434.92s)]
*  Indeed, it's unacceptable. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=436.48s)]
*  Do you think you'll get those hostages home soon, sir? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=439.04s)]
*  We have to. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=442.74s)]
*  We have to apply the pressure and at the same time build the right deal to bring them home. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=444.08s)]
*  OK, so Israel is fighting Hamas in Gaza. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=451.76s)]
*  I'm going to wrap here. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=455.16s)]
*  Hezbollah in Lebanon with 37 days until the U.S. presidential election. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=457.04s)]
*  Can U.S. diplomacy work before then? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=462.28s)]
*  Well, we need America's back to defeat our enemies, to remove the noose that's been around [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=466.28s)]
*  our neck for so many years that we mistakenly let it build over the past 15, 20 years. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=474.28s)]
*  But now we are on the offensive. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=481.52s)]
*  What we need from America, America's help is, one, have our back, and two, bring the [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=484.2s)]
*  hostages home, create a deal where we can bring all the hostages home in the right manner. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=489.76s)]
*  I believe America has made it clear that they have your back. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=497.48s)]
*  But I do want to ask you, are we looking at a widespread war now, given what's happening [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=500.24s)]
*  there in Lebanon? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=505.46s)]
*  Well, it is already a widespread war in the sense that our enemies for the past year have [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=508.20000000000005s)]
*  been hitting us again and again and killing Israelis and created a no-man's land in northern [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=513.4s)]
*  Israel. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBiRgWw-NZg&t=520.04s)]
