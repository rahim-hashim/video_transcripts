# Israel confirms Hamas released 14 more Israeli hostages Sunday
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA)
*  This is a Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=0.0s)]
*  The Israeli defense forces have just confirmed that Hamas has released 14 more Israeli hostages [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=3.5s)]
*  today, the third day of the Mideast ceasefire, and no word on the American hostages that [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=9.52s)]
*  the White House had believed could be included today. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=14.72s)]
*  Since Bibi Netanyahu's war cabinet accepted the deal under enormous pressure, Hamas has [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=17.88s)]
*  now released 40 Israeli hostages in exchange for the ceasefire and the release of 150 Palestinian [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=22.44s)]
*  prisoners. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=29.12s)]
*  And of course, we're very happy for those released and their anguished families. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=30.12s)]
*  Netanyahu stressed the war will continue. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=33.84s)]
*  And I'm sure that the day after Hamas, there will be no threat to Israel. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=38.28s)]
*  I don't trust Hamas to do anything right. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=43.6s)]
*  I only trust Hamas to respond to pressure. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  Let's stop right there. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  The media should not fall into the Hamas propaganda trap, but this is some grand humanitarian [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  gesture blessed by God. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=56.64s)]
*  They kidnapped the Israelis as a bargaining chip. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=58.08s)]
*  The Hamas terrorists seizing 240 hostages, most of them civilian families, including [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=60.839999999999996s)]
*  very elderly people and very young infants. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=66.0s)]
*  Think about how barbaric that is. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=68.4s)]
*  Look at that, a two-year-old, an 85-year-old among those released Friday. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=70.84s)]
*  Here's Ohad Mander, nine years old, being released, being reunited with his father. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=75.0s)]
*  And Hamas, which held up yesterday's hostage release for hours, will use the ceasefire [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=83.02s)]
*  to reset its military and put its fighters in a better position to kill more Israelis. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=87.62s)]
*  Netanyahu also came under pressure from President Biden, says he'll, after the poise, he'll [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=92.7s)]
*  resume the military campaign to topple Hamas, which, don't forget, started this war with [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=97.58s)]
*  its brutal massacre on October 7th. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=103.82s)]
*  I'm Howard Kurtz, and this is Media Buzz. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=106.5s)]
*  The hostage deal is drawing sharply different reactions from commentators across the spectrum. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=118.58s)]
*  The problem is, you wonder where the Hamas fighters are going to go every time you pause. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=125.17999999999999s)]
*  Hey, five days, give you 40. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=130.22s)]
*  Well, give me another five days, I'll give you 20. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=132.5s)]
*  A chance to refuel. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=134.66s)]
*  And then give me another, yeah, give me another 20 days, I'll give you another 10. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=135.42s)]
*  So this is the ultimate leverage. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=138.57999999999998s)]
*  It's hard to imagine that the devastation of Gaza is what's moving Bibi Netanyahu to make a deal. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=141.26s)]
*  It's the political pressure that he's under. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=146.54s)]
*  Problem, however, is there are four times that number still held hostage, including Americans. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=148.38s)]
*  I would say bluntly Hamas wins in this particular case. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=154.14s)]
*  They get the resupply, they get the reposition, they get to improve their positions, they get [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=158.06s)]
*  to improve their sniper positions, the use of their ambushes. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=162.7s)]
*  There is no equivalency in kidnapping a two-year-old and a four-year-old [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=167.74s)]
*  and in murdering more than 1300 people. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=173.73999999999998s)]
*  And what's going on today in this hostage release? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=179.17999999999998s)]
*  It's just beyond fathomable. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=185.42s)]
*  We'll go to Israel shortly for a live report, but joining us now to analyze the coverage [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=190.45999999999998s)]
*  in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Ravi Swave, senior editor at Reason Magazine. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=194.22s)]
*  And in San Diego, Laura Fink, a political analyst and CEO of Rebel Communications. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=198.62s)]
*  Ravi, good news that this finally happened. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=203.89999999999998s)]
*  It seemed like it was delayed a couple hours, not as long as the hostage release was delayed [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=205.82s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=210.7s)]
*  But is the media's natural tendency to portray hostage releases as joyous? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=211.1s)]
*  You have lives saved, your family's reunited, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=216.54s)]
*  overshadowing what a savage act it is for Hamas to kidnap civilians. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=219.34s)]
*  You're exactly right. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=227.01999999999998s)]
*  And of course, it's very tempting to be celebratory about this because families are being [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=228.38s)]
*  reunited with people they feared were dead or languishing under horrific conditions. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=234.46s)]
*  So I think it's okay to have some recognition of this as good news for those people and for [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=241.26s)]
*  their families, but we still must be clear-eyed about what Hamas has done, about where the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=247.9s)]
*  blame lies, and about the fact that any pause in fighting can benefit that terrorist organization, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=252.78s)]
*  that it cannot be trusted, that it violated an existing ceasefire. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=259.5s)]
*  That's what kicked off this whole war was Hamas's actions on October 7th. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=262.78s)]
*  So as long as the media must continue to explain... [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=268.7s)]
*  These aren't two equal partners at some deal here. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=272.94s)]
*  This is a terrorist organization that kidnapped people at a music festival that shot them in [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=275.98s)]
*  their homes and in their cars and at bus stations, and we can make no excuse for that. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=280.14s)]
*  I could not agree more. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=285.09999999999997s)]
*  One of the Israelis released today also has Russian citizenship. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=286.46s)]
*  So Laura, Hamas holding up yesterday's release for hours, claiming Israel didn't send enough [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=290.78s)]
*  humanitarian aid to Gaza before backing off, kind of manipulating the coverage as well as [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=296.78s)]
*  the family's emotions. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=302.53999999999996s)]
*  Well, Hamas from day one, from even pre-day one, has sought to manipulate emotions. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=303.66s)]
*  We saw that with the fighters pretending that they were exclusively capturing and killing [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=310.14000000000004s)]
*  militants and soldiers on the Israeli side and cradling children after killing them just [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=317.98s)]
*  minutes before. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=324.14000000000004s)]
*  So this is a propaganda war for Hamas. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=325.18s)]
*  It's certainly accurate, and I think that obviously we should certainly cover it in a way [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=327.42s)]
*  that does not forget or that neglects the atrocities that led to the situation that [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=333.34s)]
*  we are now in. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=338.7s)]
*  I think also, though, that the coverage of the issues of the Palestinian people and the [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=340.06s)]
*  casualties involved in the Israeli attacks in their efforts to eradicate Hamas also has [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=347.09999999999997s)]
*  to be covered, and I think we see some of that as well. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=353.74s)]
*  And I want to make sure that we highlight that that is not propaganda, but that is simply [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=356.38s)]
*  a coverage of the impact of war. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=361.34000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=363.42s)]
*  Yesterday it looked like the deal might collapse during that long delay. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=363.98s)]
*  President Biden spoke directly to the Emir of Qatar, which is acting as the intermediary [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=367.98s)]
*  in these negotiations, and then it was back on. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=372.38s)]
*  Robbie, there were protests in Israel led by some of the hostage families to pressure [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=374.86s)]
*  Bibi to take the deal and free the initial 50, which would be true if we get the further [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=380.7s)]
*  release on the fourth day tomorrow, hostages, women and children, even though that would [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=387.5s)]
*  leave many in Hamas's hands. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=393.18s)]
*  That's the frustration here. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=395.26s)]
*  Yeah, look, it's very difficult, and you can't really begrudge anyone whose own family [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=398.38s)]
*  members or loved ones are being held for wanting to do anything possible to get them home. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=402.86s)]
*  That's something American families have faced when American service members or people in [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=407.98s)]
*  the Middle East have been held by terrorist groups. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=413.82s)]
*  They want to do anything possible to bring them home, and the U.S. government has to [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=415.9s)]
*  act within reason, can't sacrifice our entire national security for that purpose. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=420.06s)]
*  So I understand them, and it's a terrible situation that involves a lot of clear-eyed [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=424.78s)]
*  policymaking, including from our own administration, Biden messaging to Netanyahu and continuing [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=430.06s)]
*  to say what we think is reasonable, given frankly how much support we've given to Israel. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=436.21999999999997s)]
*  I think it's justified for us to do that, but let's not do what the Irish leader said, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=441.02s)]
*  saying that, oh, the children released, they were lost, and then they're found as if they [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=447.02s)]
*  got lost on the woods to grandmother's house or something. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=451.58s)]
*  People of that leftist bent on social media just denying any malice on Hamas's part is [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=454.29999999999995s)]
*  really sickening. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=461.74s)]
*  Yeah, some people earlier claimed there were no hostages. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=462.53999999999996s)]
*  It was all fake, but now we see human beings be released. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=465.02s)]
*  New York Times has Bibi's war cabinet debated for weeks whether to take the deal. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=468.3s)]
*  Some were opposed, didn't want to go along with a ceasefire, because obviously they were [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=473.5s)]
*  worried that such a stoppage of the bombing and other attacks would give the Hamas military [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=479.26s)]
*  a chance to regroup. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=485.34000000000003s)]
*  And that's the balance that they see. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=487.74s)]
*  And I think one of the challenges in reporting on all of this is that you have the fog of war, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=489.98s)]
*  and then you also have the fog of negotiations. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=494.14s)]
*  We don't have the information that these leaders have as they're engaging with militants in [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=496.78s)]
*  tunnels and through the Qatari government. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=503.58s)]
*  So this is a really complex negotiation, and it's difficult for the public to digest it, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=506.14s)]
*  because we don't have it all. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=511.58s)]
*  Now, certainly, Benjamin Netanyahu's government has been rightly criticized for their lapse [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=512.9399999999999s)]
*  in judgment and their lapse in security that would have led to anticipating this attack. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=518.38s)]
*  He also has members of that cabinet that will be making these hostage negotiation decisions are [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=524.22s)]
*  from the far right. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=529.9s)]
*  So they have in the past and continue to be a heavy, lean heavy into the hawkishness [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=530.94s)]
*  rather than negotiation. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=537.4200000000001s)]
*  And I think that's where the international pressure from the U.S. and others came in [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=538.7s)]
*  to be reasonable and to try to do what is best for the hostages, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=542.3000000000001s)]
*  the Israeli people and the Palestinians. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=547.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=549.1800000000001s)]
*  You know, Robbie, you kind of touched on this earlier, but to expand a little bit, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=550.0799999999999s)]
*  the Biden White House let the press know that Joe Biden had been privately pressuring Bibi Netanyahu [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=553.1999999999999s)]
*  and sometimes publicly as well, that he wanted a temporary truce given the soaring death toll [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=561.4399999999999s)]
*  in Gaza, because I think that contributed fairly or unfairly to world opinion turning against Israel. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=567.76s)]
*  Right. And frankly, I mean, we have to think about, you know, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=576.3199999999999s)]
*  the images coming out of Gaza. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=578.56s)]
*  It is horrific. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=580.16s)]
*  And we want, you know, Israel ultimately wants to be a safe and secure place. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=581.28s)]
*  We want America to be safe and secure. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=585.28s)]
*  And, you know, I worry about years from now, just beyond the humanitarian toll, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=587.3599999999999s)]
*  people who, Palestinians who've lost friends and family members, you know, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=592.0799999999999s)]
*  do they turn to terrorism years after this, you know, to continue their war against Israel [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=595.76s)]
*  because of the injustices they've suffered. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=601.04s)]
*  Now, Hamas is absolutely responsible. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=602.8s)]
*  They launched this. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=604.9599999999999s)]
*  They attacked, killed, tortured innocent people. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=606.4s)]
*  But of course, the bulk of the Palestinians are also to some degree hostages of Hamas, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=609.04s)]
*  which is an autocratic government that hasn't held elections since before most of them were born today. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=613.76s)]
*  So, you know, as Israel, you know, pursues justice and tries to get its people back [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=618.96s)]
*  and tries to eliminate this terrorist organization, it does need to think, you know, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=623.28s)]
*  in the long term, we can't, we don't want to make the problem worse. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=626.96s)]
*  We want to solve the problem. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=630.64s)]
*  And that's going to take some level of negotiations, but it's difficult because Hamas [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=631.68s)]
*  is a bad faith actor and that's something everyone in the media needs to recognize, especially. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=635.92s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=640.3199999999999s)]
*  And Hamas, I would go further than an autocratic government. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=641.12s)]
*  I would say it's a dictatorship, obviously, and many Palestinians may support it. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=644.4799999999999s)]
*  Many Palestinians may not, but they don't have any power to do anything. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=648.8s)]
*  So, Laura, this is something of a political win for President Biden, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=651.8399999999999s)]
*  reinforced by the latest release today. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=656.56s)]
*  And yet the coverage reflects how unpopular his handling of the war is, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=660.1600000000001s)]
*  especially among younger people who dislike Israel and favor Hamas, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=666.08s)]
*  which means favoring the destruction of Israel because that's in Hamas's own charter. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=672.24s)]
*  It's not speculation by anybody other than the people who use the chant, you know, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=676.8800000000001s)]
*  from the river to the sea. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=682.4000000000001s)]
*  Well, you know, I haven't heard young people siding with Hamas. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=684.72s)]
*  I think what young people and others who are anti-war feel is that there is a humanitarian [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=688.48s)]
*  and human cost in war, and they have a distinct aversion to that, having grown up with wars [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=694.5600000000001s)]
*  that they perceive to be unsuccessful. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=700.64s)]
*  And so when you look at, and I think that the data bears that out in terms of the Palestinian toll, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=703.04s)]
*  the toll on children and women, which in less than two months has exceeded the number of women [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=708.88s)]
*  and children killed in two years in Ukraine. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=714.88s)]
*  The facts on the ground with the density of the Gazan population and the Palestinians there, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=717.84s)]
*  this truly has been devastating. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=723.44s)]
*  I think you see that reflected in their anti-war stance, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=725.12s)]
*  and I think the media has a responsibility to cover that, as well as to cover the devastation [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=728.32s)]
*  that we see with the families, with the hostages and the threat to Israel's security. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=733.52s)]
*  That balance is incredibly hard to strike and certainly will impact public opinion here in [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=738.24s)]
*  the Arab world now and in the future. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=743.6800000000001s)]
*  Well, I'm going to disagree with that because I think there are plenty of young people who show [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=745.84s)]
*  up at pro-Palestinian or pro-Hamas demonstrations and are siding with the terrorists because that's [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=750.0s)]
*  what's going on here. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=756.64s)]
*  Let me just, you know, there was so much bad publicity about Israel's attack on the Al-Shifa [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=757.6s)]
*  hospital. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=762.64s)]
*  Let me put up the security camera footage that was found on October 7th, the day the war began, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=763.52s)]
*  of Hamas rushing two hostages into that hospital. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=769.36s)]
*  So the idea that the hospital was not used for anything other than medical treatment of sick and [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=772.96s)]
*  wounded pagans, I think was completely disproven by this, as well as some of the discovery of [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=780.4000000000001s)]
*  underground tunnels. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=785.6800000000001s)]
*  Up next, a live report from Israel on the agonizing hostage situation. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842IrhrcpYA&t=786.64s)]
