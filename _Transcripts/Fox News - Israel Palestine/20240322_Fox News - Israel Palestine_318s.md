# Netanyahu cannot be 'hamstrung' by the Biden admin: Trump official
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [March 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8)
*  Secretary of State Ansoni Blinken arriving in Israel this morning to sit [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=0.0s)]
*  down with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Israeli War Cabinet. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=3.7800000000000002s)]
*  It comes as the US is set to call for a UN Security Council vote on a ceasefire [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=7.92s)]
*  and hostage deal today. Joining us now is the former Trump National Security Aid [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=12.52s)]
*  John Elliott. John, good morning to you. So Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  Netanyahu has approved a plan to go into Rafa. The White House says they don't [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=20.72s)]
*  support it so they want to speak to this Israeli delegation before they [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=24.8s)]
*  make any moves. So what happens next? Well Carly, what happens next is that you [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=28.3s)]
*  have a Biden who's putting pressure on Netanyahu and telling him micromanaging [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=35.02s)]
*  how he's conducting the war. And so look, he has a specific task which is to [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=39.82s)]
*  destroy Hamas and they cannot live with any other outcome. And so here we are [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=44.58s)]
*  picking at how he's conducting it saying, well you can go into Rafa here but you [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=49.260000000000005s)]
*  really have to have some humanitarian aid first and this and that. So look, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=53.3s)]
*  the whole thing here is just let Netanyahu run the war. That's the quickest way for [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=57.98s)]
*  this to get done and that's ultimately the best way to relieve the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=62.22s)]
*  humanitarian problem there is to let the Israelis do their job on the ground and [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=66.22s)]
*  then at that point just deal with the aid when we can later on. But he [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=71.17999999999999s)]
*  can't be hamstrung by this Biden administration. Well when it comes to the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=75.25999999999999s)]
*  war and the job that Israel is trying to do, there was a major development earlier [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=78.64s)]
*  this month. Israel killed its highest ranking, the highest ranking Hamas [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=81.82s)]
*  official since the war began. His name is Marwan Issa. He's Hamas's number three [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=86.18s)]
*  in command. So that leaves two people above him, Yaya Sinwar and Mahmoud [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=90.9s)]
*  Mohammed Deif. So hypothetically speaking, if Israel is able to take out [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=95.74000000000001s)]
*  those two people in a targeted fashion, what would that mean? Could that be a [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=100.72s)]
*  big enough deal for that to end the war without Israel having to launch a full [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=106.82000000000001s)]
*  scale invasion into Ra'afah? Well it's hard to tell because this is like a snake [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=111.86s)]
*  when you cut off one head then another snake appears later on. So this is a [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=117.02s)]
*  problem, of course that would be really important for them to target these two [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=121.26s)]
*  top officials that are remaining. But if still if you take them out there still [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=125.22s)]
*  could be on the ground, you could have sub commanders, lieutenants, captains if [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=130.02s)]
*  you will in the company sense, in a military company sense. But bottom line [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=133.86s)]
*  is that we can look to take out the top but that's not necessarily going to cure [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=138.9s)]
*  the problem because what happens here is that you have all these tunnels, you've [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=145.06s)]
*  got all these forces that may not have been waiting for direction from their top [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=148.94s)]
*  two officers. So take them out but then they've got to finish the job and [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=153.46s)]
*  they've got to go into the tunnels and take out the actual fighters at the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=157.18s)]
*  ground level or this thing is never going to be ended. So John, there's this [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=160.7s)]
*  report from a government watchdog group that found that aid money going to [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=165.18s)]
*  Afghanistan through the UN, most of that of course is US taxpayer dollars. Some of [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=169.14000000000001s)]
*  it is going to humanitarian causes but a lot of it is making its way into the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=174.22s)]
*  Afghanistan Central Bank which is run by the Taliban. So that means that US [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=178.70000000000002s)]
*  taxpayer dollars, our hard-earned money, is now being used to support a terrorist [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=183.42000000000002s)]
*  organization. The State Department released a statement said that this is [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=189.06s)]
*  unacceptable but there nowhere in that statement was there any announcement of [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=192.46s)]
*  a plan on how to stop this? Absolutely Carly, if you take a step back, Biden, this [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=196.94s)]
*  is something that we had with his weakness and coming out of [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=202.38s)]
*  Afghanistan. This is something he never held anybody accountable, nobody in the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=206.02s)]
*  DOD, not Lloyd Austin, not Jake Sullivan, so he had no accountability for that [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=210.46s)]
*  botched exit and so this is another example of our weakness here is that we [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=215.46s)]
*  are actually funding the Taliban through their central bank as you point [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=219.62s)]
*  out 2.5 billion dollars and that's out of 2.9 total that the UN is spending. So [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=222.82s)]
*  we're doing about 95% of the funding and because the Taliban controls the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=227.98000000000002s)]
*  central bank it's all going to the Taliban. Absolute disaster. This starts [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=232.5s)]
*  with accountability and it's time for people to wake up at the White House and [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=236.14000000000001s)]
*  hold people accountable for this flowing of money right into this terrorist group. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=239.38s)]
*  So US officials have said that since we withdrew from Afghanistan, ISIS-K has [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=243.42000000000002s)]
*  become the strongest organization, the most dangerous terror group in the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=248.66s)]
*  region and now we're in a position where we have to oversee that threat using the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=252.54s)]
*  over-the-horizon approach. So where does that leave us? Well it leaves us in an [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=257.78s)]
*  incredibly weak position and once again if you go back to this botched exit of [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=263.14s)]
*  Afghanistan there would be what Trump had set up when we were at the National [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=267.3s)]
*  Security Council supporting him is a very good transition over to a divided [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=271.42s)]
*  government where you would actually have the Afghanis not give everything [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=277.1s)]
*  over to the Taliban but that completely collapsed within about four or five [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=281.18s)]
*  months after Biden took office and then he gave away Bagram Air Force Base so [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=284.18s)]
*  now we only have to do to your point that over-the-horizon strike of ISIS [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=288.66s)]
*  instead of having Bagram as a base there where you're gonna have a limited number [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=292.90000000000003s)]
*  of US forces. Now you know who controls Bagram Air Force Base? It's the Chinese. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=296.14000000000004s)]
*  Unbelievable. So many players and all of it concerning. John thank you so much for [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=300.38s)]
*  joining us this morning. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilmeade. And I'm Ainsley [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xISKHDVb8&t=305.86s)]
