# Israeli-American hostage released by Hamas
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1LJx8hnfhM)
*  All right, we are beginning to get more details. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1LJx8hnfhM&t=0.0s)]
*  This is that Rafa Cross that we told you that links Gaza with Egypt and these latest hostages [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1LJx8hnfhM&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  that are being entered and back into Israel. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1LJx8hnfhM&t=8.52s)]
*  Let's get the latest from Nate Foer. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1LJx8hnfhM&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  You could tell us on how that's going, Nate. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1LJx8hnfhM&t=14.56s)]
*  Well, Neal, some very good news to pass along. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1LJx8hnfhM&t=17.52s)]
*  The 10 Israeli hostages are in the hands of the Red Cross, and an American is among those [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1LJx8hnfhM&t=20.92s)]
*  10 hostages, an Israeli American named Liat Benin. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1LJx8hnfhM&t=26.72s)]
*  She's 49 years old, was kidnapped from her kibbutz with her husband, who remains in Hamas [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1LJx8hnfhM&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  captivity. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1LJx8hnfhM&t=36.6s)]
*  We just got a picture of her. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1LJx8hnfhM&t=37.839999999999996s)]
*  We're trying to get that picture processed, and if we can, we'll pull it up. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1LJx8hnfhM&t=39.72s)]
*  But she's just part of this group. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1LJx8hnfhM&t=43.36s)]
*  You mentioned the four Thai hostages as well, but nine Israeli females are included in this [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1LJx8hnfhM&t=45.599999999999994s)]
*  group, including one as young as 13 years old. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1LJx8hnfhM&t=51.32s)]
*  Gali Tarchansky is her name. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1LJx8hnfhM&t=55.44s)]
*  Five teenagers as part of this group that is on their way to Israel right now, after [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1LJx8hnfhM&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  54 days in Hamas captivity, on their way to the Hatzareem Air Base for medical care and [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1LJx8hnfhM&t=64.16s)]
*  to reunite with their families. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1LJx8hnfhM&t=70.08s)]
*  This comes as we're all sort of just waiting to see what will happen tomorrow with the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1LJx8hnfhM&t=72.22s)]
*  Israeli War Cabinet meeting right now to discuss, as I mentioned earlier, that offer by Hamas [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1LJx8hnfhM&t=77.2s)]
*  to extend the previous agreement with additional hostages being released with Palestinian prisoners [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1LJx8hnfhM&t=83.25999999999999s)]
*  going back and the pause in the fighting continuing for another two days. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1LJx8hnfhM&t=90.1s)]
*  So we'll see exactly what Israel says about that. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1LJx8hnfhM&t=95.06s)]
*  But this now means that between seven and eight, those are the estimates from the White [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1LJx8hnfhM&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  House, Americans remain in Gaza now with one less American now being there. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1LJx8hnfhM&t=103.78s)]
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrives in Israel tomorrow as more humanitarian aid [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1LJx8hnfhM&t=109.1s)]
*  continues to funnel into Gaza. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1LJx8hnfhM&t=114.61999999999999s)]
*  And we're all just kind of waiting to see first and foremost that this newest batch [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1LJx8hnfhM&t=117.33999999999999s)]
*  of hostages that they safely arrive in Israel and reunite with their families. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1LJx8hnfhM&t=121.44s)]
*  But also what happens with this pause in the fighting because right now that truce is set [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1LJx8hnfhM&t=125.89999999999999s)]
*  to expire at midnight. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1LJx8hnfhM&t=131.24s)]
*  We'll send it back to you, Neil. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1LJx8hnfhM&t=133.01999999999998s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1LJx8hnfhM&t=134.01999999999998s)]
*  All right, Nate Voight. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1LJx8hnfhM&t=135.01999999999998s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1LJx8hnfhM&t=136.01999999999998s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1LJx8hnfhM&t=137.01999999999998s)]
