# IDF releases footage of Hamas terror tunnels linked to hospitals
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg)
*  the Israeli military trading gunfire with Hamas terrorists in northern Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=0.0s)]
*  The defense minister says Hamas has lost control of the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=10.6s)]
*  Israeli forces now say they have the proof that Hamas is using hospitals, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=15.0s)]
*  even a children's hospital, to hide a vast network of underground tunnels [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=20.1s)]
*  housing a terror command center. They're trying to protect their leadership. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=25.7s)]
*  I'm Harris Faulkner. You are in the Faulkner Focus. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=30.2s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says this war will decide the fate of how far, more than just for Israel. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=33.7s)]
*  We have to win to protect Israel. We have to win to safeguard the Middle East. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=44.6s)]
*  We have to win for the sake of the civilized world. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=51.2s)]
*  That's the battle we're fighting and it's being waged right now. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=54.2s)]
*  There is no substitute for that victory. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=57.2s)]
*  If we don't win now, then Europe is next and you're next and we have to win. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=59.5s)]
*  Israel has released new video from an underground look at a pediatric hospital specializing in cancer treatment. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=65.5s)]
*  So the terrorists have gone underground beneath this very large hospital to protect themselves. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=75.0s)]
*  It apparently shows how the terrorists used it as a base to store grenades, assault rifles, rockets. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=82.9s)]
*  There were also some signs that maybe some of the hostages had been held there. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  I want you to see this room. It's in the basement of the hospital. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=96.60000000000001s)]
*  We can see this area is a closed area from the rest of the hospital. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=102.60000000000001s)]
*  We can see the ventilation air that was done improvisely to this area. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=107.1s)]
*  And we can see infrastructures that was built in here. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=114.1s)]
*  Toilets, shower, a small kitchen will provide the terrorists their needs. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=117.7s)]
*  Also conduct a hideout, a hideout where terrorists take hostages and hideout. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=123.7s)]
*  Despite evidence that Hamas terrorists likely use patients and staff as human shields, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=130.39999999999998s)]
*  as I previously mentioned, President Joe Biden is calling on Israel to show restraint. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=135.39999999999998s)]
*  It is my hope and expectation that there will be less intrusive action relative to the hospital. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=142.39999999999998s)]
*  There is an effort to take this pause to deal with the release of prisoners. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=154.1s)]
*  And that's being negotiated as well with the Qataris engaged. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=159.1s)]
*  And so I remain somewhat hopeful that the hospital must be protected. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=164.1s)]
*  The New York Post editorial board with this blistering headline, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=171.1s)]
*  stop pretending hospital peril is all on Israel, Joe, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=175.1s)]
*  and call out Hamas' central role in endangering civilians. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  And focus now. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=183.79999999999998s)]
*  Let's begin with Pete Hegseth, co-host of Fox and Friends Weekend. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  Pete, great to see you today. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  Just first of all, your reaction to the call by the president for Israel [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=190.79999999999998s)]
*  to better protect the people that Hamas terrorists are using as human shields. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=195.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, that's the same guy in Joe Biden who, I don't know, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=201.79999999999998s)]
*  about seven minutes ago on our channel live was giving a speech [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  or just moments ago saying that climate change is the single greatest threat that we face. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=208.5s)]
*  It's the existential threat to humanity. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=213.5s)]
*  This is the viewpoint of the guy charged with backing up our biggest ally [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=216.5s)]
*  who's at war with an enemy who savagely massacred civilians six weeks ago. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=220.5s)]
*  So what he, I hope Bibi Netanyahu takes the call, hears him out, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=224.5s)]
*  and then does what he needs to do. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=231.5s)]
*  Because ultimately, Hamas is at fault for every single aspect of this [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=233.2s)]
*  to include all the civilians stuck in the hospital underneath the command center. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=237.2s)]
*  So they don't want to kill civilians. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=241.2s)]
*  So if they can get them out to get at the Hamas leadership, they will do that. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=243.2s)]
*  But Israel doesn't need to apologize for having superior technology, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=248.2s)]
*  superior weaponry, and superior fighters in taking back Gaza. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=251.2s)]
*  And they need to eradicate every last one of those Hamas fighters. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=254.2s)]
*  Going through the hospital will be part of what they need to do. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=258.2s)]
*  It's unfathomably complicated, but we don't need our president complicating it even more [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=261.9s)]
*  by trying to dictate basically Hamas talking points to Bibi Netanyahu and Israelis [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=266.9s)]
*  while they're a part of one of the most difficult ground sieges you can conceive of. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=271.9s)]
*  Well, what you pointed out too is that Hamas would love for somebody else [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=276.9s)]
*  to sort of tap Israel on the shoulder and tell them to sit down. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=279.9s)]
*  I mean, that's not just a talking point, that's a goal of those hostage-taking showers. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=284.9s)]
*  That's their strategy. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=289.9s)]
*  That's why they want ceasefires and pauses. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=291.59999999999997s)]
*  They believe condemnation from the international community will be their savior. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=294.59999999999997s)]
*  And if Joe will lead it, then even better off for them. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=298.59999999999997s)]
*  Wow, they have a new king in that, right? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=301.59999999999997s)]
*  Let's talk just a little bit about the hostages if we can. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=303.59999999999997s)]
*  And part of the video that was just shown to us and some of that was narrated by [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=307.59999999999997s)]
*  you saw that Israeli soldier on the ground. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=312.59999999999997s)]
*  Part of that was where we think some hostages had been held. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=315.59999999999997s)]
*  How big are those tunnels? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=321.3s)]
*  And we've heard 300 miles long, but now you've got to talk. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=322.3s)]
*  They can hold supplies for even the hostages we pray. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=325.3s)]
*  Oh yeah, these are not, I mean, we show the stock footage of the tunnels, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=331.3s)]
*  the tunnels that I've been in, which are meant to transport fighters into Israel and around Gaza. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=335.3s)]
*  This is an underground city if what's reported is correct, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=340.3s)]
*  and we have no reason to believe it isn't because Israel has great human intelligence [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=343.3s)]
*  and understanding of a lot of these tunnels. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=349.0s)]
*  It's hundreds and hundreds of miles of command and control facilities underneath that entire city, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=351.0s)]
*  many of which they've already found. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=356.0s)]
*  So this is just the tip of the iceberg, and finding every aspect of those webs is nearly impossible [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=358.0s)]
*  unless you control the ground eventually above, which Israel is trying to do right now. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=365.0s)]
*  I pray for these hostages. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=370.0s)]
*  I pray that the Americans, everyone there, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=372.0s)]
*  that this pressure campaign by Israel puts Hamas in such a tenuous situation [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=375.7s)]
*  that they have to make a massive trade in order to save their hides or buy some time [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=379.7s)]
*  and that those hostages come out. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=386.7s)]
*  Because Israel can't grovel on Hamas's terms. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=388.7s)]
*  They need to bring Hamas to their knees, force them to a moment where these hostages are given up. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=391.7s)]
*  I pray for them. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=395.7s)]
*  I pray that strategy works because that's one of those variables in all of this that are really difficult to calculate. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=396.7s)]
*  100%. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=402.7s)]
*  Pete, I'm going to ask you to stand by and be on the other side of a report that's coming up. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=404.4s)]
*  We'd love to talk with you about this. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=408.4s)]
*  Let's go right now to Alex Hogan, who is on the ground in northern Israel. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=410.4s)]
*  Alex. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=415.4s)]
*  Hi, Harris. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=416.4s)]
*  We have heard sirens really across the country today, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=418.4s)]
*  and at least one person was wounded just in the last several hours in Tel Aviv, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=421.4s)]
*  which is in central Israel. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=425.4s)]
*  But here in the north, we've continued to see airstrikes coming from Lebanon and Hezbollah. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=427.4s)]
*  Here's the scene earlier today. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=433.09999999999997s)]
*  We could see some of the smoke rising on the hillside. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=435.09999999999997s)]
*  That is the border of Israel and Lebanon. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=437.09999999999997s)]
*  Hezbollah launched anti-tank missiles here on northern Israel. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=439.09999999999997s)]
*  Israeli fighter jets quickly responded. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=443.09999999999997s)]
*  And it was last night when the IDF released this footage from a hospital basement [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=445.09999999999997s)]
*  where it appears some hostages were being held. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=450.09999999999997s)]
*  The IDF also released footage of what it says is a cache of weapons that it found there. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=453.09999999999997s)]
*  The US says that it could release 70 hostages through a negotiation for a five-day ceasefire. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=459.8s)]
*  The IDF continuing to press forward, saying that in the last day, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=465.8s)]
*  it took over the parliamentary building in Gaza City, raising the Israeli flag there. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=468.8s)]
*  Now, with major protests taking place around the world demanding a ceasefire, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=473.8s)]
*  those pressures are really being felt here on the ground. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=477.8s)]
*  Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen made a statement that the military here [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=481.8s)]
*  probably only has about two to three weeks before it gives in to the international pressure. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=487.5s)]
*  Well, those comments did not go over well here in Israel. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=491.5s)]
*  He quickly took his statement back. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=494.5s)]
*  But we have heard from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying that [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=496.5s)]
*  once Hamas is defeated, Israel will control the security for an indefinite period of time. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=499.5s)]
*  We talked with an aide to the former prime minister who argues that [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=504.5s)]
*  there's a lot of demands internationally, but there's no suggestions about what should happen. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=509.5s)]
*  Nobody wants to rule Gaza as long as Hamas is still standing on its feet. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=515.2s)]
*  I don't think that we have limitless time in terms of international support. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=520.2s)]
*  I do think that eventually there will be a pressure for a ceasefire. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=525.2s)]
*  Meanwhile, for now, as the IDF continues to press forward in northern Gaza, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=532.2s)]
*  the IDF says that it's taken control of a Hamas control center [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=536.2s)]
*  as well as the police headquarters there. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=540.2s)]
*  Alex, great information there, great reporting as always. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=542.9000000000001s)]
*  Stay safe. Thank you very much. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=545.9000000000001s)]
*  I want to bring back Pete Hegseth. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=547.9000000000001s)]
*  So Pete, you and I were just watching together. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=549.9000000000001s)]
*  I had seen this in Reuters and now Alex Hogan is talking about it as well. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=551.9000000000001s)]
*  Apparently some conversation around, wouldn't want to call it a negotiation at this point, I suppose. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=555.9000000000001s)]
*  But Hamas could release 70 hostages for a five-day ceasefire. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=560.9000000000001s)]
*  Now that's not all of the hostages that we know of, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=564.9000000000001s)]
*  and we don't know how many would be Americans. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=567.9000000000001s)]
*  What do you think about it? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=571.6s)]
*  Well, we know that's kind of been the parameters of what Hamas has been bargaining through Qatar from the beginning, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=574.6s)]
*  is how many people for how much time? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=580.6s)]
*  How many people for how much time? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=582.6s)]
*  In fact, at the beginning it was, oh, we want to release two for a day pause. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=583.6s)]
*  Well, now it's up to 70 for five days. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=587.6s)]
*  That ratio is getting better for the Israelis. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=590.6s)]
*  What does that tell you? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=593.6s)]
*  What that tells me is they aren't in control of Gaza, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=596.3000000000001s)]
*  and they know the Israeli army is surrounding them, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=599.3000000000001s)]
*  and they know, first of all, they have human shields in the hospital, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=602.3000000000001s)]
*  and now they have hostage shields. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=606.3000000000001s)]
*  So they're trying to up the ante of the amount of time that they get with those, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=608.3000000000001s)]
*  but their leverage is going down. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=612.3000000000001s)]
*  So Israel has to press hard enough to where they get all the hostages [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=614.3000000000001s)]
*  or close to all of them for whatever period of time, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=618.3000000000001s)]
*  but doesn't give enough time that Hamas leadership and others are able to flee [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=620.3000000000001s)]
*  with a pause. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=626.0s)]
*  And so now you've defeated your under arching goal, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=627.0s)]
*  which is the destruction of Hamas, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=629.0s)]
*  because they will use this pause for their own military means. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=631.0s)]
*  And that's the impossible calculation here. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=634.0s)]
*  Well, and the impossibility of being able to run away fast enough [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=636.0s)]
*  from the hostage-taking killers in order to really see freedom. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=639.0s)]
*  They might let them go when they shoot them in the back as they run away. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=644.0s)]
*  I mean, there's just so much to calculate in all of this. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=648.0s)]
*  They're basically now, though, losing leverage, as you said, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=650.0s)]
*  and negotiating against themselves. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=653.0s)]
*  They can go back and go two ways. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=655.7s)]
*  They can continue to do that, and Israel makes ground with them [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=657.7s)]
*  and against them and for the hostages, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=660.7s)]
*  or they implode. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=663.7s)]
*  And you cannot underestimate the amount of leverage that Iran has in this equation. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=665.7s)]
*  What is Iran telling Hamas to do? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=672.7s)]
*  Do they want them to be martyrs for the cause? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=674.7s)]
*  Do they want them to ultimately execute these prisoners [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=676.7s)]
*  unless they can't get a certain amount of leverage out of it? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=679.7s)]
*  They want a wider war. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=683.4000000000001s)]
*  And that's why when... [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=685.4000000000001s)]
*  And that may be Iran talking. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=687.4000000000001s)]
*  You fight them... [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=689.4000000000001s)]
*  That might be. You can make too much of what Bibi Netanyahu said, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=691.4000000000001s)]
*  which is if we don't beat them, then you don't beat them. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=694.4000000000001s)]
*  Where that is true is that if Iran gets a nuclear bomb in this context, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=696.4000000000001s)]
*  then this is not just Israel's problem, it's our problem. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=700.4000000000001s)]
*  And so Israel needs to do what it can to bring Iran to its knees in that context. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=702.4000000000001s)]
*  Excuse me. I want everybody to look at their screen. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=707.4000000000001s)]
*  We have rocket fire now on the Israel-Gaza border. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=709.4000000000001s)]
*  There are a number of flashes. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=712.1s)]
*  There was a flare that was sent up. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=714.1s)]
*  And Trey Yings and Mike Tobin have taught us that when those flares go up, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=716.1s)]
*  they're trying to decide or determine who's firing on them. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=720.1s)]
*  So they light up the area where some of the firing is coming from. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=724.1s)]
*  Let's just take a... Let's stop talking for a second. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=728.1s)]
*  Can we listen? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=730.1s)]
*  So this is the hour. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=739.1s)]
*  This is daylight savings time. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=741.8000000000001s)]
*  So it's even a little bit darker now during this hour. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=743.8000000000001s)]
*  But this is the hour each day where darkness does begin to fall. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=745.8000000000001s)]
*  It's already fallen now. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=749.8000000000001s)]
*  They obviously don't observe daylight savings time like the rest of the world. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=751.8000000000001s)]
*  But what this means is that we will continue at this hour, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=755.8000000000001s)]
*  as the war goes on, to see more and more of this. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=757.8000000000001s)]
*  Pete, they are hitting them hard. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=761.8000000000001s)]
*  Absolutely, they are. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=765.8000000000001s)]
*  And you know, at this point, much of Gaza is dark because of the responsibility of Hamas. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=768.5s)]
*  They have created this war, deprived basic necessities of their people, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=776.5s)]
*  brought war onto the Gaza Strip. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=780.5s)]
*  And Israel is waging that war with planes and munitions that can see through that darkness, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=782.5s)]
*  that can hit those targets and identify fighters in that darkness. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=787.5s)]
*  And that darkness is the advantage of the Israelis. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=791.5s)]
*  You've noticed, Harris, there hasn't been as much rocket fire coming out of Gaza, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=795.2s)]
*  thank God, into the Israeli population in the last couple of weeks and days [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=799.2s)]
*  because their capabilities have been severely diminished. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=804.2s)]
*  They are in panic mode. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=807.2s)]
*  And as a result, Israel can control the night in ways that are advantageous militarily for them, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=809.2s)]
*  protecting their infantry troops as best they can, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=816.2s)]
*  who are, again, going through civilian populations and trying to hit military targets as well. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=819.9000000000001s)]
*  Control the night. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=824.9000000000001s)]
*  Those are very specific words that you've chosen. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=826.9000000000001s)]
*  There will never be necessarily an element of surprise in this scenario [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=829.9000000000001s)]
*  because everyone knows that they are surrounded at this point, Hamas, Harris. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=833.9000000000001s)]
*  But the nightfall is really where they hit those targets with more efficiency. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=838.9000000000001s)]
*  That's what I've heard you and others say. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=843.9000000000001s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=846.6s)]
*  Anything moving at night is an enemy combatant. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=848.6s)]
*  Targets you've identified throughout the day as you've surveilled movements of troops and equipment [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=852.6s)]
*  become targets at night. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=857.6s)]
*  And ultimately, you can pre-position ground troops with night vision devices and others that [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=859.6s)]
*  Hamas is going to have some of that supplied by Iran, no doubt. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=865.6s)]
*  But Israel is going to have the overwhelming advantage of the ability to see at night. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=868.6s)]
*  And so a lot happens while our cameras can't see it for the good guys trying to take out Hamas in the Gaza Strip. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=873.3000000000001s)]
*  Our reporter Alex Hogan moments ago got us to start talking about Hamas. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=880.3000000000001s)]
*  And some talks you mentioned, Cutter, might be, from the beginning, you said, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=886.3000000000001s)]
*  has kind of been trying to figure out where Hamas would be releasing hostages for what. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=890.3000000000001s)]
*  Well, now they say maybe release 70 hostages for maybe a five-day ceasefire. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=897.0s)]
*  But when you look at controlling the war, does that make them more desperate? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=903.0s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=907.0s)]
*  That's a fair point, Harris. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=909.0s)]
*  That's a very fair point. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=911.0s)]
*  The other one is Qatar is, you know, they're housing the leadership of Hamas. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=913.0s)]
*  So they're not fair arbiters here. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=917.0s)]
*  You're dealing with double players. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=919.0s)]
*  But that's the thought. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=921.0s)]
*  And that's going to be a discussion inside Israel, is they've been so degraded in Hamas, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=923.7s)]
*  do we take that moment to get those hostages out, take that pause, and then continue our offensive? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=927.7s)]
*  And that's the kind of decision that leadership have to make. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=933.7s)]
*  Pete Hexeth, thank you so much. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=937.7s)]
*  As always, in focus, both bringing us your experience as a former warrior yourself, we appreciate it. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=939.7s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMMxdmv_tGg&t=947.7s)]
