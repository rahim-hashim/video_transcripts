# Kayleigh McEnany: I'm scared for our country
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss)
*  Hello everyone, this is Outnumbered. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Emily Campagno here with my co-host, Kaylee McEnany, and also joining us today, Fox News [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=6.2s)]
*  contributor Tammy Bruce, Restoring America editor for the Washington Examiner and senior [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=11.620000000000001s)]
*  fellow for the Independent Women's Forum, Kaylee McGee White, and Fox & Friends co-host [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=16.92s)]
*  and host of One Nation, Brian Kilmeade. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=22.16s)]
*  We are now entering the final hours of the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=25.84s)]
*  Negotiators are currently working to extend that deal, which has lasted for six days. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=31.68s)]
*  So far, 81 hostages have been released by Hamas, with more expected to be released in [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=37.12s)]
*  the coming hours. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=42.4s)]
*  And new details are emerging about the conditions those hostages are facing in the tunnels beneath [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=44.08s)]
*  the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=49.06s)]
*  The Hamas terrorists reportedly threatened child hostages at gunpoint. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=50.36s)]
*  They held captives with little food, water, and no light. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=54.96s)]
*  And they even forced them to watch the footage of the horrific October 7th attack. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=59.92s)]
*  Despite the heartbreaking accounts from Israeli hostages, pro-Palestinian supporters here [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=67.36s)]
*  in the U.S. spewed out conspiracy theories and expressed support for Hamas' terrorist [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=72.2s)]
*  attacks against Israel at a city council meeting in Oakland, California. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=78.4s)]
*  There have not been beheadings of babies and rapings. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=83.88s)]
*  Israel murdered their own people on October 7th. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=86.36s)]
*  Calling Hamas a terrorist organization is ridiculous, racist, and plays into genocidal [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  propaganda that is flooding our media and that we should be doing everything possible [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=93.32s)]
*  to combat. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=96.6s)]
*  I support the right of Palestinians to resist occupation, including through Hamas, the armed [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=97.6s)]
*  wing of the unified Palestinian resistance. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=102.56s)]
*  As an Arab, asking with this context to condemn Hamas is very anti-Arab racist. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=104.91999999999999s)]
*  The notion that this was a massacre of Jews is a fabricated narrative. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=110.4s)]
*  Many of those killed on October 7th, including children, were killed by the IDF. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=113.98s)]
*  An amendment condemning Hamas is bald propaganda meant to... [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=119.64s)]
*  To hear them complain about Hamas' violence is like listening to a wifebeater complain [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=124.08000000000001s)]
*  when his wife finally stands up and fights back. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  Question. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  Did anyone else notice that those who opposed this resolution are old white supremacists? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=133.48000000000002s)]
*  There's been a lot of atrocity propaganda ranging from claims of beheaded babies to [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=138.6s)]
*  macerate. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=142.2s)]
*  Tammy, it frankly nauseates me to listen to that, but you made such a fundamental point [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=143.2s)]
*  as I was complaining about it, which is that we need to hear this so that we know that [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=151.32s)]
*  it exists. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=156.4s)]
*  Yes, and your disgust is appropriate, but it's important for us to see it because otherwise [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=157.4s)]
*  unbelievable that you've got adult individuals in the United States, but it shows you the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=164.24s)]
*  depth. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=169.64000000000001s)]
*  When we talk about pathologies and mental illness and the degree of what happens when [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  you're indoctrinated, when you're manipulated with lies and that's all you hear, the human [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=175.08s)]
*  mind is fragile. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=182.24s)]
*  And this is why Jew hatred and the attack on general populations around the world for [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  millennia has been possible because of the nature of humanity, of the human condition, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=190.34s)]
*  of the fragility of the human mind. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=196.06s)]
*  What we have now in America and around the world, it can be used for bad like social [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=198.1s)]
*  media or it allows us to see that, have our conversation, remind people of what this means, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=202.45999999999998s)]
*  what this is and who we're trying to argue with. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=209.14s)]
*  You can't make ceasefires with people who think that way. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=212.42s)]
*  You can't win an argument with people who think that way. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=216.16s)]
*  It's something very different. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=219.3s)]
*  So you just must move forward on what is right, what is normal, of value, celebrating human [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=220.3s)]
*  life and decency and that is what has got to prevail because that's the majority of [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=226.62s)]
*  people who believe that. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=231.14000000000001s)]
*  And each of those people, Kaylee, they deserve their own assessment, their own analysis of [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=232.64000000000001s)]
*  the frankly vile commentary that they were spewing forth. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=238.46s)]
*  We don't have time unfortunately to do it, but when you take it in the aggregate, I mean, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=241.36s)]
*  complaining about Hamas, you mean reporting about child beheadings, you mean expressing [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=246.02s)]
*  condemnation against terrorist organizations, fabricating, again, reporting old white men. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=250.78s)]
*  No, the world is shocked. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=257.3s)]
*  The world condemns this behavior and expresses solidarity with an entire people that others [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=258.94s)]
*  have expressed as their complete goal to eradicate. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=264.94s)]
*  And yet there they stand with their self-righteousness lecturing us. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=268.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=272.18s)]
*  We have a morality problem in this country and you watched that and that's the only take away. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=272.68s)]
*  Look, your antennas might have gone up when there were people in the country who said [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=277.06s)]
*  I want to put pornography in front of kindergartners. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=280.82s)]
*  Your antennas went up when there were people in this country who said I want to kill a [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=283.66s)]
*  child, a fully formed human child, abortion until birth. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=287.66s)]
*  Your antennas kind of went up. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=290.7s)]
*  But I maintain that what we are seeing with our ally Israel against terrorist Hamas, which [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=292.38s)]
*  to be clear is a battle of good versus evil, has exposed a level of moral depravity in [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=296.98s)]
*  our country and across the globe that I was shocked and quite frankly was unaware even existed. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=303.02000000000004s)]
*  The vote that was taken before this vote was a vote among the Oakland City Council simply [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=308.78000000000003s)]
*  to condemn the evils of Hamas. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=314.02000000000004s)]
*  It failed six to two. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=317.1s)]
*  You pair that with people tearing down posters of children who exhibit our common humanity. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=319.94s)]
*  You pair that with people chasing teachers and Jewish students into rooms. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=325.42s)]
*  What do you have? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=329.56s)]
*  You have a society that can't say it's wrong to put babies in ovens and kill pregnant women [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=330.7s)]
*  while their babies are beside them still in the umbilical cord. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=334.90000000000003s)]
*  I'm scared for our country. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=337.42s)]
*  I'm scared for our world. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=338.74s)]
*  In the UN, where are you United Nations? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=339.74s)]
*  You can't even condemn it. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=341.82s)]
*  Shame on you. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=342.82s)]
*  That's right. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=343.82s)]
*  And Kulmead, you know, it's almost laughable. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=344.82s)]
*  We're not so horrific. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=346.46000000000004s)]
*  The kinds of people that are parading in front of the microphone who have the luxury of [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=348.38s)]
*  alive, the seemingly young people who have been indoctrinated clearly in the Bay Area [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=353.02s)]
*  where I'm from, who again have it so good. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=356.97999999999996s)]
*  Life there is so good, except for if you're the people where crime is affecting, lack [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=360.38s)]
*  of housing, inflation, all the like. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=365.58s)]
*  But this, they have the luxury of being able to parade around with their signs and again [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=367.97999999999996s)]
*  their condemnation with their woefully undereducated feelings. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=372.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=376.06s)]
*  I mean, they live in a mess. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=377.06s)]
*  Oakland is a crime-ridden city and they've lost their football team and about to lose [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=378.38s)]
*  their baseball team for a good reason. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=382.9s)]
*  But we should not be surprised by these statements. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=385.46s)]
*  The same people that are protesting at Columbia, the same people that are going to be at Rockefeller [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=387.65999999999997s)]
*  Plaza right across the street today, these people are the next generation. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=391.06s)]
*  And you know, evidently you need good grades to get into Harvard. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=395.14s)]
*  We're still allowed to have good grades, which for now. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=398.05999999999995s)]
*  So Harvard, Yale, Columbia, to get into the school you need grades. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=401.09999999999997s)]
*  So you're not talking about people that are necessarily ignorant. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=404.34s)]
*  You're talking about they feel as though they are right. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=407.1s)]
*  And I think sooner or later, if we don't get a hold of this and find out where this emanates [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=409.98s)]
*  from, you're going to find politicians who want to get votes from those people refusing [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=414.62s)]
*  to back Israel because they don't get elected if they do because these 18-year-olds become [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=418.70000000000005s)]
*  22, 26, 28, 32. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=423.86s)]
*  They become moving up in the executive ranks and they're going to go all of a sudden be [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=426.02000000000004s)]
*  people of power who will change their minds. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=429.02000000000004s)]
*  And that next thing you know, we will not have our ally in Israel. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=431.94s)]
*  And I think it's just absolutely out of control that so far Israel has lost the propaganda [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=434.94s)]
*  war through no fault of their own. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=440.38s)]
*  And just when I think it's only an American problem, I look overseas. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=443.74s)]
*  You know, you talk to Piers Morgan, he says these are not just people that have come here [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=447.1s)]
*  first generation immigrants. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=450.82s)]
*  There are British people rioting, taking over London, who are rioting for Hamas and the [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=452.42s)]
*  Palestinians. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=457.46s)]
*  So this is not just an American issue, but there is a right and wrong and hopefully people [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=458.54s)]
*  will see their way through it. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=462.1s)]
*  And you know, to Kilme's point about that Israel's losing the propaganda war, that is [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=463.5s)]
*  a specific goal articulated by Hamas and Iran to have global condemnation of Israel. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=468.94s)]
*  In part, and this went back to the violence and sheer atrocities of their attack, was [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=475.1s)]
*  to provoke such a response by Israel as that the globe would condemn it. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=479.70000000000005s)]
*  We've seen that time and time again. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=484.3s)]
*  But at the end of the day, as Kayleigh said, it is good versus evil. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=486.3s)]
*  There is no sides here, and yet there seems to be sides for all those people in Oakland. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=489.14s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=493.5s)]
*  And we know the outcome of this meeting was a unanimous resolution basically calling for [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=494.5s)]
*  a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=498.94s)]
*  And that's horrifying in and of itself. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=501.18s)]
*  But I do think there's an element to this where I honestly find it a little bit funny. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=502.65999999999997s)]
*  Like, thank you so much, Oakland City Council. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=506.09999999999997s)]
*  I'm sure that everyone in the Middle East was waiting with bated breath for you to weigh [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=508.21999999999997s)]
*  in on this conflict. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=511.21999999999997s)]
*  But the point is they don't think that they're actually going to accomplish anything. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=512.8199999999999s)]
*  They know they're not contributing anything to the conflict. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=515.9399999999999s)]
*  What this is is there's a common denominator and everyone that you saw get in front of [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=518.74s)]
*  that microphone. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=522.74s)]
*  You saw it during COVID. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=523.94s)]
*  You saw it during Black Lives Matter. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=525.0600000000001s)]
*  You saw it with many of these other social justice causes, which is what you touched [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=526.94s)]
*  on. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=531.1s)]
*  These people have no moral foundation, so they've had to make one for themselves. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=532.1s)]
*  This makes them feel good about themselves. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=535.94s)]
*  They get to pat themselves on the back and say, oh, look, I'm on board with the latest [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=538.1400000000001s)]
*  social justice cause. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=542.0600000000001s)]
*  I feel so much better about myself. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=543.38s)]
*  I'm going to stand up here with a mask on and preach to you all about how you're killing [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=545.1s)]
*  children in Gaza. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=548.74s)]
*  That is the goal here. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=550.46s)]
*  This resolution contributes nothing besides a little ego boost for everyone on the city [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=551.5s)]
*  council to feel good about themselves. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=556.14s)]
*  They should feel ashamed because they're obviously on the wrong side of the story. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=558.58s)]
*  But that's what this is about. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=562.1800000000001s)]
*  Right next to Oakland in the same urban sprawl as Berkeley, California, which has a significant [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=564.74s)]
*  Jewish population. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=569.26s)]
*  I wonder, to your point, this does little to actually further anything, but what it [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=570.38s)]
*  does is to stoke fear, rightly so, amongst the Jewish population who are living in neighbors [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=574.14s)]
*  to all of those people who now are. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=579.8199999999999s)]
*  And I had one tiny thing. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=581.66s)]
*  What this does in seeing this also eliminates, it kind of alleviates for people the suspension [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=583.3s)]
*  of disbelief, which is what we normally do when we go see a movie, is that we disbelieve [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=588.78s)]
*  this dynamic of what's happening in our government. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=594.5s)]
*  Now this curtain has been pulled back. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=597.74s)]
*  And it's frightening what's behind it. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=600.34s)]
*  Can't unsee it. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX9anH2G6Ss&t=601.34s)]
