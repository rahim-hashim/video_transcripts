# IDF renews evacuation warning to Gaza residents: For your 'personal safety'
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8)
*  We are back with the Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=0.0s)]
*  Israeli forces striking Hamas targets from the air and the ground with a vengeance, pummeling [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=3.74s)]
*  terror targets with missiles and artillery. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=8.06s)]
*  And a new warning tonight from the IDF for Gaza citizens to get out now. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=20.62s)]
*  We are calling the north residents, the Gaza residents and those in the north to temporarily [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=26.5s)]
*  move south. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=33.62s)]
*  It's for their own personal safety today. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=34.620000000000005s)]
*  We are stressing this is an urgent call to you. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  Also tonight, utter chaos as thousands raid United Nations aid warehouses in central and [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=42.620000000000005s)]
*  southern Gaza to take basic goods. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=47.8s)]
*  Lucas Tomlinson is live in Tel Aviv with what's happening on the ground right now. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=50.620000000000005s)]
*  Lucas. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=55.14s)]
*  Well, Charlie, Israeli forces say since the October 7th massacre, they've killed over [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=56.14s)]
*  55 senior Hamas leaders. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=61.92s)]
*  This is Israeli forces continue their push into the Gaza Strip so far about two miles [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=64.88s)]
*  deep. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=70.02s)]
*  They've been inside Gaza now for over 48 hours and there's no sign of them leaving. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=71.02s)]
*  In fact, Israel's prime minister and defense minister say they're both going to be staying [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=75.5s)]
*  there for a while. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=79.7s)]
*  Since 2005, the Israeli flag was raised. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=81.9s)]
*  Now while there's been a lot of focus of what's going on in Gaza with the Palestinians moving [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=85.14s)]
*  from north to south, as you just mentioned, Charlie, today we had the opportunity to speak [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=90.18s)]
*  to some of the displaced Israeli families. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=93.72s)]
*  250,000 Israelis have been displaced since this war started, both in the northern part [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=96.42s)]
*  of the country on the border with Lebanon, of course, down south next to Gaza. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  Charlie. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=106.10000000000001s)]
*  Lucas said this is Jason Chaffetz. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=107.10000000000001s)]
*  Thanks for the great reporting that you're doing. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=110.7s)]
*  Going back to those hostages, I want you to listen to this sound that we have from Michael [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=114.34s)]
*  Herzog, the ambassador for Israel to the United States, and get your reaction to it. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=119.46000000000001s)]
*  We gave a chance to talk through the Qataris and others to see if we can get out hostages. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=126.38s)]
*  Ultimately, it was obvious to everybody involved that Hamas was just playing for time. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=134.1s)]
*  They were not serious about this. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=139.98s)]
*  So we are applying pressure now inside Gaza, but I still hope that our pressure will encourage [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=143.26s)]
*  them to release hostages as we move and press them on and on. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=150.5s)]
*  Hostages are such a prime, they're so key to getting these people back. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=157.89999999999998s)]
*  But why does that number also keep fluctuating? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=164.14s)]
*  It went up again today. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=166.29999999999998s)]
*  Which just shows how large the massacre was. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=170.73999999999998s)]
*  Over 1,400 Israelis killed. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=173.1s)]
*  You have a number of dual citizens also, Jason. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=175.38s)]
*  So about half the hostages are actually dual citizens. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=177.94s)]
*  We know from the White House that up to 10 Americans could be among them. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=181.54s)]
*  In fact, about 50 of the hostages are from Thailand. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=185.66s)]
*  There's some of the farm workers from the kibbutz that were assaulted and taken captive. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=188.78s)]
*  So that's been a big issue with the hostages. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=193.57999999999998s)]
*  They're not all Israeli, or at least they're not all. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=196.14s)]
*  Many are dual citizens. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=199.82s)]
*  So it's very confusing, you know, the French as well. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=200.82s)]
*  But as you saw from that video you just ran, that was Sayyed 13. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=204.94s)]
*  Those are Israeli Navy SEALs. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=207.89999999999998s)]
*  That's not stopping Israeli forces from moving into Gaza. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=209.42s)]
*  In fact, just recently I spoke to a big tech mogul here who recently was a former infantry [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=212.26s)]
*  officer in the Golan√© Brigade. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=218.01999999999998s)]
*  He was pretty hawkish. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=220.22s)]
*  He said Gaza needs to be flattened. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=221.22s)]
*  He says they need to move in. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=223.7s)]
*  No negotiations with the hostages and, excuse me, with Hamas over the hostages. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=225.01999999999998s)]
*  And when you mention Qatar, many people think there's many sides to that face in Qatar. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=230.29999999999998s)]
*  Lucas, Lisa Booth here. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=235.9s)]
*  I interviewed former Army Ranger Sean Parnell, who was really concerned about the delaying [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=238.38s)]
*  of this ground invasion, how long it was taking. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=243.34s)]
*  Talking about how what he's learned through his military career, it could increase Israeli [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=246.22s)]
*  casualties anywhere from 33 to 66 percent, giving Hamas time to lay IEDs and to prepare [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=249.76s)]
*  for this. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=255.6s)]
*  Has Israel expressed any of those concerns? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=256.59999999999997s)]
*  Are any of those concerns playing out? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=260.0s)]
*  What are you hearing? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=262.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, to be fair, Lisa, you know, Hamas has also had, you know, years to prepare for this [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=263.03999999999996s)]
*  operation. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=269.84s)]
*  And so the idea of going in too quickly, I mean, you saw what happened during the massacre [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=270.92s)]
*  when commandos, Israeli soldiers, in some cases, if there was no room on the helicopter, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=276.04s)]
*  jumped in their own personal vehicles and ran down south, they were met with an ambush, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=281.0s)]
*  you know, hail of gunfire, RPGs. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=286.2s)]
*  And they're trained, as you mentioned earlier with Sean, to go in quickly. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=288.32s)]
*  The problem is that's also very dangerous as well. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=292.48s)]
*  So while Hamas has had time to prepare for this, what Israel is doing is a little bit [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=295.56s)]
*  different. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=301.0s)]
*  They're laying siege. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=302.0s)]
*  They're going in slowly. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=303.0s)]
*  They've taken a few miles. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=304.04s)]
*  They raised the Israeli flag for the first time since 2005. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  They're saying we're here. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=308.36s)]
*  We're not going anywhere. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=309.36s)]
*  And they're actually laying siege. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=311.16s)]
*  They're slowly going to starve out Hamas. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=312.96000000000004s)]
*  And they're taking out some of these tunnels, of course, with these hostages, though, in [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=315.66s)]
*  their location. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=318.76s)]
*  It's certainly tricky, certainly dicey. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=319.76s)]
*  I don't think there's clear there's no easy solution to getting the hostages out, especially [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=321.24s)]
*  alive. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=326.36s)]
*  Lucas, Molly, a line here. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=327.36s)]
*  You're kind of laying the groundwork for something that we've been hearing, is that the leadership [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=329.48s)]
*  there in Israel seems like they're prepared to stay there for quite some time. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=333.64s)]
*  As you mentioned, a flag has been planted. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=337.59999999999997s)]
*  Your thoughts on that? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=339.4s)]
*  Well, people are angry here in the country while you're seeing protests outside of Israel, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=343.4s)]
*  inside this country, even some of the most left-wing people here. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=348.64s)]
*  I was speaking to a man on the street earlier who wanted to nuke Iran. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=351.4s)]
*  And he was certainly no right-winger or Benjamin Netanyahu supporter. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=355.44s)]
*  People are angry here. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=359.86s)]
*  They want vengeance. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=360.86s)]
*  They want revenge. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=361.86s)]
*  They're hostages back. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=363.08000000000004s)]
*  You see the ages. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=364.08000000000004s)]
*  You know, they stem from three years old, nine, 12, to 80, 85 years old. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=365.08000000000004s)]
*  They want their people back. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=369.88s)]
*  They want the hostages back. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=371.84000000000003s)]
*  They also want to make sure something like this never happens again. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=373.26s)]
*  So with the strikes, many people just want to see Gaza leveled. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=376.14s)]
*  They want people to push down south and really just to take over the whole northern end of [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=380.18s)]
*  the Gaza Strip, level the place, wipe out Hamas, and try to free the hostages. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=385.54s)]
*  It's a tall order for sure. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=391.42s)]
*  We've also spoken to people on the street who say, you know, how do you destroy an idea? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=392.90000000000003s)]
*  And that's, you know, as we found out in the war on terrorism for 20 years, it's very hard [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=396.74s)]
*  to stamp out terrorism, much like, you know, crime in the United States. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=400.82s)]
*  You know, you can weaken it. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=403.66s)]
*  You can hopefully lower it. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=405.90000000000003s)]
*  But are you ever going to get rid of crime, just like it's very difficult to get rid of [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=406.98s)]
*  terrorism? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=410.26s)]
*  Hey, Lucas, Charlie here again. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=411.26s)]
*  I was particularly struck by your reporting about planting the flag two miles in. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=413.02000000000004s)]
*  Does that mean at the point at which Israel, the IDF, has planted the flag that behind [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=417.38s)]
*  that is a safe zone now or is Israel, is there no such thing like that in Gaza right now? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=423.78s)]
*  Are they having to continually fight a rearguard action as they progress further into Gaza? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=430.18s)]
*  Not only did, Charlie, did the Israeli forces bring in tanks, they brought in a fleet of [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=438.82s)]
*  bulldozers as well. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=442.62s)]
*  And they just moved in. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=444.06s)]
*  That two miles they've seized is pretty much solid Israeli territory right now. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=445.53999999999996s)]
*  There's been some current skirmishes. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=450.21999999999997s)]
*  Some Hamas fighters have popped out of some caves. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=452.02s)]
*  They were neutralized very quickly. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=454.38s)]
*  Israel certainly has their flag in the ground and a stake of the Gaza Strip right now, and [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=456.73999999999995s)]
*  they're not giving that back anytime soon. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yNlU0F5yY8&t=460.78s)]
