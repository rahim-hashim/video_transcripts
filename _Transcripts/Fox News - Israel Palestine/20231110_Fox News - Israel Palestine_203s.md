# American serving with Israel's Navy says Hamas is the enemy of Israelis and Palestinians
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEoNd1feTKk)
*  Trey Yanks on the ground in southern Israel for us. Good morning, Trey. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEoNd1feTKk&t=0.0s)]
*  Hey, Dana. Good morning. I'm just going to quickly step out of the frame here so you can see what's [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEoNd1feTKk&t=5.76s)]
*  happening as we speak. You'll see some lights there, trails of smoke. Those are cluster munitions [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEoNd1feTKk&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  that the Israelis are firing right now into the northern part of the Gaza Strip. It gives you a [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEoNd1feTKk&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  sense of 35 days into this war, how active the front line here remains. As you noted, rocket [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEoNd1feTKk&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  fire once again by Hamas and Islamic Jihad targeting Israel's second largest city of Tel Aviv today. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEoNd1feTKk&t=26.72s)]
*  The Israelis say 38 of their soldiers have been killed since the ground operation into Gaza began. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEoNd1feTKk&t=32.64s)]
*  They also say overnight they targeted Hamas' elite Nukba forces, those who participated in the October [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEoNd1feTKk&t=38.48s)]
*  7th massacre. The Israelis say they killed a commander and also the head of Hamas' sniper array [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEoNd1feTKk&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  in the northern part of Gaza. As these cluster munitions are fired off, and I just, you're going [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEoNd1feTKk&t=49.84s)]
*  to see it here in a second, so I'm just going to wait for a second before we toss to this [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEoNd1feTKk&t=55.12s)]
*  insert package, but you're going to see once again the sky right here lighting up and these munitions [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEoNd1feTKk&t=59.12s)]
*  hammering the northern part of Gaza. They're trying to hit many of the tunnel entrances in [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEoNd1feTKk&t=65.6s)]
*  the northern part of the Strip because Hamas continues to pop out and ambush Israeli forces. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEoNd1feTKk&t=70.56s)]
*  While all of this is happening, the Israeli Navy is shelling from the sea. They're providing critical [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEoNd1feTKk&t=75.75999999999999s)]
*  support to these infantry troops that are operating across the northern part of Gaza. We join them [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEoNd1feTKk&t=80.47999999999999s)]
*  yesterday for an exclusive look at what that's like. Major Nelson lives in Miami, born and raised [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEoNd1feTKk&t=85.04s)]
*  in Israel to American parents. He's returned to help in the fight against Hamas. Well, first I [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEoNd1feTKk&t=92.4s)]
*  want to thank my brothers and sisters in the United States for this amazing support and we're [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEoNd1feTKk&t=98.0s)]
*  talking about the military support we're getting from the United States. We're talking about the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEoNd1feTKk&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  financial support and many other ways that Israeli American communities and non-Jewish [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEoNd1feTKk&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  communities in the United States are supporting Israel in a unique way. Hamas has continued to [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEoNd1feTKk&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  target Israel from the ground, air and sea. During and after the October 7th massacre, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEoNd1feTKk&t=117.92s)]
*  the Israeli Navy stopped multiple sea infiltration attempts along the coast. Now they look for more. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEoNd1feTKk&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  Right now we're with the Israeli Navy as they patrol the Mediterranean Sea. They're not just [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEoNd1feTKk&t=129.68s)]
*  looking for infiltration attempts but also providing critical surveillance and firepower [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEoNd1feTKk&t=134.48000000000002s)]
*  support to the infantry troops fighting inside Gaza. While thousands of miles away from home, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEoNd1feTKk&t=139.92s)]
*  Major Nelson says he believes Israel will win the ground war against Hamas. He's also acutely aware [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEoNd1feTKk&t=146.16s)]
*  of the parallel information war at home. There's a lack of understanding across the world, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEoNd1feTKk&t=151.92s)]
*  especially when we see all kinds of protests and I see this in my hometown as well back in the United [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEoNd1feTKk&t=157.44s)]
*  States. These people don't understand that the Hamas is not only the enemy of Israel. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEoNd1feTKk&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  Hamas is the enemy of the Palestinians. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEoNd1feTKk&t=166.72s)]
*  As we speak, Israeli forces are operating inside the Gaza Strip. They are surrounding a number of [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEoNd1feTKk&t=171.68s)]
*  hospitals and again I'm just going to step out here so you can see the cluster munitions as they [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEoNd1feTKk&t=178.0s)]
*  land on the northern part of Gaza. But the Israelis have surrounded, according to reports, three [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEoNd1feTKk&t=182.32s)]
*  hospitals. They are urging civilians to evacuate and just yesterday that critical corridor between [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEoNd1feTKk&t=187.28s)]
*  the northern part of Gaza and the southern part. The Israelis say 80,000 Palestinian civilians [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEoNd1feTKk&t=192.56s)]
*  took that route to a safer location. Bill, Dana? Trey Yanks at the border, thank you so much. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEoNd1feTKk&t=198.08s)]
