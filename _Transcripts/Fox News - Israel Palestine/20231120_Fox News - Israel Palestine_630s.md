# Israeli president claims anti-Israel protesters are 'accomplices' to Hamas
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o)
*  Earlier this month, Israeli President Isaac Herzog wrote a letter to the presidents of American universities [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=0.0s)]
*  urging them to fight this rise in anti-Semitism happening on campuses. An [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=5.72s)]
*  excerpt reads, at stake is whether the enlightened world will defend the basic norms of humanity or choose to accept even [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=10.88s)]
*  support their violation. This will either be a teaching moment that moves us toward constructive action or a moment of [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=18.36s)]
*  irreversible decline. Your choices now will shape history and will be remembered. President Isaac Herzog joins us now. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=26.200000000000003s)]
*  President Herzog, thank you and welcome to the program. So which moment is this? Thank you, Sandra. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  Thank you for being here. It's a deciding moment in the fate of [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=39.8s)]
*  world affairs because we are faced between a coalition of hate, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=44.52s)]
*  coalition of a I call it darkness, which is a jihadist coalition which emanates from Tehran with its [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=50.12s)]
*  proxies in Lebanon, in Gaza, of course, by Hamas, in Yemen with the Houthis and of course spreading [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=59.28s)]
*  Islamic fundamentals, jihadism all over the world. If Israel weren't there, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=65.88s)]
*  then Europe will be next and the United States is for sure next because they call the United States [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  the big Satan and that is why I think those protesters who are supporting Hamas, they're actually [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=76.7s)]
*  accomplices to the whole notion that you can butcher young children, that you can chop heads of women, that you can rape [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=84.46000000000001s)]
*  women and pregnant women, that you can abduct old-age Holocaust survivors and you can do a whole bunch of atrocities [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=92.98s)]
*  because you basically support Hamas. That's what they've done and I'm just finished, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=101.26s)]
*  I just finished an immensely moving meeting with family members of over 40 [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=105.66000000000001s)]
*  children who are under captivity as hostages in Gaza by Hamas. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=112.9s)]
*  Children from 10 months old, that's what these protesters are supporting. None of them. Today is International Children's Day. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=118.54s)]
*  I repeat, today is International Children's Day. Where are all these protesters? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=127.06s)]
*  Do they demand the immediate release of these children, let alone the entire group of hostages and all those who have gone through the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=132.38s)]
*  treacherous, horrendous, barbaric attack on 7th of October? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=141.1s)]
*  President Herzog, you mentioned the hostages and this deal that we're starting to learn more details about. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=145.57999999999998s)]
*  Biden officials say this hostage deals, close including negotiations with the US, Israel and Qatari officials, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=152.0s)]
*  that dozens of hostages could be freed of the 240 in coming days. What more can you tell us about that right now? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=158.36s)]
*  Not much really because we are all waiting and we are dealing on the opposite side with the leadership of Hamas, led by Iqya Sinawaz, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=167.4s)]
*  who's basically [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  a psychopath in the way he operates. So nothing that you and I can say really changes the picture. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=179.64s)]
*  We're only waiting for what is the basic humanitarian deed, which is releasing the children and the women [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=186.2s)]
*  and of course all the rest of the hostages. We now learned about two hostages that were murdered, murdered [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=194.2s)]
*  in Gaza. We reported about it in the last few days. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=201.16s)]
*  But because I focused also on the entire picture, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=204.92000000000002s)]
*  let me point out to you another horrendous development of the last day or two and perhaps again in the very near future. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=208.28s)]
*  So this coalition of hate includes a partner in Yemen called the Houthis, the Houthi militias. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=216.68s)]
*  They announced for the first time in history since medieval times that they are going to act as pirates [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=223.64000000000001s)]
*  and take hostage a ship. They've already taken one ship hostage, a major big ship, a Japanese ship [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=232.12s)]
*  with helicopters in the high seas, a ship which was taking goods from Turkey [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=239.8s)]
*  to India and they announced formally that they are new pirates. Today they announced again that they plan to take another ship [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=245.88s)]
*  in a pirate way. Do you believe that in modern times [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=254.44s)]
*  we are seeing piracy again in the high seas? Where is the international community? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=258.68s)]
*  They have to put a stop to it and this is truly under the clear instructions of Iran. Iran gives instructions to the Houthis [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=263.96000000000004s)]
*  and Iran gives them the instructions and the information and the details [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=272.20000000000005s)]
*  about how to operate in the high seas. So this is the battle we're in and the United States is firm [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=276.6s)]
*  both sides of the aisle together with us and many other nations in fighting this coalition of evil. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=283.64000000000004s)]
*  Speaking of the international community to this day the UN still has not condemned Hamas. Why is that? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=289.8s)]
*  Because the UN is a hypocritical organization [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=297.8s)]
*  where they are playing for many many years [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=301.08000000000004s)]
*  with anti-semitic language and rhetoric ongoing every year, automatic resolutions against Israel. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=304.76000000000005s)]
*  Some they even forgot that they passed but they pass every year [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=311.48s)]
*  and it's a kind of an automatic majority [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=315.40000000000003s)]
*  rather than saying the truth because we all know the truth. There is mileage in this sadism [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=319.48s)]
*  and I've seen this footage. I've seen this footage is amazing. I mean it's so atrocious to see how [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=325.96000000000004s)]
*  thousands of Palestinians in Gaza [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=333.62s)]
*  celebrate the dead body, the mutilated body of a young girl who was celebrating in a nature festival. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=336.28000000000003s)]
*  This is the whole clash of civilizational values that we're in. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=344.12s)]
*  President Herzog, I want to talk about the ground operations in Gaza as Israel is expanding these operations in northern Gaza. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=349.8s)]
*  U.S. officials say they're concerned about potential operations in southern Gaza. Thousands of civilians as we know have fled there. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=357.56s)]
*  Mr. President from the north under evacuation orders. Deputy National Security Advisor Jonathan Finer said this. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=365.64s)]
*  There is a real concern because hundreds of thousands of residents of Gaza [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=374.12s)]
*  have fled now from the north to the south at Israel's request and we think that their operation should not go forward until [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=379.0s)]
*  those people, those additional civilians have been accounted for. To that you say what Mr. President? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=387.4s)]
*  That indeed as Mr. Finer said they are accounted for meaning there's a whole infrastructure down south [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=396.12s)]
*  which accommodates civilians who have left the northern part because it's a war zone and because in their homes [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=403.88s)]
*  we find now in schools huge amount of [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=411.4s)]
*  missiles and grenades and bombs and mortars and what's not in schools. We find it of course in the hospitals. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=415.3s)]
*  We showed the world yesterday how the abduction and the kidnapping was taking place also in hospitals. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=423.32s)]
*  We have been claiming this for years and above that's what you see above ground. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=431.16s)]
*  Underneath it is a huge terror city. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=437.70000000000005s)]
*  Huge, I mean you're talking about tunnels that can carry lorries and cars and jeeps and so forth and so on. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=441.08000000000004s)]
*  Billions of dollars being invested there by some taxpayers money from western countries who wanted to help the Gaza people. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=448.44s)]
*  Legitimately we all were in favor of it, but the money was laundered and taken for the use of terror. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=456.9s)]
*  And we are uprooting a major terror infrastructure, which is threatening the entire Middle East and we have to build now [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=463.56s)]
*  the future of how it will look like afterwards so that there will be hope [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=471.08s)]
*  for the people of Gaza so that they will be able to live in peace in democratic circumstances. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=475.88s)]
*  Mr. President, we have a photo of what you say are Hamas terrorists using children [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=482.04s)]
*  as shields as they fight Israeli troops. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=488.68s)]
*  Can you tell us about this? Often this is happening? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=492.84000000000003s)]
*  It's actually happening for years, unfortunately. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=497.88s)]
*  Now in the battleground at times what they have done, I mean they carry their terror operations from [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=501.32s)]
*  living rooms, from children's bedrooms, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=509.0s)]
*  from mosques, from shops. When the world says to us you have the right for self-defense [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=511.8s)]
*  or the American administration correctly says the duty for self-defense, meaning defending our people. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=518.44s)]
*  The problem is that the enemy operates from civilian premises [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=525.56s)]
*  and as such we found, I exposed a few like a week ago, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=530.1999999999999s)]
*  Adolf Hitler's book, Mein Kampf, the book that was the actually the starter [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=535.16s)]
*  for the horrific events of World War II and the Holocaust, which is the worst genocide in human history [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=542.04s)]
*  of Jews, that was of Jews. Mein Kampf was found in a living room which was used as a [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=549.4799999999999s)]
*  war operating room by Hamas against Israeli civilians. From there they launched missiles. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=556.3599999999999s)]
*  Does any American citizen have a missile in his bedroom, living room, or garden? Does any American [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=564.28s)]
*  or decent person in the world take children after chopping their parents and take them into [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=571.3199999999999s)]
*  this cellar somewhere and tortures them? This is what we're going through. This is a battle [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=578.8399999999999s)]
*  between evil and good, period. I've got to leave it there, Mr. President, if I could just leave off [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=585.4s)]
*  where we began, are you optimistic on those hostages? We are praying. We are doing our best [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=591.0799999999999s)]
*  to bring them back home. We are demanding, we are calling upon the international community [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=599.3199999999999s)]
*  to be as forceful as possible, also to point out to Iran and of course all the brokers that are [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=605.0s)]
*  dealing with this and demand the immediate release of all of the hostages, definitely the [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=611.64s)]
*  women and children, and we hope and pray that there will be a positive outcome in the next few days. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=617.16s)]
*  Okay, President Herzog, we appreciate you joining us today. Thank you very much. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=622.68s)]
*  Thank you very much, Sandra. Thank you. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOLbcl1Am2o&t=626.92s)]
