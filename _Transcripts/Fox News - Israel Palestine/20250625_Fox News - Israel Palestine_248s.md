# Leavitt: Leaker of intel report should go to jail
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw)
*  Thank you both. Good afternoon, everybody. I'm Martha McCallum, and this is the story [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=0.0s)]
*  Iran admitting that US and Israeli strikes quote badly damaged their nuclear facilities. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=5.18s)]
*  Here is the Foreign Ministry spokesperson today. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=12.44s)]
*  Yes, our nuclear installations have been badly damaged. That's for sure because it has come [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=15.8s)]
*  on the repeated attacks by Israeli and American aggressors. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=25.64s)]
*  And then for Israel's part, they say that their assessment is that the strikes have [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=30.6s)]
*  set back Iran's nuclear program by quote many years. We know that intelligence by Israel [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=35.24s)]
*  in Iran has been very astute in recent weeks and months. So now President Trump saying [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=40.92s)]
*  that the United States and Iran will hold some discussions next week. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=46.6s)]
*  When I saw them starting to question the caliber of the attack, was it bad? It was really bad. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=53.96s)]
*  It was devastating. They obliterated. We destroyed the nuclear. In other words, that's destroyed. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=61.72s)]
*  I said Iran will not have nuclear. Well, we blew it up. It's blown up. The kingdom come. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=66.32s)]
*  I think the war ended actually when we hit the various nuclear sites with the planes. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=73.88s)]
*  I mean, that's an interesting part of that statement this morning. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=79.64s)]
*  The president also posting that Iran after the strikes that happened during Operation Midnight Hammer, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=83.92s)]
*  the next thing that followed from Iran was that they gave the United States a heads up and said, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=90.84s)]
*  we're going to be launching an attack as ineffectual as it was, thankfully, on our base in Qatar, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=95.56s)]
*  which suggests that it was a face saving move for Iran, that they were really back on their heels [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=101.24s)]
*  to say the least at that point, but needed to demonstrate some sort of reaction for their home audience. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=107.36s)]
*  Now, Brad Wenstrup is going to join us from the president's intelligence advisory board. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=113.76s)]
*  First, we go, though, to senior White House correspondent Peter Ducey reporting live near the Hague [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=118.6s)]
*  in the Netherlands as we cover the NATO meetings. Hi, Peter. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=123.4s)]
*  And Martha, President Trump told us here that the United States has now collected additional [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=129.76s)]
*  intelligence on the ground in Iran since 24 hours ago when that DIA assessment that was released with low confidence [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=135.48s)]
*  revealed that some Iranian nuclear facilities may have been intact. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=144.04s)]
*  They didn't see it. All they can do is take a guess. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=150.28s)]
*  Now, if you take a look at the pictures, if you take a look how it's all blackened, you know, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=153.64s)]
*  the fire and brimstone is all underground because it's granite and it's all underground. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=157.4s)]
*  You don't show it. But even there, with all of that being said, the whole area for 75 yards around [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=162.0s)]
*  the whole where it hit is black with fire. The director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=170.08s)]
*  now says new intelligence confirms what POTUS has stated numerous times. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=177.04000000000002s)]
*  Iran's nuclear facilities have been destroyed. If the Iranians choose to rebuild, they would have to [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=180.96s)]
*  rebuild all three facilities in the Tans, Fordo, Esfahan entirely, which would take years to do. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=186.16s)]
*  The FBI leak investigation is ongoing. And a few minutes ago on Capitol Hill, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=193.68s)]
*  we heard from the White House about how severely they want the person who leaked that DIA intel punished. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=198.56s)]
*  I understand the FBI is investigating who was the source of that leak because it's an illegal leak to CNN. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=207.2s)]
*  What kind of consequence could the leak have faced? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=212.8s)]
*  They should go to jail. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=215.36s)]
*  Jail time. And the White House is hinting that they think the leak came from Capitol Hill because [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=219.04000000000002s)]
*  we are also now told the White House is going to start limiting the classified information that [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=223.44000000000003s)]
*  they share with lawmakers as a direct result of this leak 24 hours ago. Martha. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=228.32000000000002s)]
*  Thank you very much, Peter. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=234.48000000000002s)]
*  Get it anywhere else. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdfuhXhciw&t=245.36s)]
