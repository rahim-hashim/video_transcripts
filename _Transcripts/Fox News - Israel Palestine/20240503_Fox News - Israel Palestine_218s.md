# Iran reportedly gleeful over college protests: Former New York governor
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [May 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE)
*  Bring in former New York Republican Governor George Pataki, who joins us now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=0.0s)]
*  Governor, always good to see you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=4.48s)]
*  We haven't heard from you since all of this started happening in New York. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  And when you look at those scenes inside Hamilton Hall at Columbia University, and let's pop [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=10.52s)]
*  this picture up for the governor, it's a tent. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=16.16s)]
*  And on the outside of the tent, it says, crush one campus, another rises. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=18.56s)]
*  What's your take on this, Governor? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  You know, Martha, this is just disgusting, and it shouldn't be tolerated. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=27.04s)]
*  These are not acts of free speech or protest. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  These are acts of anarchy. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=34.12s)]
*  And they should have been stopped on day one. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=35.6s)]
*  The university administrators should have stopped it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  They didn't. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=40.24s)]
*  When they didn't do it, since they're clearly breaking the law, the law enforcement, the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=41.24s)]
*  NYPD in New York and others across the country should have been called in right away. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=45.64s)]
*  You know, Martha, in 1968, the last time Columbia had riots like that, I was there. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=50.58s)]
*  And I was very active leading some of the anti-protesters. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=55.48s)]
*  And the longer it goes, the more propensity the violence there is. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  So it should have been shut down day one. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=63.76s)]
*  It wasn't. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=65.86s)]
*  I hope it's shut down across the country right now. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=66.86s)]
*  You know, Mayor Adams has also said that there should be no tolerance for this. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=72.19999999999999s)]
*  And here he is speaking out about the flags. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=78.24s)]
*  We've seen Palestinian flags rising in different areas on some of these campuses. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=82.04s)]
*  So I want to play what he said. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=86.4s)]
*  And then, Control Room, if you could play right after that, the video that we have of [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=87.92s)]
*  the NYPD putting the American flag back up at City College. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=91.76s)]
*  Watch this if you would, Governor. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=96.0s)]
*  It's despicable that schools will allow another country flag to fly in our country. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=97.80000000000001s)]
*  So blame me for being proud to be an American. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  And I thank Commissioner Dorothy for putting that flag back up. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=109.48s)]
*  We're not surrendering our way of life to anyone. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=113.04s)]
*  And here's the video, which reminds us of several other historic images. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=120.12s)]
*  As the flag came down, the Palestinian flag came down, and the NYPD launched the American [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=125.08000000000001s)]
*  flag in the middle of all this chaos. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=130.28s)]
*  Governor, what do you think? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=132.12s)]
*  I'll tell you, it makes me proud of Mayor Adams and it makes me proud of the NYPD. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=134.6s)]
*  But I've always been proud of them. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=139.04000000000002s)]
*  But the other side of the coin is, I'm so appalled by the university administrators. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=140.96s)]
*  They should all be fired. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=146.0s)]
*  I'm appalled by President Biden. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=147.16s)]
*  He has been silent for weeks until he finally put out a relatively meaningless statement [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=148.88s)]
*  this morning. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=153.96s)]
*  This is the worst anti-Semitic incidents I've seen in my lifetime. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=154.96s)]
*  The fact that the leadership, whether it's at the university level or at the administration, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=161.0s)]
*  Biden level, has been so silent is appalling. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=166.32s)]
*  This is not free speech. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=169.16s)]
*  This is anarchy. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=171.04s)]
*  You allow it to continue. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=172.2s)]
*  It hurts the country. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=173.67999999999998s)]
*  And Martha, by the way, I don't know if your viewers are aware, but the Iranian national [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=174.67999999999998s)]
*  television has been playing these protests in Iran. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=178.94s)]
*  Al Jazeera has played them all across the Middle East. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=183.48s)]
*  This hurts the peace process. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=187.07999999999998s)]
*  This empowers the radicals like Hamas. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=189.38s)]
*  And whether or not it's intentional by those protesters, it is hurting the prospect for [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=192.38s)]
*  peace. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=197.9s)]
*  It's got to be stopped. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=198.9s)]
*  They should be arrested. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=199.9s)]
*  They should be prosecuted and students should be expelled. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=200.9s)]
*  Yeah, there's no doubt that Iran sees this as a win for them when they see these protesters [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=203.7s)]
*  and what they're doing on college campuses. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=211.22s)]
*  Governor George Pataki, thank you. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=214.02s)]
*  Always great to see you, sir. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=215.62s)]
*  Thank you for joining me today. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbJIIvp0PE&t=216.88s)]
