# US military on 'high alert' for imminent threat from Iran
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA)
*  A Fox News alert the U.S. military is on high alert as Iran signals it could carry out a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=0.0s)]
*  strike on Israel in coming days. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=6.9s)]
*  Iran's supreme leader says when they attacked our consulate area it was like they attacked [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=9.620000000000001s)]
*  our territory. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=14.48s)]
*  The evil regime must be punished and it will be punished. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=15.700000000000001s)]
*  Tensions hit a new high after an IDF airstrike killed a top Iranian general in Syria last [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=20.34s)]
*  week. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=25.82s)]
*  I'm here with a congresswoman Nancy Mace, sits on the Armed Services Committee and she [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=26.82s)]
*  joins me now. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=30.62s)]
*  Congresswoman, good morning to you. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=31.62s)]
*  This attack by Iran is considered inevitable by senior intel officials. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=33.54s)]
*  What are you hearing about this? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=40.94s)]
*  What should we know about it? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=42.18s)]
*  Well, it is inevitable when you have weakness in the White House because what we're seeing [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=43.74s)]
*  before our eyes live, Joe Biden marching the United States into war in the Middle East. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=49.3s)]
*  He's played footsie with Iran, he's played both sides with Iran and the United States [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=55.26s)]
*  has a moral obligation because of our support for democracy, our support for Israel. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=59.98s)]
*  We have a moral obligation to support Israel. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=64.94s)]
*  But it wasn't too long ago when Donald Trump was president and our enemies feared him. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=67.82s)]
*  This would never happen under Donald Trump because when Iran did misbehave he took out [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=71.92s)]
*  Soleimani. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=77.5s)]
*  He killed a nuclear deal with Iran. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=78.5s)]
*  There was peace through strength because there was strength in the White House and our enemies [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=80.8s)]
*  feared him. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=83.86s)]
*  This is what weakness looks like. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=84.92s)]
*  But there's also concern, Congresswoman, that this attack might not just target Israel, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=86.60000000000001s)]
*  it could also target American assets in the region. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=92.18s)]
*  And if this comes directly from Iran, not its proxies, then what? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=94.84s)]
*  Well, right, that is the million dollar question. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=99.8s)]
*  But we've already seen Iranian proxies attack United States troops in the Middle East. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=103.0s)]
*  We've seen the Houthis. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=107.2s)]
*  We've seen folks aligned with Iran trying to harm U.S. soldiers, putting them in harm's [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=108.84s)]
*  way. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=114.64s)]
*  But again, this is why November is so important. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=115.64s)]
*  We don't want to be in war in the Middle East. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=118.84s)]
*  We don't want to be in war anywhere. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=120.44s)]
*  And while this is happening, the left is flailing over Russia because of the situation in Ukraine. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=122.26s)]
*  And it's a really unstable world out there, which is why we need a stronger leader as [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=127.24s)]
*  president of the United States. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=132.2s)]
*  President Biden commented about this Iran threat to Israel yesterday. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=134.12s)]
*  Take a listen to what he had to say. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=137.48s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=141.4s)]
*  Well, I can read it for you because we're having a little trouble with that sound bite. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=142.4s)]
*  But he said, we also want to address the Iranian threat to launch a signal that we're threatening [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=146.12s)]
*  a significant attack on Israel. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=151.24s)]
*  As I told Prime Minister Netanyahu, our commitment to Israel's security against these threats [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=154.8s)]
*  from Iran and its proxies is ironclad. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=159.16s)]
*  So he says that we're showing a picture of him shaking Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=162.36s)]
*  hand there. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=167.0s)]
*  But he also did an interview with Univision Congresswoman a few days ago, and he described [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=168.08s)]
*  Netanyahu's war policy as a mistake, adding, I don't agree with this approach. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=173.2s)]
*  This near daily criticism of Israel is clearly a political calculation. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=178.48s)]
*  But beyond politics, what sort of effect does this rhetoric have when it comes to the war [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=182.86s)]
*  itself? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=187.12s)]
*  Well, it weakens Israel's position, quite frankly. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=188.12s)]
*  And what you just saw there was Joe Biden playing both sides, also demanding ceasefires, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=192.0s)]
*  criticizing Israel and their leader, shows weakness in the region for the United States, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=197.32s)]
*  even though we have a moral obligation to support them. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=202.2s)]
*  You know, so this weakens our position, weakens our allies in the region, and makes Iran feel [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=206.44s)]
*  emboldened, which is what we're seeing today. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=213.92s)]
*  So Congresswoman, there's also a lot going on with FISA, and you were one of 19 Republicans [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=217.38s)]
*  to vote no on advancing the surveillance bill that allows the government to track the communications [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=221.6s)]
*  of suspected terrorists. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=227.38000000000002s)]
*  Why were you a no vote on that one? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=229.26000000000002s)]
*  Well, we need to have a real discussion, debate and reform to FISA. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=231.74s)]
*  I am a constitutionalist, constitutional conservative, and we should not be spying on American citizens, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=237.10000000000002s)]
*  law abiding American citizens, without a warrant. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=243.58s)]
*  And that's what this is about at the end of the day. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=246.3s)]
*  What you're seeing yesterday with the 19 Republicans, and then what you'll see continue today, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=248.5s)]
*  is a negotiation of how we move forward on FISA. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=253.14000000000001s)]
*  This is not, in my opinion, put it into jeopardy, but also we are demanding, you know, that [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=257.18s)]
*  this be reformed, with real reforms that protect all Americans. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=261.94s)]
*  And that's what this is about at the end of the day. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=265.98s)]
*  We had this opportunity to kill the bill yesterday. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=267.54s)]
*  That's what we did, and we're in negotiations today on how we move forward with more reform. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=270.5s)]
*  So what does the path forward to FISA, this FISA program, look like? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=275.5s)]
*  You have FBI Director Christopher Wai say that it's critical that this does pass. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=278.54s)]
*  And it is true that if a suspected terrorist is talking to an American overseas, that communication [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=284.14000000000004s)]
*  can get swept up along with the suspected terrorist communication. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=289.62s)]
*  But there are already laws in place that say that you do need a warrant to then investigate [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=296.14000000000004s)]
*  that American citizen. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=300.70000000000005s)]
*  What this new thing that Republicans are trying to pass now would essentially add a second [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=302.94s)]
*  warrant onto that. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=307.70000000000005s)]
*  So where does your concern lie here? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=308.74s)]
*  Well, the last person I trust on warrantless spying of American citizens is Christopher [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=312.38s)]
*  Wai. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=317.66s)]
*  I don't want to hear how serious he is about national security when the Biden administration [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=318.66s)]
*  has a wide open border. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=323.22s)]
*  They're letting evil people in every single day, including terrorists on the terrorist [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=324.82s)]
*  watch list. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=328.90000000000003s)]
*  They won't shut it down. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=330.02000000000004s)]
*  They won't do anything with regards to national security at the southern border. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=331.1s)]
*  He's the last person I'm going to listen to on national security. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=334.58000000000004s)]
*  What we ought to do is make sure that citizens are not being spied on illegally. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=337.82s)]
*  There are FISA court abuses. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=343.26s)]
*  We know that they exist. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=345.46s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of abuses have existed over the years. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=347.06s)]
*  And we need to make sure that we protect the rights of all American citizens while at the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=350.9s)]
*  same time protecting our nation's sovereignty and our nation's security. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=354.98s)]
*  Congresswoman Mays, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=359.22s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=362.06s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=363.06s)]
*  And I'm Ainsley Earhart. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=364.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaCmahISZSA&t=365.06s)]
