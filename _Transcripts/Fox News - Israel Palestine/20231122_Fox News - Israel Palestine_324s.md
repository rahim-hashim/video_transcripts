# This is why the Hamas hostage deal could backfire: Jonathan Gilliam
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI)
*  Let's bring in former FBI Special Agent and Navy SEAL Jonathan Gilliam. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=0.0s)]
*  Look, Jonathan, certainly a wonderful development. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=3.84s)]
*  Everybody wants the release of these hostages. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  But there are also reasons to be concerned, from raising the price of future hostages [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=9.76s)]
*  to giving Hamas time to reload. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=15.56s)]
*  What's your biggest worry with this deal? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=17.72s)]
*  Well, my biggest worry first and foremost is that you can't trust anything Hamas says. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=20.44s)]
*  They're Iran. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=26.96s)]
*  And basically, when you speak to Hamas, you speak to Iran. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=27.96s)]
*  And you can't trust any of them. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=31.28s)]
*  That's the first problem. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=33.36s)]
*  The second problem is when Israel pauses, it gives Hamas the ability to relocate with [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=34.36s)]
*  wherever they are in Gaza. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=40.68s)]
*  It gives them time to move the rest of the hostages. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=43.72s)]
*  And this is something everybody needs to realize is that when you make bargains with bad guys [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=47.019999999999996s)]
*  to get hostages, and they still have more hostages, you may actually be causing more [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=52.3s)]
*  problems because you're losing leverage on the enemy. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=58.66s)]
*  And that's my worry. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=63.54s)]
*  I mean, I'm happy that they're getting these 50 people out. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=64.53999999999999s)]
*  There's no doubt about that. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=67.7s)]
*  It's 50 lives saved. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=68.69999999999999s)]
*  But at the same time, there's still a massive amount of hostages there and an incredible [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=70.42s)]
*  number of Hamas fighters that are tactically going to use this five-day pause to their [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=75.34s)]
*  advantage. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=81.58s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=82.58s)]
*  This deal would release about one-fifth of the Israeli hostages. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=83.58s)]
*  So the work certainly continues. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=86.66s)]
*  We're also learning that there have been now 66 attacks on U.S. forces since October [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=90.14s)]
*  17th. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=94.98s)]
*  And yesterday, the U.S. hit back, this time in Iraq, hitting a facility used by Iranian [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=95.98s)]
*  proxies. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=100.7s)]
*  There are a lot of Republican lawmakers, Jonathan, who feel like our response hasn't been strong [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=101.7s)]
*  enough. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=106.74s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=107.74s)]
*  And if not strong enough, what should we be doing? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=108.74s)]
*  Well, it's—I mean, it's not strong enough, because what actually is it doing? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=112.17999999999999s)]
*  I mean, you're hitting random places. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=116.69999999999999s)]
*  This reminds me of the Bill Clinton days, when he—something would happen, he would [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=119.14s)]
*  just hit random places that wouldn't affect anything, tactically or strategically. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=123.25999999999999s)]
*  So I don't think that these blows that we're sending out there are doing any damage in [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=128.85999999999999s)]
*  the long run to stop Iran again. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=136.22s)]
*  These are all Iran—or Iranian fighters, no matter which place you go, that's the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=139.54000000000002s)]
*  same group. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=144.06s)]
*  We have to figure out how, first of all, how to get Trump back in office. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=146.26000000000002s)]
*  I mean, that's the first thing, because Biden, as we look at him historically, does [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=151.66s)]
*  not react to any of these things properly, if he reacts at all. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=156.18s)]
*  And the second thing we need to do is start figuring out a way to take Iran, the leadership [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=161.70000000000002s)]
*  in Iran, to take them either down a notch or just take them out, because when you do [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=169.58s)]
*  that, you take away the problems, the majority of the problems that we see right now. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=175.74s)]
*  You mentioned that you don't trust Hamas. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=180.78s)]
*  I think that is a logical conclusion. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=182.58s)]
*  I don't think any of us trust Hamas. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=184.54000000000002s)]
*  My big concern is this notion that, yes, women and children will be released, but teenagers [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=185.9s)]
*  are considered children, and a lot of these teenagers are basically the same as an adult [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=190.66s)]
*  male and can continue to commit terror acts. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=194.85999999999999s)]
*  There's also what Jeff Paul mentioned, the logistics of getting these Israeli hostages [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=197.9s)]
*  from point A to point B, then back to point A, making sure that they are safe. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=203.16s)]
*  Describe the logistics from your perspective as somebody who needs to secure a location [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=208.42s)]
*  and the lack of trust that you have in Hamas to ultimately follow through on their promises. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=211.94s)]
*  Well, just like we've seen when they try to move Palestinians out, they use that as an [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=219.74s)]
*  opportunity to gain leverage using propaganda. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=225.14s)]
*  They either shoot or kill their own people and then blame it on Israel. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=230.57999999999998s)]
*  And my fear is, as they move these people out, that they will do something nefarious. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=235.42s)]
*  I mean, look at the atrocities that they committed before. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=240.98s)]
*  It would not surprise me if this backfires and they kill these hostages in plain view, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=245.34s)]
*  thumbing their nose at Israel. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=253.34s)]
*  But logistically, clearing an area where you can bring them out takes a tremendous amount [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=255.5s)]
*  of people and firepower and overwatch. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=261.32s)]
*  And as I was mentioning to someone the other day, yesterday, last night when I was on Fox, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=264.5s)]
*  a former IDF soldier, Israel doesn't ask for help. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=269.74s)]
*  And just after 9-11, all of our allies came together. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=275.58s)]
*  We went to the Middle East. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=278.42s)]
*  We fought that fight together. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=279.42s)]
*  I wish Israel and the United States and any other allies would do the same in this case [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=280.94s)]
*  and help them in securing this area so they can move faster. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=286.74s)]
*  The response I got from the former IDF soldier was that Israel doesn't need help, they just [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=292.22s)]
*  need support. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=295.86s)]
*  And my response to him would have been, well, you wouldn't be in this situation if you [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=296.94s)]
*  didn't need help. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=300.42s)]
*  And right now, this is the world's fight because as we saw with the Houthis, the more that [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=301.5s)]
*  this progresses, the more it's a problem for the entire world. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=306.9s)]
*  Yeah, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called this a lull in fighting, not a ceasefire or [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=311.74s)]
*  a pause. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=316.02s)]
*  He also says we are at war and we will continue the war until we achieve our goals. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=317.02s)]
*  Jonathan, thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut6JqvHcUtI&t=321.22s)]
