# Israel, Hezbollah trade rocket fire as world demands cease-fire
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [September 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE)
*  We are back with a Fox News alert and right now the IDF is continuing strikes on Hezbollah [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=0.0s)]
*  terror targets in Lebanon as world leaders renew calls for a ceasefire. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=7.0600000000000005s)]
*  Nate Foy on the ground in Tel Aviv with the very latest. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=12.08s)]
*  Nate. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  Todd Carley, good morning. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=16.12s)]
*  So as Israel and Hezbollah continue exchanging fire this morning, the international community [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=18.88s)]
*  attempts to broker a ceasefire and a U.S. official confirms with Fox News that the U.S. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=23.64s)]
*  is in active talks with several countries to do exactly that. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=29.16s)]
*  President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron put out a joint statement last night [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=33.92s)]
*  saying now is the time to stop the fighting on a temporary basis and allow long term negotiations [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=38.0s)]
*  to possibly succeed. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=44.1s)]
*  Here's President Biden last night. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  We put out a statement for 21 day ceasefire along the Israeli-Lebanese border. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  We're able to generate significant support from Europe as well as the Arab nations. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=57.52s)]
*  It's important that war not widen. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=63.52s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu left Israel for New York overnight where he [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  will address the UN later. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=74.52000000000001s)]
*  But Netanyahu's office said this morning that any reports about a ceasefire are incorrect [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=76.80000000000001s)]
*  and he did not respond to the American-French proposal. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=81.36s)]
*  The report about the supposed directive to moderate the fighting in the north is also [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=84.92s)]
*  the opposite of the truth. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=90.16s)]
*  The Prime Minister instructed the IDF to continue the fighting with full force and according [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=92.28s)]
*  to the plans presented to him. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=97.06s)]
*  That's exactly what's happening this morning. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  Take a look at this video. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=100.7s)]
*  The IDF reports it's taken out 75 Hezbollah targets overnight, more than 2,000 targets [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=101.98s)]
*  over the past three days. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=107.36s)]
*  Now as the strikes continue, an Israeli ground offensive may soon be coming in Lebanon. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=109.12s)]
*  Here's IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi speaking to troops in the north. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=114.68s)]
*  We are preparing the process of maneuver, which means your military boots, your maneuvering [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=119.68s)]
*  boots, will enter enemy territory. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=124.68s)]
*  Israel continues taking fire from several fronts. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=129.68s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=132.68s)]
*  The port city of Eilat got hit by a drone attack overnight. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=133.68s)]
*  The Islamic resistance in Iraq took credit for it and two Israelis have minor injuries [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=136.2s)]
*  as a result of that attack. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=140.56s)]
*  Meanwhile, so far this morning, according to the IDF, Hezbollah has fired into northern [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=142.52s)]
*  Israel approximately 45 times. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=146.56s)]
*  We're also learning the small contingent of American troops now headed to the region will [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=149.76000000000002s)]
*  be deployed to Cyprus, an island country in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, to support [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=153.84s)]
*  the 40,000 American troops already in the region. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=158.84s)]
*  We'll send it back to you. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=161.8s)]
*  Alright, Nate, before I lie for us in Tel Aviv, Nate, thank you so much. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=163.0s)]
*  Let's bring in Florida Congressman and Iraq War veteran Cory Mills. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=166.56s)]
*  Congressman, good morning to you. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=169.76000000000002s)]
*  We're talking about major developments here. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=171.06s)]
*  As Nate just mentioned, more U.S. troops are getting sent to the region. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=173.18s)]
*  So what do you think about a ground invasion into Lebanon, the possibility of a broader [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=176.82s)]
*  war and what it could mean for Israel long term if that takes place? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=182.22s)]
*  Well, Carla, let's go ahead and back up and go ahead and try and get to where we were [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=187.26s)]
*  originally from the start, which is that after the October 7th incident that took over 1200 [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=192.06s)]
*  You saw where the Israeli IDF was going after Hamas within their own country and then having [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=197.74s)]
*  to reinstate and re-border the north where they're actually getting anti-tank missiles [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=203.5s)]
*  fired at them by Hezbollah. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=208.06s)]
*  So it was actually Hezbollah who originally started this engagement into Israel. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=209.88s)]
*  We have to keep in mind that General Secretary Hassan Nasrallah, who is the head of Hezbollah, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=213.82000000000002s)]
*  is one of the closest to the Ayatollah regime there in Iran. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=218.5s)]
*  He's also the one that after Qasem Soleimani's successful counterterrorism strike that actually [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=222.72s)]
*  eliminated the former Quds Force leader, that he had his son marry Qasem's daughter to [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=226.72s)]
*  try and ingratiate himself further. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=231.4s)]
*  But this is also the same individual, Carly, that is responsible for the attacks that go [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=233.3s)]
*  on in Iraq against American troops. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=237.38s)]
*  When you think about people like Qatayyib Hezbollah, which actually sits there, or as [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=240.0s)]
*  you just talked about, the fact that the Iraq Islamic revolt is coming forward now and launching [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=243.28s)]
*  attacks against Israel is all because of the connections that Hezbollah has into Iraq. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=249.12s)]
*  So this is a terrorist network that includes Hamas, Qatayyib Hezbollah, and also Hezbollah [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=253.96s)]
*  of Lebanon. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=259.12s)]
*  Israel understands this, and they're taking the fight to them before the fight is taken [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=260.4s)]
*  to them. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=263.36s)]
*  Yeah, Israel has all but defeated Hamas, and now they're turning their attention up north [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=264.36s)]
*  to Hezbollah. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=268.12s)]
*  And you're right, they did start this after October 7th launching rockets. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=269.56s)]
*  They absolutely did. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=273.16s)]
*  Into northern Israel, 60,000 people are displaced. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=274.16s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=277.32s)]
*  Well, that's exactly right. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=279.12s)]
*  And if there was any ceasefire that was going to be put in place for 21 days, what's going [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=280.12s)]
*  to end up happening, and Joe Biden should know this, is that Hezbollah would actually [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=283.76s)]
*  reinforce the border with additional assets, resources, and troops. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=287.32s)]
*  So that's actually giving them a reinforcement boundary so that they could potentially launch [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=291.04s)]
*  counteroffensives into Israel as well. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  So we have to be careful of this. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=296.96s)]
*  And if there is a ceasefire agreement, I hope that they text it or page it over to Hasan [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=297.96s)]
*  Nasrallah, and he checks his pager. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=302.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly right. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=303.6s)]
*  President Biden is calling for that, not just that. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=305.44s)]
*  The European Union, some major countries have all called for this 21-day ceasefire, saying [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=308.88s)]
*  that they want to reset things. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=315.24s)]
*  They want to provide space for negotiations. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=318.2s)]
*  Here's John Kirby on that. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=321.08s)]
*  What we want to see is no all-out war between Israel and Lebanon. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=324.4s)]
*  If the goal is to get the families back to their homes, get businesses back up in those [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=330.28s)]
*  kibbutz's and villages, we believe that a war is not the best way to do that, that there [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=336.35999999999996s)]
*  should be, can be, and ought to be time and space for a diplomatic solution here, and [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=340.47999999999996s)]
*  we're going to continue to work on it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=345.35999999999996s)]
*  So the White House's position is that this ceasefire would ramp things down, but you [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=346.91999999999996s)]
*  say that it could ramp things right back up. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=351.03999999999996s)]
*  Well I do, and I think that it gives the Hezbollah fighters an opportunity to try and reinforce [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=355.2s)]
*  their positions. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=359.28000000000003s)]
*  Right now what Israel is doing is they're softening the targets by limiting some of [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=360.28000000000003s)]
*  the key Hezbollah infrastructure, things that would actually be able to utilize their communications [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=363.68s)]
*  or utilize a weapons cache or looking at areas for headquarters or key leaders. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=368.16s)]
*  And so I think that they would be allowed in that 21 days to start repositioning themselves [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=372.72s)]
*  and there would have to be a tremendous amount of further intel by Israel that goes on in [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=376.58s)]
*  the Five-Eye Partnership to be able to locate and continue to track the movements. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=379.96000000000004s)]
*  And so instead of it being a ceasefire, it could actually be a reinforcement by Hezbollah [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=383.44s)]
*  for a counteroffensive. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=387.04s)]
*  A lot of moving parts, a lot of concern in this region and of course how it affects the [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=388.94s)]
*  United States as well. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=393.58s)]
*  Congressman, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=395.14s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVS9tvR6fE&t=397.06s)]
