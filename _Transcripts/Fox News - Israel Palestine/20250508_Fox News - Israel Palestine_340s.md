# Rubio vows crackdown on pro-Hamas agitators: ‘NO LONGER WELCOME’
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA)
*  Wow, they've got a beat going, but there's a lot of hate in that room right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=0.0s)]
*  They hate Jewish Americans and the state of Israel, the Jewish state of Israel. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=20.88s)]
*  A lot of hate on that campus. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=26.04s)]
*  The June 100 mask anti-Israel protester stormed Columbia University's campus in the first [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=27.84s)]
*  major protest since last spring. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=32.48s)]
*  So we've seen this mounting. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=34.24s)]
*  It's getting bigger now. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=36.2s)]
*  This is one of the largest we've seen. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=37.36s)]
*  They took over a part of the main library where students were studying for final exams. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=39.24s)]
*  So they'd better really make sure that they contain themselves, because if you hurt one [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=44.84s)]
*  of those students, just think about that for a second. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=48.8s)]
*  They're not thinking straight. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=53.94s)]
*  As protesters, this is not protected speech. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=55.38s)]
*  This is not civil disobedience. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=58.22s)]
*  This is hands-on violence, hands-on. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  Security officers attempted to hold the line as that mob attempted to occupy that building. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=67.66s)]
*  We have seen this before. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=75.06s)]
*  The NYPD then moved in at the request of the university. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=77.42s)]
*  I have lots of questions about why it took so long, but at least they got there. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=82.24s)]
*  Police arrested around 80 people after students refused to identify themselves or leave the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=85.96s)]
*  building. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=91.44s)]
*  So you know they needed our officers there. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=92.44s)]
*  The protests escalated and spilled out of the university gates and onto the streets [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=94.64s)]
*  where police officers used riot gear to control that mob. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=99.5s)]
*  The Trump administration, which has been cracking down on campus anti-Semitism, took swift action. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=103.34s)]
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio with this. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=108.12s)]
*  We are reviewing the visa status of the trespassers and vandals who took over Columbia University's [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=110.42s)]
*  library. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=115.06s)]
*  Pro-Hamas thugs are no longer welcome in our great nation. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=116.5s)]
*  In Focus Now, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, Republican of New York and House Republican [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=120.58s)]
*  leadership. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=124.94s)]
*  Chair is with me on the Mez in person. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=125.94s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=128.8s)]
*  Your first response to what we saw unfold. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=129.98s)]
*  It is absolutely disgraceful, and it is more, unfortunately, of what we've seen at our quote-unquote [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=133.12s)]
*  most elite institutions. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=137.86s)]
*  This is why President Trump's action to defund places like Columbia, places like Harvard, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=139.94s)]
*  who have refused to protect students on campus. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=145.42s)]
*  We need to have a zero tolerance policy for anti-Semitism, but also for violence, riots [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=148.26s)]
*  and destruction of property. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=154.02s)]
*  Think about this, Harris. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=156.26s)]
*  They are heading into final exams. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=157.26s)]
*  This is a library where students are studying to prepare for final exams, where the focus [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=158.84s)]
*  is on academics. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=163.26s)]
*  And yet what you're seeing at Columbia, which has been fueled over many years because of [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=164.7s)]
*  failure of leadership at the university, is that they run roughshod. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=167.96s)]
*  So I want to thank NYPD and law enforcement, but we need to hold these schools accountable [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=171.58s)]
*  for their failure to address this. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=177.16s)]
*  Well, look, there has been some talk this morning, and I have this question too, and [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=178.72s)]
*  I ask it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=184.72s)]
*  We're waiting for the university to say that it is now time to call the police. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=186.84s)]
*  If you are a Jewish student in that library, you don't feel safe. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=191.22s)]
*  That's your first clue. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=196.12s)]
*  We need help. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=197.36s)]
*  A, why did it take the university so long? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=198.36s)]
*  And I don't have the minute count, but we can just watch the video live. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=201.24s)]
*  Like police were standing out. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=204.08s)]
*  They wanted to help. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=205.32000000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=206.32000000000002s)]
*  So what do we need to do to get these universities to pay attention that the president means [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=207.32000000000002s)]
*  business? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=210.20000000000002s)]
*  What we have seen, particularly since October 7th, the Hamas terrorist attacks against Israel [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=211.20000000000002s)]
*  and then the failure of universities is that these schools are not going to save themselves. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=215.88000000000002s)]
*  These presidents of these universities, these administrators have failed to meet their responsibility [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=220.62s)]
*  to protect the safety of students on campus. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=225.44s)]
*  There have been thousands of Jewish parents who have reached out to my office over the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=228.2s)]
*  course of these past few years that they are having to hire private security. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=231.96s)]
*  They're having to have their students, their children escorted from class to class. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=236.74s)]
*  This should never be happening. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=240.24s)]
*  So the only way we do this is we need to revoke the taxpayer funding. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=241.94s)]
*  These schools are not entitled to taxpayer dollars and they're not meeting their federal [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=246.22s)]
*  requirement to protect the civil rights of all students on campuses. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=250.06s)]
*  So true. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=253.2s)]
*  Places like Harvard don't need that money. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=254.2s)]
*  I mean, we give them $9 billion. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=255.79999999999998s)]
*  They have benefactors that give more than that. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=257.8s)]
*  Well the reality of Harvard is they do need that money and they feel entitled to that [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=259.84s)]
*  money but they should not be entitled. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=263.84s)]
*  It is our responsibility as members of Congress to be good stewards of U.S. taxpayer dollars [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=266.59999999999997s)]
*  and when that money is going to prop up anti-Semitism, when that money is going towards un-American [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=270.36s)]
*  values, that's when it's very important that we revoke that. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=275.84s)]
*  Last quick question for you. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=279.21999999999997s)]
*  Are you concerned about who we've led into the country and what it looks like when people [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=280.52s)]
*  begin to do this quote unquote protesting? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=284.96s)]
*  It's growing out of hand. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=287.5s)]
*  Not just the universities but it can go someplace else. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=288.5s)]
*  These are not protests, Harris. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=292.0s)]
*  These are criminal acts. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=293.65999999999997s)]
*  This is violence. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=294.97999999999996s)]
*  This is rioting. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=295.97999999999996s)]
*  This is destruction of property. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=296.97999999999996s)]
*  And we've seen many of these individuals are on foreign visas. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=299.4s)]
*  I fully support revoking those foreign visas and deporting. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=302.08s)]
*  And the steps that have been taken by President Trump and Secretary Rubio are tremendous. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=305.64s)]
*  We need to keep doing that. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=310.14s)]
*  It also broadens the question as to why aren't we not focused on educating American students? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=311.26s)]
*  You've seen the percentage of foreign students increase. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=316.3s)]
*  These are American institutions. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=319.09999999999997s)]
*  Of course we want to attract the best and brightest but not on Americans. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=320.47999999999996s)]
*  Representative Stefanik, thank you for being with me. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l38qzc6GQkA&t=324.5s)]
