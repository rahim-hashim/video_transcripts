*  National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan headed to Israel today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU21J8X0z94&t=0.0s)]
*  It comes as Israeli officials are reportedly canceling a trip to Qatar to discuss a possible [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU21J8X0z94&t=7.16s)]
*  second hostage release deal. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU21J8X0z94&t=11.96s)]
*  Trey Angs is live in southern Israel with us this morning with more. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU21J8X0z94&t=13.68s)]
*  Good morning to you Trey. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU21J8X0z94&t=17.16s)]
*  Todd Carley, good morning. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU21J8X0z94&t=19.12s)]
*  We know some of these diplomatic efforts this week have failed as fierce battles rage on [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU21J8X0z94&t=22.12s)]
*  in northern and southern Gaza. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU21J8X0z94&t=27.04s)]
*  Overnight yet another Israeli soldier died in fighting bringing the total to at least [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU21J8X0z94&t=29.84s)]
*  116 Israeli soldiers since the ground operation began. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU21J8X0z94&t=34.56s)]
*  On a call with reporters overnight an Israeli official declined to provide specific details [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU21J8X0z94&t=39.64s)]
*  when asked by Fox News about a timeline for securing territory in northern Gaza. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU21J8X0z94&t=44.08s)]
*  That official however did describe what the efforts look like in southern Gaza around [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU21J8X0z94&t=49.32s)]
*  the city of Hanunis explaining that operations are taking place in pockets not with the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU21J8X0z94&t=53.6s)]
*  aim of holding large pieces of land. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU21J8X0z94&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  With the war expected to continue for weeks if not months, US officials continue to weigh [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU21J8X0z94&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  in on the conflict. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU21J8X0z94&t=65.24s)]
*  While we all want the war to end as soon as possible to stop the human suffering and to [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU21J8X0z94&t=67.96s)]
*  establish conditions for an enduring peace, something that the president and the entire [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU21J8X0z94&t=71.16s)]
*  team continues to pursue, a unilateral ceasefire with a terrorist group like Hamas is not the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU21J8X0z94&t=75.36s)]
*  answer. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU21J8X0z94&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  As the president has said Hamas could release the hostages today. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU21J8X0z94&t=82.47999999999999s)]
*  The developments on the ground in Gaza come amid growing regional threats. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU21J8X0z94&t=88.4s)]
*  Yesterday Iran backed Houthi rebels in Yemen launched a drone toward the USS Mason in the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU21J8X0z94&t=91.92s)]
*  Red Sea. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU21J8X0z94&t=96.88s)]
*  That drone was shot down but the threat remains. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU21J8X0z94&t=97.88s)]
*  It's not just the Red Sea, also the arena in southern Israel but also the northern front [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU21J8X0z94&t=100.44s)]
*  that remains active. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU21J8X0z94&t=104.52s)]
*  Today we do understand the Israelis responded with fresh airstrikes against Hezbollah positions [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU21J8X0z94&t=106.12s)]
*  following rocket fire from southern Lebanon. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU21J8X0z94&t=111.32s)]
