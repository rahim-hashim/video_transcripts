# Rep. Mike Waltz: 'We have the prisoners running the prison'
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU)
*  All right, there's a lot of developments to talk about. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's bring in Florida Congressman Michael Waltz. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=1.6400000000000001s)]
*  He is a member of the House Armed Services, Foreign Affairs, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=3.52s)]
*  and Intel Committees. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=5.78s)]
*  Congressman, thank you for hanging with us [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=7.84s)]
*  through the briefing. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=9.96s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=10.78s)]
*  I wanted to ask you about this letter [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=12.0s)]
*  that was sent to President Biden [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=14.32s)]
*  by some 400 political appointees and government staffers [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=15.8s)]
*  across 40 government agencies. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=20.44s)]
*  It was viewed by the New York Times. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=22.96s)]
*  It's highly critical of President Biden's Israel policy. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=25.0s)]
*  It says, quote, in part, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=28.36s)]
*  we call on President Biden to urgently demand a ceasefire [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=30.12s)]
*  and to call for de-escalation of the current conflict [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=33.6s)]
*  by securing the immediate release of the Israeli hostages [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=35.92s)]
*  and arbitrarily detained Palestinians, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=40.24s)]
*  the restoration of water, fuel, electricity, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=42.84s)]
*  and other basic services, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=44.96s)]
*  and the passage of adequate humanitarian aid [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=46.44s)]
*  to the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=48.96s)]
*  The pressure within the administration [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=50.32s)]
*  is building on this president. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  Do you expect that he will remain resilient [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=55.0s)]
*  in the face of it or came? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=57.36s)]
*  Well, first, John, I just want to give credit [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=60.64s)]
*  where credit's due, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=62.44s)]
*  and to see the bipartisan Republican and Democrat support [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=63.4s)]
*  for Israel at the Israel rally out in Washington, D.C. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  was reassuring, but yeah, this letter, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=71.36s)]
*  400 of Biden's political appointees [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=73.68s)]
*  calling for a ceasefire and criticizing him, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=76.68s)]
*  I could tell you under the Trump administration, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=80.4s)]
*  everybody knew who the commander in chief was. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=82.16s)]
*  I guess we have the prisoners running the prison here, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=85.96s)]
*  and what's so disturbing is we know, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=89.56s)]
*  the Israelis are telling us, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=92.88s)]
*  we have analytics that show that Russian and Chinese actors [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=94.64s)]
*  are perpetuating this misinformation [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=100.88s)]
*  about what's going on under Gaza, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  and those same people seem obsessed about it [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=105.72s)]
*  in 2016 in the election, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=108.52s)]
*  but I guess they're just believing their own misinformation. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=110.52s)]
*  At this point, we know, of course, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=114.12s)]
*  Hamas is using human shields, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=116.0s)]
*  of course they're using hospitals. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=117.4s)]
*  There are multiple, multitudes of video and photos [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=119.08s)]
*  from underneath schools, mosques, and hospitals, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=123.92s)]
*  which is a war crime in and of itself, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=126.52000000000001s)]
*  so it is phenomenally disturbing to me [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=129.6s)]
*  that the people charged with our foreign policy [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=133.0s)]
*  are buying into Russian and Chinese misinformation [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=136.36s)]
*  and then pressuring their own commander in chief [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  who appointed them to go down this disastrous path [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=142.28s)]
*  of a ceasefire. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=146.04s)]
*  You know, Congressman, to your point taken [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=147.72s)]
*  about the Trump administration, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  nobody questioned who was in charge, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=151.88s)]
*  however, there were plenty of people [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=154.36s)]
*  who were embedded within these agencies and departments [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=155.96s)]
*  who were dishing dissension about the president's policies [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=160.56s)]
*  at every opportunity they possibly could have. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=165.96s)]
*  Yeah, John, that's why we call it the deep state, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=169.28s)]
*  and that's why we, I mean, truly, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=171.16s)]
*  we need to clean house there, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=172.6s)]
*  and at the end of the day, the commander in chief [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=175.76s)]
*  in the executive branch is the only one elected. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=179.68s)]
*  Everybody else is appointed and serves at his pleasure [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=182.24s)]
*  or as a civil servant. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=186.84s)]
*  They didn't put their name on the ballot. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=188.44s)]
*  If they wanna go start dictating policy, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=189.96s)]
*  then go run for office. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=192.20000000000002s)]
*  I wanted to ask you about this independent assessment [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=193.8s)]
*  that was articulated by John Kirby aboard Air Force One [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=196.20000000000002s)]
*  and again by Sabrina Singh at the Pentagon. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=199.12s)]
*  The US intelligence now has separately confirmed [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=201.76s)]
*  and apparently downgraded top secret intelligence [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=205.84s)]
*  that Hamas is indeed using these hospitals [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=208.8s)]
*  for military purposes and is intentionally using people [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=212.68s)]
*  who work in the hospitals or people who are patients there [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=216.88s)]
*  as human shields. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=219.8s)]
*  What do you say? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=220.84s)]
*  Well, I'm glad the administration's doing this. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=222.28s)]
*  This is the war of ideas and a counter Hamas, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  China and Russia's, and Iran's propaganda [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=227.96s)]
*  that we need to do to show that evidence, number one. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=230.8s)]
*  And then number two, of course, John, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=234.56s)]
*  anybody who has dealt with the Taliban, al-Qaeda, Hamas, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=236.12s)]
*  knows the evil that's at play here. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=240.08s)]
*  We know and the Israelis are telling us and showing us [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=242.48000000000002s)]
*  that Hamas is shooting people in the humanitarian corridors. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=246.12s)]
*  They are forcing people to stay in harm's way. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=249.60000000000002s)]
*  They are forcing people to stay in the hospital. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=253.4s)]
*  The Israelis told us they offered a field hospital, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=255.76s)]
*  move the patients out and we'll help take care of them. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=258.56s)]
*  But Hamas is forcing them to stay in Al-Shifa [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=261.72s)]
*  because they know that at the end of the day, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=264.4s)]
*  they care more about the propaganda value [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=267.68s)]
*  than they do their own people's lives. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=270.16s)]
*  So what we need to be talking about, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=272.16s)]
*  what we should hear from the president [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=274.0s)]
*  is how do we liberate the Palestinian people from Hamas, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=275.56s)]
*  not the other way around. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=279.72s)]
*  Yeah, so, okay, so there would seem to be a little question [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=281.24s)]
*  if you believe the US intelligence [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=283.96000000000004s)]
*  that Hamas is using these hospitals for military purposes. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=286.24s)]
*  The bigger question is, other than evacuating [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=290.08000000000004s)]
*  all of the patients, and I don't know logistically [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=293.76s)]
*  how you do that, and then leveling the place, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=296.04s)]
*  what do you do about it? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=298.88s)]
*  Well, this is, and this is, I mean, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=301.32s)]
*  I had to do this in Afghanistan. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=303.16s)]
*  You have to go in surgically [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=305.04s)]
*  and take these people out as best you can. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=307.16s)]
*  I'll point out to all of those protesters out there [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=309.88s)]
*  on every college campus, there is a difference [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=312.2s)]
*  between what Hamas did in targeting and torturing, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=314.59999999999997s)]
*  intentionally killing civilians, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=317.52s)]
*  and civilians that are harmed as part of collateral damage [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=319.92s)]
*  in a war that Hamas started. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=323.44s)]
*  You have to do the best you can. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  It puts the IDF in a horrible situation, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=327.0s)]
*  and of course the terrorists know that. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=329.88s)]
*  That's why they do it. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=331.48s)]
*  Yeah, well, I would hazard a guess [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=332.84s)]
*  that if you attacked a hospital that had civilians in it [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=335.59999999999997s)]
*  to get to Hamas, you'd be in a heap [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=339.56s)]
*  of international condemnation. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=343.12s)]
*  We'll see what they could do. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=345.32s)]
*  Very difficult nut to crack, that one, no question. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=346.8s)]
*  Congressman, good to catch up with you. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=350.32s)]
*  Thanks for joining us. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=352.6s)]
*  Thanks for hanging with us again. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jjtlPR1QU&t=353.44s)]
