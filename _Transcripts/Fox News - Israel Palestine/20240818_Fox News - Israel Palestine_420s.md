# The Biden administration holds Israel back: Mike Pompeo
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [August 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho)
*  protesters are expected to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=0.0s)]
*  convention kickoff sees anything like the violent DNC protests in Chicago back in 1968. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=21.64s)]
*  Tens of thousands of anti-Israel protesters vowing to descend on the Windy City streets [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=29.4s)]
*  tomorrow, setting the stage for comparisons to the chaos of the 1968 Democratic convention. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  Let's bring in former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=40.88s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, good to see you. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=43.28s)]
*  No question that anti-Vietnam demonstrators were very committed back in 1968, but so it [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=44.92s)]
*  would seem our anti-Israel protesters these days based on what we saw earlier this year. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=51.36s)]
*  Here's what the New York Post said about what might be ahead. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=58.16s)]
*  Roughly 100,000 anti-Israel protesters expected to descend on Chicago to steal the spotlight [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  from the DNC Harris Walls ticket. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=66.72s)]
*  What are you expecting in Chicago this week? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  Well, John, Sandra, it's great to be with you. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=72.56s)]
*  I do hope that the Chicago police are prepared, that the sheriff's offices are prepared to [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=76.12s)]
*  make sure that there's not violence, there aren't people injured. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=81.2s)]
*  But second, we know that these protesters, they may be anti-Israel, I think that's true. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=83.76s)]
*  But remember, these are the same people. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  And frankly, I think some of them just paid and don't even know why they're there. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=90.8s)]
*  But the leadership of these protests, John, the leadership of these protests is pro-Islamist, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  hardcore left, progressive, believe deeply that America's place in the world is indecent [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=99.80000000000001s)]
*  and that the problem is us, the United States and Israel, and not these Islamist terrorists. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=105.16s)]
*  This is a view that is antithetical to the most fundamental ideas of America. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=110.08000000000001s)]
*  And sadly, they're there in Chicago because they think their presence can sway the Democrat [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=113.80000000000001s)]
*  Party even further to their side. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=119.04s)]
*  And we have seen that. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=121.2s)]
*  We've seen it in the Biden administration where they've demanded Israel conduct a ceasefire [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=122.4s)]
*  10 months ago, John, before the Israelis even had a chance to take out any part of [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=130.0s)]
*  The Biden administration has been holding back Israel from securing its own sovereignty [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=131.0s)]
*  for months and months and months and has caused more death and more conflagration. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=135.72s)]
*  And we still have tens of thousands of Israelis that aren't living in their homes from the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=140.6s)]
*  attacks from Hezbollah in the north. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=144.0s)]
*  You still have Americans held hostage, John. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=145.92s)]
*  We don't even, President's mission, Harris won't mention this once, I predict. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=148.27999999999997s)]
*  She won't mention it once in her speech. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=151.6s)]
*  This is what these protesters are doing. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  They are the left anchor of the Democrat Party. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=155.67999999999998s)]
*  And it is sad to see that one of two of America's major parties has succumbed to the progressive [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=158.44s)]
*  pro-Islamist wing inside of their own party. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=163.76s)]
*  Well, certainly Kamala Harris seems to have tried to throw those protesters a bone to [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=166.64s)]
*  a greater degree than President Biden has. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=170.44s)]
*  Listen to what she said after meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=173.28s)]
*  This was back on July the 25th. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=176.28s)]
*  What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=179.48s)]
*  We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=183.56s)]
*  We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=187.07999999999998s)]
*  And I will not be silent. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=191.76s)]
*  But that didn't seem to buy her any points with anti-Israel protesters. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=193.95999999999998s)]
*  They were still heckling her at a rally that she had in Detroit. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=197.23999999999998s)]
*  So she seems to be throwing Israel under the bus to a large degree and not getting any [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=201.22s)]
*  political benefit from it. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=205.84s)]
*  You know, from my life in politics, John, I saw that when you don't know who you are, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=209.6s)]
*  when you don't know what you believe, when you don't stand with core American values, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=213.12s)]
*  you're going to disappoint everyone. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=216.56s)]
*  And that's what these protesters believe. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=218.39999999999998s)]
*  They saw that and they said she'll not be silent. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=220.08s)]
*  And their voices are saying, no, you're not going to be silent. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=222.20000000000002s)]
*  You need to come out for us. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=225.8s)]
*  I predict she'll make no mention of this in her remarks at the convention. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=227.88000000000002s)]
*  She wants to stay as far away from this issue because inside of her party, she knows that [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=232.16000000000003s)]
*  the that the Ilhan Omar wing of her party is strong and capable. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=236.28s)]
*  And frankly, I suspect that she has a lot more sympathy for it than President Biden [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=240.92000000000002s)]
*  does in his heart of hearts. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=244.42000000000002s)]
*  Yes, so an echo of the 1960s the other day at a Harris Waltz rally. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=245.84s)]
*  Listen to what protesters said about Governor Kathy Hochul and New York City Mayor Eric [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=250.35999999999999s)]
*  Adams. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=254.56s)]
*  Kathy Hochul, what do you say? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=256.56s)]
*  How many kids have you killed today? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=261.08s)]
*  Eric Adams, what do you say? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=265.64s)]
*  How many kids have you killed today? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=270.36s)]
*  Wow, yeah, back in the 1960s, 67, 68, the chant was hey, hey, LBJ, how many kids did [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=275.2s)]
*  you kill today? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=280.92s)]
*  I mean, everything old is new again. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=282.48s)]
*  Yeah, time, time sort of look the same in the following sense is that it is such misplaced [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=286.40000000000003s)]
*  anger. The responsibility for every one of these deaths. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=291.8s)]
*  And I agree with Vice President Harris, every death is a tragedy. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=294.84000000000003s)]
*  But the responsibility for these deaths is squarely in Tehran. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=298.52000000000004s)]
*  The responsibility for the hostage being held is squarely in Tehran. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=302.0s)]
*  And the Hamas terrorists, the Hezbollah terrorists are all being funded and underwritten [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=305.88s)]
*  and trained by them. And so to to blame Kathy Hochul or to blame the Israelis for these [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=309.6s)]
*  deaths fundamentally misunderstands what took place there and Israel's obligation to [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=314.8s)]
*  protect its own people. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=318.88s)]
*  So, you know, again, going back to 1968, Mayor Richard Daley was heavily criticized [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=322.48s)]
*  for heavyheaded tactics using Chicago police to try to control the demonstrators. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=328.40000000000003s)]
*  He once infamously issued orders to, quote, shoot to kill arsonists, shoot to maim [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=332.6s)]
*  looters. Mayor Brandon Johnson is promising a softer handed approach, saying, quote, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=338.8s)]
*  we are focused on collaborative solutions and have extended this approach to our [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=344.28000000000003s)]
*  convention preparation to balance the need for security with our commitment to free [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=348.56s)]
*  expression. I mean, maybe Mayor Richard Daley went too far, but is Brandon Johnson [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=353.0s)]
*  going far enough? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=358.92s)]
*  Yeah, I suspect that the protesters aren't looking for collaboration with the mayor. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=362.16s)]
*  I suspect that's the last thing on their mind when they show up in Chicago. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=366.32s)]
*  The law enforcement officers know how to secure the city. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=370.08s)]
*  They frankly they fail to do it every weekend in Chicago because of the failed policies [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=373.47999999999996s)]
*  of of the mayor and and district attorneys like Kamala Harris was when she was a DA [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=377.71999999999997s)]
*  in California. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=382.56s)]
*  Make no mistake, the police are going to have their hands full. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=384.03999999999996s)]
*  And while we want everyone to have the right to speak and protest freely, I suspect that [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=386.96s)]
*  the protesters that are coming to Chicago have different thoughts in their mind and [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=391.71999999999997s)]
*  they're going to make this as difficult for the DNC as they possibly can. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=394.4s)]
*  And the security professionals need to make sure they're prepared for that. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=397.76s)]
*  All right. Well, we will see as the weekend folds. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=401.47999999999996s)]
*  Hey, everyone, I'm Emily Campagno. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=404.12s)]
*  Catch me and my co-hosts, Harris Faulkner and Kaylee McEnany on Outnumbered Every [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qJeH7yX0Ho&t=406.15999999999997s)]
