# Harris' initial Israeli opposition would've left 'sadistic murderer' Sinwar alive, expert says
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ)
*  President Biden also putting out a brand new statement. This is a good day for Israel for the United States and for the world [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's bring in Mark Dubowicz CEO of the foundation for defense of democracies [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=4.76s)]
*  Mark you were listening to the vice president's statement there first up your reaction [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=9.3s)]
*  Well, look it's a good statement well prepared well delivered, you know, unfortunately [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=16.1s)]
*  Vice President Harrison March of this year said I have read the maps and I opposed [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=20.36s)]
*  Israelis going into Rafa in Gaza and she is opposed Israeli operations [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=26.68s)]
*  She's called as John said earlier for the Israelis to stop the war agree to a ceasefire that would have kept Sinwar [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=32.36s)]
*  Alive and would have kept the violence continuing [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=40.28s)]
*  So some acknowledgement that the vice president and the president himself have been wrong to try block Israeli [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=43.46s)]
*  operations because without that there wouldn't have been these soldiers on the ground who [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=50.2s)]
*  Fortunately encountered Sinwar and were able to get rid of a sadistic murderer [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=54.86s)]
*  so [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=59.66s)]
*  To that point mark coming back to what I said about the crux of the statement that she made is that the wars got to end [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=60.86s)]
*  in a way that [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=68.1s)]
*  So that Israel is secure. I mean if the war ends tomorrow or this afternoon [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=70.1s)]
*  Hamas is still going to be in place Hezbollah is still going to be in place it [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=77.34s)]
*  Iran will still present an existential threat to Israel with its nuclear program and [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=81.86s)]
*  And that does seem to be the one thing that the Biden administration [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=86.78s)]
*  Is is not realizing that if you if you don't defeat Hamas in a way that it can't be [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=91.06s)]
*  reconstituted and come back if you don't defeat Hezbollah in a way that they stop threatening Israel with more than a hundred thousand missiles that [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=97.22s)]
*  They likely have left even after this conflict [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=103.62s)]
*  And if you if you don't end this war in a way that Iran does not continue to use its proxies to attack [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=106.18s)]
*  Israel and to also now directly attack Israel with hundreds of ballistic missiles [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=112.62s)]
*  Then then this war will never end in a way that Israel can be secure [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=117.98s)]
*  What else needs to happen in order for that statement to be fulfilled? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=122.34s)]
*  John you're exactly right. Look, I mean the Israelis live in a tough neighborhood. They live in the Mideast not the Midwest [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=130.7s)]
*  And they understand that you know diplomacy without coercion is is our Milly talks [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=136.01999999999998s)]
*  Concessions and capitulation and so what they've done is they've ignored the Biden administration [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=142.7s)]
*  They've ignored Vice President Harris and they've gone out to kill the enemies of America and Israel [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=147.17999999999998s)]
*  Who have as we've said over and over again substantial blood on their hands of our citizens and they're holding them also hostage [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=153.26s)]
*  So thankfully the Israelis realize that now that means that there's an opportunity for coercive diplomacy [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=161.12s)]
*  All right using leverage in order to get a political settlement. This is got to end with a political settlement [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=166.72s)]
*  it's got to end with the destruction of Hamas's military and governance capabilities in Gaza and we are [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=172.48s)]
*  We are further along than we were certainly three four months ago achieving that end [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=179.32s)]
*  It's got to end with the destruction of Hezbollah's military and governance capabilities in Lebanon [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=183.92s)]
*  And it's got to end with the Iranian regime in Tehran [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=188.16000000000003s)]
*  Taking significant blows undermining their power and also supporting the Iranian people millions of whom despise this regime and want to topple this regime [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=193.32000000000002s)]
*  We have a unique opportunity to reorder the Middle East in ways that will promote American national security and promote Arab Israeli [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=202.24s)]
*  Normalization and get rid of these enemies that have been inflicting so much blood and so much violence on the region and against against our citizens [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=210.56s)]
*  Mark, I just want to highlight the screen. We've we've got this live shot up there in Tel Aviv [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=218.08s)]
*  For those wondering obviously we've been calling it a celebration on the ground there in Israel following the confirmation of Sim war's death [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=223.52s)]
*  Specifically, these are families of hostages we are told [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=231.52s)]
*  That are live on our TV screen right now. They're near Israel's defense ministries in Tel Aviv calling for the release of hostages [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=235.0s)]
*  Mark just wanted to make sure we were really specific on what we're showing there [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=243.4s)]
*  To the president's point in his statement mark [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=247.08s)]
*  Part of it reads in quote more than 250 were taken hostage with 101 still missing [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=250.84s)]
*  That number includes seven Americans four of whom are believed to still be alive and held by Hamas terrorists [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=256.76s)]
*  Sinwar is the man most responsible for this [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=263.44s)]
*  So they're obviously hoping this is an opportunity to push harder for the release of those hostages mark [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=267.2s)]
*  Is this a better opportunity for them now? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=273.62s)]
*  It's a much better opportunity look there's still a guy named Khalil Mashal who lives in Doar, Qatar [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=276.84000000000003s)]
*  He's the head of the political wing of Hamas. He's been living there in the lap of luxury in a six-star hotel [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=284.28000000000003s)]
*  He's worth about four billion dollars money that he's stolen from the international community [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=291.08s)]
*  I was supposed to go to help the Palestinian people [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=295.36s)]
*  Well, Mashal is there and Mashal has a choice now he can surrender on behalf of Hamas [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=297.28000000000003s)]
*  He can order the Hamas terrorists to release the hostages Prime Minister Netanyahu has promised to grant immunity [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=302.72s)]
*  to any Hamas leader any Hamas fighter who does so and Mashal can [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=309.24s)]
*  Can can actually bring a resolution? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=315.08000000000004s)]
*  But Mashal has a choice you can do that or there's two other things we can do [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=318.0s)]
*  The first is we can force the Qataris who've been harboring Hamas for many years [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=321.8s)]
*  To extradite Mashal to the United States to stand trial for killing Americans [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=326.84s)]
*  or if he doesn't want to do that then then Mossad will find him and hunt him down and [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=331.68s)]
*  we'll kill him because the Israelis will seek justice for those who have hurt maimed and murdered their citizens and [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=337.08s)]
*  It doesn't matter how long it takes that they will find him [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=343.68s)]
*  This is an opportunity to bring a peaceful resolution or to force the Qataris who are supposedly our great allies [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=346.52s)]
*  Who've done nothing at all to help us in this conflict to finally get Hamas to release American hostages Israeli hostages [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=353.64s)]
*  And as I say bring a resolution to this to that point I was I was thinking [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=361.15999999999997s)]
*  the same thing as you were that if Mashal is now sort of [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=366.12s)]
*  The the heir apparent to Sinwar [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=370.96s)]
*  He was the head of the Hamas political wing until 2017 when Hania took over and then that mantle fell to Sinwar [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=374.28s)]
*  But if now the focus is back on Mashal [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=381.04s)]
*  He's got to feel almost like he's a dead man walking [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=383.56s)]
*  Because this I don't think that the Mossad would go after him in Qatar [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=386.04s)]
*  But the second that he leaves the border of Qatar as we saw with Ismail Hania even in downtown Tehran [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=389.40000000000003s)]
*  The Masada get him [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=396.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean listen you're right [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=400.08000000000004s)]
*  How do Michelle may never leave Doha? I'm not so sure the Mossad is not gonna try targeting there [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=403.20000000000005s)]
*  I mean at the end of the day, you know, it'll have some diplomatic blowback. Well, it'll have diplomatic blowback [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=408.32s)]
*  But look, I think the Israelis have demonstrated after October 7th. They are willing to do whatever it takes [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=413.0s)]
*  And there's things that they may not have been prepared to do before October 7th [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=418.71999999999997s)]
*  So Michelle may never leave but you know again John my preference is the United States has significant leverage over the Qataris [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=422.41999999999996s)]
*  We have an important Air Force base there by the way that protects the Qataris from their enemies [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=428.84s)]
*  And it's about time to force the Qataris to extradite Michelle [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=434.04s)]
*  I want to see him in a in a courtroom in the United States of America [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=437.40000000000003s)]
*  Indicted and then convicted for killing our citizens and then I want to see him in a maximum security prison [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=441.40000000000003s)]
*  Rotting away for the rest of his life after all of the brutal damage [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=447.6s)]
*  He's done [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=450.8s)]
*  I think would be fitting and poetic if he went from a six-star hotel and four billion dollars of net worth [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=451.08s)]
*  To a maximum security prison in a small cell [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=457.16s)]
*  I think that would be poetic and I think it would also bring [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=460.04s)]
*  Again a measure of justice for the Americans and Israelis and others that he's helped kill and maim [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=462.92s)]
*  Mark to continue to update what we are hearing from officials here in the US our Pentagon press secretary major general Pat Ryder [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=468.44s)]
*  Just provided a readout of his phone call with the defense minister the Israeli defense minister Galant [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=476.36s)]
*  discussing the killing of the Hamas leader Sinwar he [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=483.88s)]
*  Reaffirms his support in that call for Israel's right to defend itself and reiterated that the deployment of the terminal high-altitude area defense [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=487.59999999999997s)]
*  That represents the US unwavering enduring an ironclad commitment to Israel's security [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=494.34s)]
*  The secretary also expressed strong support for the immediate release of all remaining hostages and a ceasefire in [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=499.59999999999997s)]
*  Gaza so this is the messaging that we're hearing from US officials upon his death and we await [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=506.24s)]
*  Word from the president which will be an important moment in all of this mark [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=511.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, look center [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=517.08s)]
*  I think these expressions of support are very important obviously some very close US-Israel alliance for many years [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=518.24s)]
*  But we have to be also be [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=523.96s)]
*  somewhat [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=526.08s)]
*  Measured in our praise of the administration look it was only a few days ago the by administration was threatening to cut off [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=528.08s)]
*  ammunition and weapon sales to the Israelis they've done that multiple times in the past 12 months the [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=534.88s)]
*  Actually, it's a very interesting, but the brigade that was responsible for killing [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=541.64s)]
*  Sinwar I was made up of these young soldiers some of them were secular so a 19 year old young [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=545.96s)]
*  Sergeant nine months in his service who supposedly killed sin war but this may not have been publicly reported [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=551.9200000000001s)]
*  But that brigade was also made up of ultra-orthodox religious Israeli soldiers who were part of a a [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=557.52s)]
*  Brigade that the Biden administration was going to sanction only a few months ago [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=564.96s)]
*  So it you know it's sort of very interesting in terms of the symbolism and the praise [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=569.88s)]
*  But one has to be again measured in how we respond to the president the vice president the secretary of defense's [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=574.0s)]
*  Fulsome comments because again that there's been multiple times through about this war where they've really tried to undercut the ability of these really [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcHIu_FCetQ&t=581.84s)]
