# We will find Hamas wherever they are: IDF spokesman
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo)
*  For more on the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, let's bring in Israel Defense Forces [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=0.0s)]
*  spokesperson Jonathan Konrikis. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=6.26s)]
*  He is also a lieutenant colonel in the Israeli reserves. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=8.44s)]
*  So you've heard the criticism that Israel has been getting, especially since the ceasefire [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=13.34s)]
*  ended and it has resumed the attacks in Gaza. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=19.26s)]
*  How do you respond to that as an Israeli soldier? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=23.72s)]
*  Well, good evening. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=29.4s)]
*  It's a really clear situation. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=31.32s)]
*  You know, we bring it down to basics. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=33.199999999999996s)]
*  If we want to prevent another October 7 from happening, there's only one way to do that, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=35.9s)]
*  and that is to make sure that Hamas doesn't ever have the ability to do so. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=41.04s)]
*  And in order for us to ensure that to our civilians, which is our duty, then what we [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=46.08s)]
*  have to do is to find Hamas wherever they are and fight them there. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=52.28s)]
*  Now, it would be convenient and nice if Hamas were out in the open or in the few agricultural [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=57.24s)]
*  areas, not so densely populated areas of Gaza, and if we fought from there. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=63.88s)]
*  Only Hamas isn't. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=69.72s)]
*  They hide underneath cities, they hide within the civilian population, and they use the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=71.18s)]
*  civilian population as their human shields. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=76.56s)]
*  And that is why we have to go there and fight them there. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=79.4s)]
*  And what we're going to do in order to minimize the exposure of civilians is to ask them [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=84.36s)]
*  to leave before we fight there. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=90.08s)]
*  And that will give them a chance to stay out of harm's way temporarily so that we can focus [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=93.56s)]
*  on fighting and defeating the enemy. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=98.18s)]
*  Hamas is obviously a proxy of Iran. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=102.08s)]
*  The Houthi rebels are said to be even more under Iran's control, and the Houthis launched [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=106.0s)]
*  anti-ship missiles today, several attacks that were shot down generally by U.S. warships. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=112.47999999999999s)]
*  Is Iran getting more involved in the fighting, and what should be the response of the United [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=122.36s)]
*  States? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=127.6s)]
*  First of all, I am happy and relieved that no U.S. servicemen were even injured by this. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=130.4s)]
*  And obviously, according to the press statement, some very fine work done by the sailors of [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=136.32s)]
*  USS Carney in the Red Sea. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=142.44s)]
*  And that's super important that that remains the situation and that no U.S. service members [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=145.76s)]
*  are injured. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=150.88s)]
*  I think it is very worrying to see the escalation, orders coming from Iran, Iranian weapons, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=152.48s)]
*  Iranian tactics and intelligence, and modus operandi, which we can see their fingerprints [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=160.68s)]
*  all over this. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=167.24s)]
*  And what they're doing is jeopardizing and trying to destabilize international global [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=168.92000000000002s)]
*  shipping. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=174.72s)]
*  And that is a significant escalation. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=175.72s)]
*  We see where all this comes from. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=178.56s)]
*  This is another pressure signal from Iran. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=180.52s)]
*  And from our part of the world, what we are seeing is we are taking the intelligence, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=184.4s)]
*  we're assessing the situation, and we are going to respond when we see the conditions [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=191.64000000000001s)]
*  fit. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=196.82s)]
*  And then we will be responding to anybody that has tried to attack Israeli targets, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=198.12s)]
*  or in this case, they weren't even Israeli targets, but are obviously aiming to destabilize [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=203.28s)]
*  the situation and to hurt Israel. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=208.36s)]
*  Yeah, we have just a few seconds left. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  But these were commercial ships. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=212.34s)]
*  These were not warships. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=214.46s)]
*  These were commercial carriers. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=215.9s)]
*  Commercial carriers, not even Israeli flagged and not even Israeli crewed. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=219.58s)]
*  So really a blatant attack of aggression on international shipping. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=223.34s)]
*  This has gone beyond from being an Israel-only issue to really a global issue. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=228.34s)]
*  We will see if there are future responses from the United States and perhaps from the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=235.02s)]
*  rest of the globe, as you say. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=240.78s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Konrikus, thank you. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=242.26s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ZFV0Wsguo&t=246.1s)]
