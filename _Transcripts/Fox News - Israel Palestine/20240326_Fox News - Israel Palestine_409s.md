# Biden admin under fire for not vetoing UN's Gaza cease-fire resolution
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [March 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o)
*  Certain key edits were ignored, including our request to add a condemnation of Hamas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=0.0s)]
*  And we did not agree with everything in the resolution. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  We believe it was important for the counsel to speak out and make clear that our ceasefire [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=12.620000000000001s)]
*  must, any ceasefire, must come with the release of all hostages. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=18.82s)]
*  So this is a major row between Washington and Jerusalem. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=23.2s)]
*  We're going to watch how this goes. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  There was no veto, but Israel was asking the U.S. to go ahead and veto this yesterday. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=27.42s)]
*  The U.S. abstained on the UN Security Council calling for a ceasefire regarding Gaza. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=32.980000000000004s)]
*  This is the first time it failed to protect Israel at the world body since the war began. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=38.260000000000005s)]
*  All this coming now, why Hamas rejects the latest hostage deal on the table and former [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=43.620000000000005s)]
*  Israeli ambassador to the U.S., Ron Dermer, a member of Israel's war cabinet, with me [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=47.86s)]
*  now. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=52.260000000000005s)]
*  And sir, thank you for your time. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=53.260000000000005s)]
*  How deep and how big is... [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=54.260000000000005s)]
*  Good to be with you, Bill. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=55.74s)]
*  What is the disagreement between your government, the people of Israel, and the Biden administration? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=56.9s)]
*  Well, we were obviously disappointed with the decision, as you mentioned, of the United [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=62.7s)]
*  States to not veto this resolution. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=67.82000000000001s)]
*  And the reason why we were disappointed is that for the last five, almost six months [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=70.18s)]
*  now, the U.S. has had a principled position to not delink the issue of a ceasefire from [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=76.18s)]
*  the release of the hostages. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=82.30000000000001s)]
*  And I appreciate the fact that since the resolution was passed, that U.S. officials have come [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=84.48s)]
*  out and say our policy hasn't changed. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=88.48s)]
*  The problem is the resolution doesn't say the same thing. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=90.36s)]
*  What the resolution says is it says there should be a ceasefire. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=94.56s)]
*  And also, you should have the release of hostages. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=98.8s)]
*  There's just no linkage between the two. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  And that linkage was there as late as five days ago, when the U.S. put forward a proposal [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=103.08s)]
*  that was actually vetoed by the Russians and the Chinese, because they want to delink these [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=107.8s)]
*  two things. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=113.08s)]
*  Here's bottom line for your viewers, Bill. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=114.8s)]
*  Iran and Hamas have welcomed this U.N. Security Council decision. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=117.52s)]
*  I guarantee you that any Security Council decision welcomed by Iran and Hamas is not [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=121.48s)]
*  good for the state of Israel and it's not good for the United States of America. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=125.8s)]
*  I want to play a soundbite from over the weekend, Vice President Kamala Harris, on the consequences [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=128.68s)]
*  if indeed the IDF goes into that southern Gazan town called Ra'afah. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=134.36s)]
*  We're looking at about a million and a half people in Ra'afah who are there because they [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=141.08s)]
*  were told to go there, most of them. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=144.0s)]
*  And so we've been very clear that it would be a mistake to move into Ra'afah with any [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=146.84s)]
*  type of military operation. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=152.74s)]
*  Are you ruling out that there would be consequences from the United States? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=154.60000000000002s)]
*  I am ruling out nothing. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=158.20000000000002s)]
*  From that last comment, I'm ruling out nothing. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=159.68s)]
*  That's not normally how the U.S. government talks about Israel. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=162.16000000000003s)]
*  What does that say to you? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  Well, I understand that's the position of the vice president and the U.S. administration [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=169.08s)]
*  when it comes to a major military operation in Ra'afah. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=175.48000000000002s)]
*  But when it comes to consequences, Bill, let me tell you the consequences of us not going [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=178.12s)]
*  into Ra'afah and not getting rid of these four remaining battalions of Hamas. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=182.08s)]
*  Essentially, we have dismantled the terrorist army of Hamas. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=186.68s)]
*  We've got five battalions left. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  Four of them are in Ra'afah. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=191.64000000000001s)]
*  They have somewhere maybe seven, eight thousand terrorists there. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  We cannot afford to not go into Ra'afah and finish the job because then what they'll do [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=196.68s)]
*  is October 7th again and again and again. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=200.72s)]
*  So there's no chance that Israel is not going to go and finish the job in Ra'afah. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=203.84s)]
*  Now, I was supposed to be in the United States today in Washington to discuss the proposals [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=209.12s)]
*  that the U.S. administration has. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=215.16s)]
*  They were going to suggest to us ways where we don't have to do it with a major military [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=217.14000000000001s)]
*  operation. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=220.4s)]
*  Now, I don't see that it's possible to do it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=221.4s)]
*  Of course, we were open to listening to them, but the mistake was that yesterday when they [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=224.28s)]
*  decided not to veto that resolution, they sent a terrible message to Hamas that you [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=227.96s)]
*  can get a ceasefire without giving up the hostages, without making a hostage deal. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=232.2s)]
*  And I think the combination of that message that was sent to the UN Security Council in [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=238.6s)]
*  Israel going to discuss how we're not going to do a major military operation in Ra'afah [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=242.32s)]
*  would have sent the exact wrong message to Hamas. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=247.72s)]
*  That's why the prime minister made the right decision to not send a delegation. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=250.48s)]
*  And I hope we can put the U.S.-Israel relationship back on track because for five months, for [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=254.79999999999998s)]
*  over five months, the U.S. has backed Israel and we're going to win this war. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=260.0s)]
*  And I think it's important to win it with the United States. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=264.96s)]
*  I got it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=268.92s)]
*  President Biden has had your back almost for his entire political career. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=269.92s)]
*  Do you believe he still does today? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=274.56s)]
*  I think in his heart he does, and I appreciate very much when this war started, he came out [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=278.16s)]
*  of the gate with a very clear statement that made a difference between right and wrong, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=284.28000000000003s)]
*  good and evil. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=288.4s)]
*  He called Hamas worse than ISIS. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=289.4s)]
*  He said they were sheer evil. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=291.96s)]
*  And Hamas hasn't changed. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=294.08s)]
*  And you can't leave part of sheer evil in place. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=295.68s)]
*  You got to finish the job. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=298.4s)]
*  And I hope as we move forward to victory that the United States will continue to stand by [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=299.84000000000003s)]
*  our side because, Bill, we have no choice. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=304.56s)]
*  We are not going to allow this army of terrorism, this army of terror, Hamas, to survive in [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=306.76s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=313.08s)]
*  We're going to take them out. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=314.08s)]
*  And we're very close to victory. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=315.12s)]
*  And once we start in Rafah, as the prime minister said, we will be weeks away from finishing [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=316.52s)]
*  the major military operations of this war. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=321.28s)]
*  And remind you, I don't know if you and Dana have covered it now, we are now operating [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=323.98s)]
*  in the northern part of Gaza in Shefa Hospital. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=328.52s)]
*  And that's after we did major military operations, where we did armored divisions that went there [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=331.12s)]
*  and we gave warnings ahead of time. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=335.76000000000005s)]
*  When we went back there just a few days ago, we went with a commando force. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=337.76000000000005s)]
*  And you know what happened with that force? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=342.12s)]
*  We have killed 170 terrorists. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=343.84000000000003s)]
*  We have captured over 800 terrorists. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=347.28000000000003s)]
*  We have not had a single civilian casualty. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=351.12s)]
*  And unfortunately, we lost two Israeli soldiers in that operation. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=353.56s)]
*  That shows you the precision that Israel takes. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=357.86s)]
*  But that can only happen after you finish the major military operations, after you've [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=360.48s)]
*  dismantled the battalions in the north. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=364.96s)]
*  Then you can go in with a smaller operation. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=367.32s)]
*  That's why we have to finish Rafah. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=369.52s)]
*  Once we finish Rafah, the heavy phase of this war will be behind us and the terror army [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=371.64s)]
*  of Hamas will be dismantled. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=376.88s)]
*  And then we can start talking about what happens the day after. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=378.76s)]
*  How do we get to a different future for Israelis and Palestinians alike? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=381.91999999999996s)]
*  There are many, many, many, many questions that remain, sir. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=384.76s)]
*  Thank you for your time. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=387.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=388.0s)]
*  I'm out of time right now. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=389.0s)]
*  But Mr. Ambassador Ron Dermer, thank you. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=390.0s)]
*  Live in Jerusalem. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=391.79999999999995s)]
*  See you when that trip is rescheduled to Washington. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=392.8s)]
*  Because right now there is nothing on the books. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=394.84000000000003s)]
*  Thank you sir for coming on today. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bjXlD_nw-o&t=397.12s)]
