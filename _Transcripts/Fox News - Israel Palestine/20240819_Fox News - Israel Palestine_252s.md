# Jack Keane: This is what Hamas really wants
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [August 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI)
*  Middle East now they're trying to figure this out high stakes diplomacy now Anthony Blinken meeting with top Israeli officials [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=0.0s)]
*  In a push to try and finalize some sort of ceasefire and hostage deal. It's being called maybe the last chance [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=6.48s)]
*  Retired four-star general Jack Keene Fox News senior strategic analyst and sir great to have you on today [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  We've been trying to follow this throughout the week and here's my question [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=19.16s)]
*  Is there a deal to be had or is this simply a delay for this week? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=22.2s)]
*  Well, it's certainly always a potential for a deal when negotiations are taking place the United States really has led these negotiations with [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=26.68s)]
*  Egypt Israel and and cutter [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=34.44s)]
*  Hamas did not participate in the negotiations though [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=37.6s)]
*  They were talking through a third party and what has happened over the weekend as it has happened for the last many months [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=40.56s)]
*  Bill Hamas has rejected the deal. They are opposed to the Israelis occupying [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  What's referred to as the Philadelphia corridor is the border between Gaza and [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=53.24s)]
*  Egypt where they discovered all of these smuggling tunnels that go from the Sinai desert into Gaza move weapons and ammunition [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=57.2s)]
*  And the Israelis certainly are not going to give that up given they have discovered that in the last few months second [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=65.04s)]
*  The Rafa gate is the gate between Gaza and Egypt [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=71.8s)]
*  Egyptians maintain their side [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=76.6s)]
*  Hamas used to maintain the Gaza side what the Israelis want let the Palestinian Authority not Hamas [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=78.6s)]
*  Run that gate, but they want to supervise it Hamas rejects that the Israelis also want to draw a line [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=84.55999999999999s)]
*  Between north and south that goes from east to west [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=91.32s)]
*  Across Gaza so they can conduct security checks of Gazans moving north in particular also to the south [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=95.32s)]
*  Hamas rejects that once no part of it what Hamas really wants bill they want the Israelis out of Gaza [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=103.0s)]
*  Entirely yep, and they also want to see in the deal a permanent ceasefire [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=110.28s)]
*  I think these are intractable things for Israel [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=114.76s)]
*  I think a deal is is unlikely moving forward despite the optimism that the administration has well [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=118.36s)]
*  My feeling was they want to push this thing past the convention [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=124.76s)]
*  That's just the gut sense that I had a week ago [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=127.96s)]
*  I feel I still feel that way today here is the vice president and the sitting president on Sunday general on this topic [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=130.68s)]
*  I [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=134.72s)]
*  Will not speak for him, but I will speak for the president [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=155.0s)]
*  I will tell you that these conversations are ongoing and we are not giving up and we are going to continue to work very hard on this [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=157.24s)]
*  We got to get a ceasefire and we got to get those hostages out. So Netanyahu is saying this general [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=165.04000000000002s)]
*  There are areas where we can show flexibility [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=171.28s)]
*  There are areas where we cannot show flexibility and we are standing firm on them [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=173.68s)]
*  One of the major demands from Hamas as you point out is get the IDF out of Gaza. That's not gonna happen. Is it? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  No, I don't see how Netanyahu could do that at all [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=188.12s)]
*  I mean right now so our audience understands there's thousands of Gazan fighters [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=191.52s)]
*  That still have the capability to form effective organizations [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  a lot of the a lot of them belong to units that were partially destroyed, but [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=200.62s)]
*  Hamas is capable of regrouping and rearming these organizations and [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=205.28s)]
*  The IDF wants to stay on top of that if they walked out of Gaza and left these thousands of fighters there with their principles [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=210.16000000000003s)]
*  Unable leaders still alive. I think we all know what's gonna happen [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=217.24s)]
*  They will declare victory [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=220.28s)]
*  Rearm regroup and then reattack at a time of their convenience [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=222.48000000000002s)]
*  That's that is a prospect that I don't know how Netanyahu and his war cabinet and the people could possibly accept [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3lohZlHSkI&t=226.64000000000001s)]
