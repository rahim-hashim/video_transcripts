# IDF launches raid where Hamas began Oct. 7 massacre
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI)
*  Mollye, let's bring in Richard Goldberg. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=0.0s)]
*  He's a senior advisor at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a former National [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=2.12s)]
*  Security Council official. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=6.16s)]
*  Richard, good morning. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=9.56s)]
*  OK, so the Israeli army further advancing into Gaza. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=10.56s)]
*  We also have some widespread airstrikes into Lebanon. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=14.84s)]
*  What is your assessment of the war at this stage? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=18.32s)]
*  Well, in Gaza, Israel has advanced quite well. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=21.64s)]
*  In northern Gaza, they're signaling that the days of Hamas in northern Gaza are numbered. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=25.32s)]
*  We're seeing Israeli control of Gaza City in most parts, some of the neighborhoods and [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=30.0s)]
*  cities north of Gaza City. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=34.64s)]
*  So that part of the campaign is going well. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=36.44s)]
*  The south is where a lot of the work remains, weeks probably on end, to clear out Hamas [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=38.900000000000006s)]
*  from some of the larger cities. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=44.800000000000004s)]
*  We think of Hanunis, the second largest city in Gaza, where we believe the Hamas leader [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=47.32s)]
*  is hiding, where many hostages may be hiding. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=51.58s)]
*  Israel is finding intense urban warfare there. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=54.6s)]
*  They're also discovering an intense tunnel infrastructure much larger than previously [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=57.52s)]
*  assessed in the south. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=62.24s)]
*  I'd like to put President Biden's statement on the death of two American hostages, Judy [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=63.92s)]
*  and Gud Hagai, on the screen. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  He says, I will never forget what their daughter and the family members of other Americans [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=71.60000000000001s)]
*  held hostage in Gaza have shared with me. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  They've been living through hell for weeks. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=77.84s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu met with the representatives of 28 hostage families. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=80.16s)]
*  How big of a headache is the hostage issue for him at this stage? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=84.52s)]
*  Well, I think it's important for all Americans to remember this is one of the largest terror [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=89.19999999999999s)]
*  attacks on American citizens, not just on Israel. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=94.19999999999999s)]
*  The death toll is now increasing as we start having confirmations of hostages being dead, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=97.19999999999999s)]
*  now at least 34, I believe. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=102.52s)]
*  And so while we think about six to eight hostages remaining in Gaza, we also need to say, where [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=104.67999999999999s)]
*  is the president to put pressure on Qatar to actually deliver these hostages? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=111.08000000000001s)]
*  Qatar is a U.S. ally, supposedly, hosts a major base. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=116.0s)]
*  We don't see any statements from the White House saying we want Doha to secure their [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  release, that we will actually penalize the Qataris, downgrade our relations if we don't [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  see American citizens released. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=128.44s)]
*  That's a key missing piece. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  Yes, Netanyahu is definitely under domestic pressure, but there is widespread political [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=131.64000000000001s)]
*  support for this campaign to continue. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=135.8s)]
*  Let's play some sound from an IDF spokesperson on the headache that is Iran. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=138.28s)]
*  Our perspective is one that Iran is a problem not only for Israel, but a worldwide problem. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=144.08s)]
*  We see the nature of how Hamas conducted their attacks. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=152.64s)]
*  We can't let that be the new norm of terrorism, can we? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  Richard, what needs to be done about Iran? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=161.0s)]
*  Well, it's unconscionable right now that there's $10 billion being made available to the regime [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=163.48s)]
*  by the Biden administration. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=168.4s)]
*  They issued a waiver after October 7th to make that money available. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=169.4s)]
*  That should be locked down. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=173.48000000000002s)]
*  There's a bill in the Senate waiting for the Senate to take that up. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  The House already passed it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=177.28s)]
*  That should happen. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  We should be cracking down on their oil sales and transports to China. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=179.52s)]
*  We should be snapping back the U.N. sanctions as well. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=183.06s)]
*  But we also have to have a military deterrence, in effect. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=185.32000000000002s)]
*  That applies to Yemen. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=189.18s)]
*  We have not seen a military response against the Houthis. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=190.78s)]
*  And we need to be supporting Israel against Hezbollah in the north. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=193.54000000000002s)]
*  If Hezbollah is 10 times larger and more lethal than Hamas, that has to be a threat [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=196.52s)]
*  that's dealt with sooner or later. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=201.96s)]
*  Israel is not going to allow that threat to remain on its border. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=204.12s)]
*  Rich Goldberg, thank you for your time and your analysis today. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=206.88s)]
*  Thanks, Mike. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwxZaCNQrI&t=209.72s)]
