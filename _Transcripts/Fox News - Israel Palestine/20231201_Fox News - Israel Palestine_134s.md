# Biden urges Israel PM against similar Gaza attack post-ceasefire
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3F2dkBJxs)
*  I want to go to Peter Ducey right now at the White House. Of course, you've heard that Secretary of State [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3F2dkBJxs&t=0.0s)]
*  Anthony Blinken is in the region meeting with top officials on both sides. No word on what is coming [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3F2dkBJxs&t=3.36s)]
*  of those discussions. Peter, what can you tell us? We can tell you that officials here are confirming [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3F2dkBJxs&t=8.4s)]
*  details of a report that came out late last night that President Biden over the weekend phoned [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3F2dkBJxs&t=13.52s)]
*  Bibi Netanyahu imploring him not to repeat a military operation in Gaza's south that looks [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3F2dkBJxs&t=18.48s)]
*  like what we just saw in Gaza's north whenever it is the fighting resumes. We have been very [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3F2dkBJxs&t=26.32s)]
*  consistent and clear with our Israeli counterparts that we do not support a move to the south unless [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3F2dkBJxs&t=34.08s)]
*  or until they have adequately accounted for the protection of innocent human life. Netanyahu told [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3F2dkBJxs&t=41.76s)]
*  Biden, according to Axios, he's still going to go into Gaza's south because that's where Hamas is now. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3F2dkBJxs&t=49.68s)]
*  The soft pressure from DC on Tel Aviv is coming today from America's top diplomat Tony Blinken [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3F2dkBJxs&t=56.0s)]
*  in Tel Aviv urging Israel not to sink to Hamas's level. As I've also said since I first came here [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3F2dkBJxs&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  after October 7th, the way Israel defends itself matters. It's imperative that Israel act in [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3F2dkBJxs&t=70.0s)]
*  accordance with international humanitarian law and the laws of war even when confronting a terrorist [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3F2dkBJxs&t=77.44s)]
*  group that respects neither. And as we watch the current Secretary of State overseas trying to [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3F2dkBJxs&t=83.12s)]
*  advance the U.S. president's diplomatic interests, it's just worth pointing out that President Biden [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3F2dkBJxs&t=89.36s)]
*  still has nothing to say about the former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's passing late last night. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3F2dkBJxs&t=95.12s)]
*  Nothing on Twitter or X, no emailed statements, nothing on camera at an event that he had just [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3F2dkBJxs&t=100.08000000000001s)]
*  now. We know that President Biden respects Kissinger's service because he told donors at [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3F2dkBJxs&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  a fundraiser a few weeks ago that he thought that he knew as much about foreign policy as anybody, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3F2dkBJxs&t=110.08s)]
*  including Kissinger, but so far nothing and that is very unusual for something like this. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3F2dkBJxs&t=114.72s)]
*  Peter Ducey, the White House, thank you very much Peter. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3F2dkBJxs&t=121.03999999999999s)]
