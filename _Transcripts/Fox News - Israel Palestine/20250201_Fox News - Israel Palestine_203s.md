# Hamas frees US hostage Keith Siegel, Israel releases 183 Palestinian prisoners
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [February 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6PKKqoJW1E)
*  Yeah, hey guys, good morning. Another hostage release taking place today with three more people coming home. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6PKKqoJW1E&t=0.0s)]
*  American citizen Keith Siegel was released by himself from the port of Gaza in Gaza City. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6PKKqoJW1E&t=5.0s)]
*  We do know Keith was taken with his wife Aviva from the community of Kafar Aza. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6PKKqoJW1E&t=12.0s)]
*  She was released during the first ceasefire. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6PKKqoJW1E&t=17.0s)]
*  Ofer Calderon was also freed from southern Gaza in the city of Hanunis along with Yarden Bebus. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6PKKqoJW1E&t=19.0s)]
*  Yarden, his wife and two young children were kidnapped on the 7th and haven't been seen since. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6PKKqoJW1E&t=25.0s)]
*  You'll notice the scenes were far less chaotic today. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6PKKqoJW1E&t=30.0s)]
*  Israel had threatened Hamas with pausing the release of Palestinian prisoners if the hostages were paraded through a crowd again. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6PKKqoJW1E&t=32.0s)]
*  We do know this exchange is taking place later today for more than 100 Palestinian prisoners. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6PKKqoJW1E&t=39.0s)]
*  30 of them will be freed into the West Bank. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6PKKqoJW1E&t=45.0s)]
*  The majority, though, going back into Gaza, an indication that many of them have life sentences [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6PKKqoJW1E&t=48.0s)]
*  and again will be freed from Israeli prisons. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6PKKqoJW1E&t=53.0s)]
*  When you see the images, though, today along the Gaza border of these families reuniting, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6PKKqoJW1E&t=56.0s)]
*  you just think about Yarden Bebus, this man who was dragged into Gaza and his two young children and wife who remained there. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6PKKqoJW1E&t=61.0s)]
*  This is really a focal point for the Israelis as they are demanding that all the hostages be released. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6PKKqoJW1E&t=68.0s)]
*  Guys? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6PKKqoJW1E&t=74.0s)]
*  Thank you, Trey. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6PKKqoJW1E&t=75.0s)]
*  Thanks, Trey. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6PKKqoJW1E&t=76.0s)]
*  Well, you guys, Keith's wife was also held hostage for 51 days. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6PKKqoJW1E&t=77.0s)]
*  If you guys recall, she spoke to Fox and Friends back in December. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6PKKqoJW1E&t=82.0s)]
*  Let's take a flashback and look at what she had to say. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6PKKqoJW1E&t=86.0s)]
*  Her name is Aviva. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6PKKqoJW1E&t=88.0s)]
*  Keith is the most sweetest, loving person on Earth. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6PKKqoJW1E&t=90.0s)]
*  He's very proud to be American and he's waiting to get out of Gaza. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6PKKqoJW1E&t=94.0s)]
*  He's there suffering underneath the ground in the worst conditions than anybody could ever handle. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6PKKqoJW1E&t=101.0s)]
*  And Keith is so sensitive. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6PKKqoJW1E&t=109.0s)]
*  He's just waiting and keeping alive to come back to his family and his grandchildren that love him so much and can't wait for him to come back. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6PKKqoJW1E&t=111.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, we sit here this morning, I think, with a renewed appreciation for reuniting with our families [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6PKKqoJW1E&t=120.0s)]
*  with the news of the last couple of days and the idea that there are people at DCA [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6PKKqoJW1E&t=126.0s)]
*  and now there are people in Mexico who are just standing there waiting on their family back that won't happen. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6PKKqoJW1E&t=131.0s)]
*  And to know that there are at least, I guess, some good news this morning in the sense that a family will be reunited, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6PKKqoJW1E&t=137.0s)]
*  a handful of families will be reunited. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6PKKqoJW1E&t=144.0s)]
*  I think we have to keep our compass pointed a little bit at something positive on a morning like this morning. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6PKKqoJW1E&t=146.0s)]
*  And as tragic as these hostages being taken that day was to have somebody go home to his wife, they needed that news this morning. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6PKKqoJW1E&t=151.0s)]
*  Absolutely. And by the way, I mean, he's holding up. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6PKKqoJW1E&t=160.0s)]
*  I mean, God knows what he's been through, but he's holding up, as you can see from right there. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6PKKqoJW1E&t=164.0s)]
*  And he looks like he's just so anxious to get back to those grandkids. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6PKKqoJW1E&t=168.0s)]
*  And a reminder that in this ceasefire, what we're seeing is an exchange of actual prisoners in Israel being released [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6PKKqoJW1E&t=172.0s)]
*  in exchange for grandmas and granddads who were innocent citizen civilians that were captured by a terrorist organization. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6PKKqoJW1E&t=183.0s)]
