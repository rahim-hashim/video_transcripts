*  Highway six, a highway that [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=52.12s)]

*  central Israel, and you [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  mentioned this happens as [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=56.120000000000005s)]
*  well. We're talking about that. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=58.18s)]

*  So you see Israeli soldiers [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=69.17999999999999s)]
*  just before carrying out the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=74.17999999999999s)]
*  offensive overnight. They've [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=75.17999999999999s)]
*  been preparing for this for [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=76.17999999999999s)]
*  months. Their goal is to [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=77.17999999999999s)]
*  neutralize Hezbollah threats on [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=79.17999999999999s)]
*  the border so the 60,000 [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=81.17999999999999s)]
*  evacuated Israelis in the north [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=82.18s)]
*  can return to their homes. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=84.18s)]
*  Another part of Israel's plan [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=86.18s)]
*  is to hamper Hezbollah's [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=87.24000000000001s)]
*  weapons capabilities. They hit [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  several facilities in the Dahiya [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  neighborhood of Beirut overnight, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  and if that sounds familiar, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  here's why. That's the same [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  neighborhood where Israel took [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  out former Hezbollah leader [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  Hassan Nasrallah last Friday, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  and Israeli security officials [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  said this morning that targeting [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  Hezbollah leadership continues [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  to be a focus for the IDF as [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  this limited ground offensive [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  begins. Now, a senior U.S. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  official told Fox that this [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  limited ground offensive is [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  expected to be shorter than [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  the second Lebanon war in 2006. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=116.3s)]
*  That lasted 34 days, and it [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=118.3s)]
*  ended with a U.N. resolution [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=120.3s)]
*  requiring that Hezbollah [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=122.3s)]
*  operate north of the Latani [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=123.3s)]
*  River, which is something that [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=125.3s)]
*  didn't end up being enforced, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=127.3s)]
*  which is why the Israelis in [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=128.29999999999998s)]
*  the north had to evacuate from [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=130.29999999999998s)]
*  their homes. The IDF, a senior [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=132.29999999999998s)]
*  Israeli official, told us this [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=134.29999999999998s)]
*  morning that right now they [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=136.29999999999998s)]
*  will not say if the Latani [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=138.29999999999998s)]
*  River is the marker that they [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=139.29999999999998s)]
*  will need to move Hezbollah [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=141.3s)]
*  terrorists north of the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=143.3s)]
*  border. The IDF is not going [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=144.36s)]
*  to allow the Israeli government [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=145.36s)]
*  to do that. They're going to [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=147.36s)]
*  have to wait until the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=148.36s)]
*  Israeli government is ready to [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=149.4s)]

*  you think the Israeli government [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=174.42000000000002s)]

*  in the next few years. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=233.54s)]
*  It's going to be a very [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=234.54s)]
*  difficult time for the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=235.54s)]
*  Israeli government to return. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=236.54s)]
*  There's 60,000 citizens who had [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=238.54s)]
*  to evacuate and restore the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=240.54s)]

*  region. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=245.54s)]
*  Beyond that, I think, again, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=246.54s)]
*  it's for Lebanon to take [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=247.54s)]
*  control of their own border and [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=248.54s)]
*  not allow Hezbollah to homestead [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=250.54s)]
*  and threaten Israel. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=252.54s)]
*  Yeah, allow those 60,000 to [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=253.54s)]
*  return. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=255.54s)]

*  make sure that their homes are [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=258.53999999999996s)]

*  in the Middle East, they're [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=260.6s)]
*  going to have to do that. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=261.6s)]
*  And I think that's going to [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=262.6s)]
*  be a very difficult time for [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=263.6s)]
*  Iran to retaliate as a result [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=264.6s)]
*  of all of this. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=266.6s)]
*  Do you think that will happen? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=268.6s)]
*  And if so, how? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=269.6s)]
*  Well, it's awfully hard to [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=272.6s)]
*  predict exactly how Iran might [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=273.6s)]
*  respond. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=275.6s)]
*  We know that Iran hasn't [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=276.6s)]
*  responded thus far. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=277.6s)]
*  And U. S. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=279.6s)]
*  The U. S. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=280.6s)]
*  Has deployed additional air [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=281.6s)]
*  assets into the Middle East in [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=282.6s)]

*  responding. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=286.6s)]
*  Look, the Iranians, their [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=287.6s)]
*  strategy has been to use their [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=288.6s)]
*  air assets to deter Iran from [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=289.66s)]
*  responding. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=290.66s)]
*  They don't want to be involved [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=291.66s)]
*  in a conventional war that they [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=292.66s)]
*  know they would lose against [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=293.66s)]
*  Israel or with the assistance [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=294.66s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=295.66s)]
*  So with the United States [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=296.66s)]
*  intelligence community, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=297.66s)]
*  Israel's intelligence [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=298.66s)]
*  community has to be on high [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=299.66s)]
*  alert for any response from [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=300.66s)]
*  Iran. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=301.66s)]
*  And remember that they've got [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=302.66s)]
*  the asymmetric capability not [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=303.66s)]
*  only to launch cyber attacks [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=304.66s)]
*  against us, they did that [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=305.66s)]
*  against the Trump campaign, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=306.66s)]
*  but they've got active [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=307.66s)]
*  assassination plots out [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=308.66s)]
*  against former President Trump [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=309.66s)]
*  and his senior cabinet [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=310.66s)]
*  officials. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=311.66s)]
*  Yeah, and one of the things [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=312.66s)]
*  that's going to happen is [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=313.66s)]
*  that the U. S. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=314.66s)]
*  Has deployed additional air [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=315.66s)]
*  assets into the Middle East [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=316.66s)]
*  in an effort to deter Iran [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=317.66s)]
*  from responding. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=318.72s)]
*  And so that's a big thing [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=319.72s)]
*  for the U. S. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=320.72s)]
*  Has, of course, has been [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=321.72s)]
*  very, very important to [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=322.72s)]
*  the US military officials. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=323.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=324.72s)]
*  And when it comes to [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=325.72s)]
*  President Biden's response, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=326.72s)]
*  he was, of course, asked [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=327.72s)]
*  about this yesterday and he [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=328.72s)]
*  is continuing to call for [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=329.72s)]
*  a ceasefire. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=330.72s)]
*  And with that in mind, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=331.72s)]
*  I want to read something [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=332.72s)]
*  that Jared Kushner posted [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=333.72s)]

*  This is just a portion [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=335.72s)]
*  of a lengthy post about [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=336.72s)]
*  the importance of this [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=337.72s)]
*  moment when it comes to both [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=338.72s)]
*  Israel and the United States. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=339.72s)]
*  He says that more than 40 [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=340.72s)]
*  years ago, Hezbollah killed [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=341.72s)]

*  we should be thanking [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=361.78000000000003s)]

*  damage on Hezbollah. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=376.84s)]
*  The last thing that [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQjsnx0iKRo&t=377.84s)]
