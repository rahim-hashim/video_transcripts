# Kilmeade: We can't make sense of senseless violence
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ)
*  First, we will begin here, the growing volatility in the Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=0.0s)]
*  We have been watching Israel on the defensive since Hamas started this heinous war on October [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=3.36s)]
*  7. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=8.72s)]
*  And, somehow, they have lost the PR war to this point. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=9.72s)]
*  We have seen the IDF moving through Gaza, making great progress militarily, but struggling [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=12.84s)]
*  to justify non-traditional military targets, like a hospital. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=17.64s)]
*  They assumed the world knew the tactics of the immoral, ruthless terrorist group, and [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=22.12s)]
*  would understand what Hamas was all about. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=26.36s)]
*  But that changed this week. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=29.36s)]
*  They stopped waiting in Israel. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=30.36s)]
*  The Israelis finally realized they had to do something about it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=32.0s)]
*  They told us about the butchery on October 7. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  Now, if you want, you can see it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=37.56s)]
*  They're bringing reporters into the fold to view it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=40.36s)]
*  I had an offer to go on Monday to see it, although I didn't need proof. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=42.68s)]
*  They're going to release footage of the tunnels as well as the weapons, too. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=47.2s)]
*  AK-47s, we're talking about grenades, we're talking about battle vests, all with Hamas [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=51.16s)]
*  insignias on them. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  We're sitting in an MRI wing of Gaza's largest hospital. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=57.2s)]
*  Not really the place you keep weapons, would you? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  More proof that Hamas has no issue putting civilians in harm's way. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=63.28s)]
*  In fact, you could say it is their mission to do so, burning, slaughtering, beheading [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=66.68s)]
*  innocent people and children, up to 800 in one day alone. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=71.76s)]
*  We can't make sense of the senseless violence, but here to try is two men that have covered [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=75.7s)]
*  these wars and are doing it for us, spent a lot of time inside the Middle East region, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=80.80000000000001s)]
*  and have both witnessed firsthand what goes through the mind of a terrorist. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=84.8s)]
*  Trey Yanks has been on the ground since the start of this war and has been in contact [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=88.64s)]
*  with members of Hamas in the past. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=92.08s)]
*  And Benjamin Hall has been covering Middle East conflicts since 2006, wrote a book about [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=94.48s)]
*  the brutal ways of ISIS, and erotically covered the Ukraine War. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=98.52000000000001s)]
*  First things first, welcome to both of you guys. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=102.44s)]
*  Ben, to you. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=105.56s)]
*  Were you surprised that Israel didn't realize the PR headwinds against them even after October [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=107.12s)]
*  7th and had to tell more of their military story? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=114.44s)]
*  No, look, I think that they've been well aware of it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=117.88s)]
*  I think they knew that the PR war was on their side in the first few days, but they knew [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=121.6s)]
*  that as soon as they moved into Gaza, as soon as the bombing started, that that would start [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=125.08s)]
*  to fade. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=129.28s)]
*  And that's what we've seen since this started. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=130.28s)]
*  And now they need to push back. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=131.72s)]
*  They need to keep reminding people of the hostages in the tunnels. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=133.56s)]
*  They need to keep reminding people that Hamas uses human shields, because if not, all you [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=136.6s)]
*  see are these images from inside Gaza. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=141.36s)]
*  And they are terrible. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=143.24s)]
*  And there are civilians dying. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=144.24s)]
*  And so what we are starting to see are people starting to move towards the Palestinian side, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=145.60000000000002s)]
*  start to call for more of a ceasefire. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=149.68s)]
*  And that happens not only in the media that we're seeing, we're also starting to see it [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=151.60000000000002s)]
*  in governments as well. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=154.84s)]
*  So even the State Department, the White House, moving towards that position. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=155.84s)]
*  And that's the difficulty for Israel right now. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=159.46s)]
*  How do they keep people reminded that there are people they have to save, that Israel [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=161.72s)]
*  itself is at threat, and without going in, they can never stop this, that they have to [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=165.96s)]
*  go after Hamas? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=170.88s)]
*  It's very, very difficult from them. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=171.92s)]
*  And they are keeping on top of the journalists as much as they can. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=173.5s)]
*  So they are constantly updated. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=176.72s)]
*  Trey, I've been watching, and you've been kind enough to be contributing nonstop through [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=178.51999999999998s)]
*  Fox Infrared throughout the day, and I'm watching explosions. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=184.68s)]
*  And then the invasion started. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=187.62s)]
*  And now for the first time, I think they seem to be telling you guys, you can go with the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=189.34s)]
*  IDF on the ground. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=193.68s)]
*  And now they want you to tape these things. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=195.4s)]
*  They're not limiting you into what you can show. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=197.24s)]
*  I would imagine, what are you seeing and what does the IDF want to get across when you travel [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=199.44s)]
*  with them into the war zone? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=205.44s)]
*  Yeah, Brian, well, they have no editorial control over what we put out. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=209.52s)]
*  We only agree to blur faces of certain soldiers and sensitive technology that could endanger [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  their troops. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=219.0s)]
*  But editorially, we have full control when we embed with Israeli forces. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=220.0s)]
*  Benjamin raises a great point, though, because he talks about the terrible images coming [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=223.76s)]
*  out of Gaza. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=227.6s)]
*  This is a major problem for Israel as they try to maintain international support. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=228.6s)]
*  We know as a fact, thousands of civilians are dying in the Israeli campaign against [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=233.56s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=237.6s)]
*  The Israelis say they're not going to stop until they bring the hostages home and until [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=238.6s)]
*  they destroy Hamas. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=242.26s)]
*  But this is not a process that will take days or a process that will take weeks, but rather [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=244.35999999999999s)]
*  months and even possibly years as they work to hunt down the leadership responsible for [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=248.32s)]
*  ordering the October 7 attacks. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=253.94s)]
*  Now, less than 24 hours after the Israelis entered Gaza's largest hospital, the Al-Shifa [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=256.5s)]
*  Hospital, we joined those forces in Gaza City. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=261.06s)]
*  And we got a firsthand look in the dark of night at just how difficult this battlefield [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=264.7s)]
*  is. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=269.22s)]
*  It is an urban battle environment. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=270.22s)]
*  They are operating from inside Gaza City with threats from Hamas less than a block away [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=271.6s)]
*  as they try to push forward and search for information. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=276.38s)]
*  But they are faced with this critical information battle, and it is one that so far they say [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=280.02s)]
*  is a trickle effect. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=285.08s)]
*  They say what they've found so far at Gaza's Shifa Hospital is the tip of the iceberg. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=286.52s)]
*  When we were there, we saw weapons in an MRI room. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=291.2s)]
*  They released video of a single tunnel entrance on the hospital complex. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=293.78s)]
*  They say there is more information to come out when they discover it. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=298.06s)]
*  We have to be patient on our reporting, hold them accountable for what they say, and wait [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=301.76s)]
*  until we get that actual information. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=305.71999999999997s)]
*  Brian? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=307.84s)]
*  Ben? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=308.84s)]
*  Yeah, Ben, you're located right now in the UK, and there's been demonstrations more for [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=309.84s)]
*  the Palestinian cause than for the Israeli cause. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=314.91999999999996s)]
*  I've been stunned by what I'm seeing. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=318.08s)]
*  You were just also in New York, and you probably were reading and saw a lot of things that [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=320.0s)]
*  were pro-Palestinian over Israel. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=324.23999999999995s)]
*  Does that resonate in the Middle East? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=327.21999999999997s)]
*  Do you think they know what it's like here, and does that matter there? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=328.88s)]
*  Well, I think absolutely that the message is being pushed out around the world, and [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=333.03999999999996s)]
*  that's what you said earlier. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=337.14s)]
*  This is a PR campaign, and both sides are trying to push out their messaging. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=338.14s)]
*  Yes, you see some of the marches that we've seen here in the UK. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=341.94s)]
*  Three hundred thousand people last weekend marched here, and quite a few of them wearing [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=345.7s)]
*  Hamas headscarves, carrying anti-Semitic signs, verging on Nazism. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=350.54s)]
*  There is very little on the pro-Israeli side, and there is now a big push here on the ground [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=357.04s)]
*  as well to say more people who support Israel need to rise up, need us to talk about it. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=362.20000000000005s)]
*  The other sense is there's a lot of fear amongst Jews and Israelis. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=367.78s)]
*  I've spoken to lots here who do not want to go out being open that they are Jewish because [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=372.34s)]
*  of the anti-Semitism. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=377.53999999999996s)]
*  That part of the PR campaign is very much being won, I would say, on the Palestinian [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=379.53999999999996s)]
*  side. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=384.05999999999995s)]
*  I will say that in Paris last weekend you did have a very big pro-Israel march. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=385.05999999999995s)]
*  In D.C. on, I think, Tuesday, you had a very big one as well. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=388.46s)]
*  We are starting to see a shift in that direction as well. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=391.53999999999996s)]
*  This is part of the back and forth that we're seeing at the moment, and it is going on around [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=394.7s)]
*  the world. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=398.5s)]
*  Trey, what does this region need? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=399.5s)]
*  What would be the right message to send to these forces back by Iran to show that we [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=403.97999999999996s)]
*  got Israel's back and we're not going to be a victim? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=410.84s)]
*  Well, look, when you talk with top Israeli defense officials, including the defense minister [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=414.7s)]
*  and I've spoken with him multiple times in person since this war began, they explain [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=422.34s)]
*  why American forces are in the region, why you have these warships here. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=427.42s)]
*  And it is not to battle Hamas. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=431.3s)]
*  It is a message of deterrence to Iranian proxies across the region, namely the Lebanese militant [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=433.82s)]
*  group Hezbollah that has an arsenal of hundreds of thousands of rockets and missiles, not [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=439.06s)]
*  to get involved because there could be an American response. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=443.82s)]
*  But when we talk about the attacks on U.S. bases, we've talked with analysts and people [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=447.18s)]
*  who are watching this closely who have raised questions about the response and if the level [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=450.86s)]
*  of deterrence is high enough because the attacks continue. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=455.58000000000004s)]
*  And when we look back in history, and I remember it was the year 2020, Benji and I were in [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=458.78000000000003s)]
*  Amman, Jordan, and we were covering the aftermath of the attack on the American embassy in Baghdad. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=464.18s)]
*  And ultimately, the response by the Trump administration at the time was to target Qasem [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=471.74s)]
*  Soleimani with a drone strike. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=477.74s)]
*  And then there was a response from the Iranians, but then there was a period of quiet. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=480.98s)]
*  And so some analysts have pointed to that time period when they are looking about what's [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=484.82s)]
*  happening now. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=488.22s)]
*  There was a time in the Middle East when one or two of these attacks on American bases [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=489.22s)]
*  would lead to a significant U.S. response, often targeting Iranian-backed military proxies [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=493.6s)]
*  in places like Iraq and Syria. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=500.1s)]
*  And Ben, real quick, you think we need to show strength. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=504.90000000000003s)]
*  You told me that last week, right? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=507.3s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=509.46s)]
*  Yeah, look, absolutely. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=510.46s)]
*  This is one of the things that is most infuriating is that Iran is allowed to push the boundaries. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=511.46s)]
*  Over 50 times it has attacked U.S. bases. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=516.34s)]
*  Over 50 American soldiers have been injured. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=518.86s)]
*  But only one soldier was injured, was killed when President Trump ordered the strike on [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=521.54s)]
*  Soleimani. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=526.26s)]
*  And frankly, the attacks on these Shia bases across Iraq does nothing to Iran. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=527.26s)]
*  It is no response at all. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=531.34s)]
*  And there are big questions about whether or not the current administration is pulling [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=532.84s)]
*  back and not doing enough. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=536.54s)]
*  It is not sending a message to Iran. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=537.98s)]
*  And Iran frankly is able to do what it likes at the moment. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=540.64s)]
*  So waiting to see if that changes. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=542.86s)]
*  But I think the feeling is it won't. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=544.26s)]
*  Thanks, guys. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kw122rietQ&t=546.14s)]
