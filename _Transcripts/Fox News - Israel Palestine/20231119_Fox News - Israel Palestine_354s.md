# What's the best strategy for America coming out on top?
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw)
*  Welcome back America. I'm here with former US Air Force Brigadier General, I love the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=0.0s)]
*  sound of Brigadier General, Rob Spalding, also Hudson Institute Senior Fellow, Semper [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Dot, AI CEO and Founder General. I'm very concerned about the state of our national [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  security and military, particularly with this Commander in Chief. I watch what he's doing [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  to the Israelis in the entire Middle East, where he's basically lit a fire over there [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=21.84s)]
*  and he's re-arming the enemy. I watched him meet with Xi. I'm extremely concerned about [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=26.74s)]
*  what they were discussing and how they were discussing it, for obvious reasons. I look [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=33.98s)]
*  at Ukraine and Russia. I'm not one of those Republicans who feel we ought to cut and run [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=39.18s)]
*  with Ukraine, but I am one of those people who thinks that Joe Biden doesn't want them [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=46.22s)]
*  to win. And I am very concerned about what's happening to the Ukrainian citizens and the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=49.62s)]
*  country over there as this grinds on and grinds on and grinds on. He seems to try to want [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=55.02s)]
*  to his re-engineering, he and his poison Ivy League eggheads, re-engineer the world and [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=60.660000000000004s)]
*  so forth. But now my question, I'm worried about our security and I'm worried about our [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=67.58s)]
*  military given what's exploding all over the world. What do you say? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=72.38s)]
*  Well, if you go back to World War II, remember we chose a priority. That priority was Europe. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=76.74000000000001s)]
*  And while Europe was done, Japan had to wait. And the Pacific forces fought a campaign, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=82.82000000000001s)]
*  but they still were not the priority in terms of resources. What we have now is we have [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=90.7s)]
*  this rise of great power, authoritarian competition led by the Chinese Communist Party, supported [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=96.74000000000001s)]
*  by Russia and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. So that was the first shoe to drop for this [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=103.0s)]
*  second Cold War. Then Hamas's invasion of Israel, supported by Iran. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=107.38s)]
*  So we've got a global Cold War going on and we're trying to prioritize everything. Meanwhile, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=112.33999999999999s)]
*  our southern border is open. Everybody knows that. And so I think between great power, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=117.86s)]
*  authoritarianism, competition, conflict, Cold War, whatever you want to call it, the rise [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=123.22s)]
*  of global Islamism, which we're getting the second wave now, and woke ideology in the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=128.54s)]
*  free world. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=134.86s)]
*  We face three threats. And this is something that I began to recognize when I was in the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=136.44000000000003s)]
*  Air Force and it's just gotten worse since I left. And you're right, we have a horrible [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=141.0s)]
*  strategy. We don't have policy that's focused on Americans and national security. And I, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=147.82000000000002s)]
*  quite frankly, have been frustrated by the whole episode. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=154.34s)]
*  I mean, the big battle with the Department of Defense right now and the administration [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=157.10000000000002s)]
*  is over them paying for transportation for abortions. They can't meet their enlistment [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=161.54s)]
*  numbers in an all-volunteer military. That is a disaster. I'm very concerned that we're [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=168.34s)]
*  actually being outgunned now. We have a Navy that's under 300 ships. Under Reagan it was [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=174.26s)]
*  600 ships. They are further advanced on hypersonic missiles than we are. The Chinese are modernizing [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=180.29999999999998s)]
*  excuse me, the Russians are modernizing their nuclear missiles. The Chinese are building [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=187.22s)]
*  them as fast as they possibly can. We're doing none of these things. He's got a 19 percent [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=192.58s)]
*  increase for the EPA budget, a 3 percent for the defense budget, when it ought to be reversed [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=197.66s)]
*  in so many ways. I just feel like we're hollowing out our ability to defend ourselves and psychologically [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=202.42000000000002s)]
*  we don't have a president or administration that is explaining the real dangers that this [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=210.22s)]
*  country faces. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=214.26s)]
*  I think, right, they don't understand that our supply chain starts and ends in China. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=215.73999999999998s)]
*  So if you're going to fight a war with China, for example, where are you going to get all [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=221.17999999999998s)]
*  the parts and pieces to support that war machine? And that's a challenge we face. We have to [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=224.73999999999998s)]
*  go back to Eisenhower's strategy after World War II for the Cold War. And that was really [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=229.14s)]
*  to muster our resources, to build our industrial base, focus on science and technology and [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=235.5s)]
*  manufacturing, building our economic capacity here at home while we basically use nuclear [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=241.18s)]
*  weapons as a deterrent. And we're going to have to pull out the same strategy. We could [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=247.14000000000001s)]
*  not back then, we could not meet the conventional power in Europe of the Soviet Union. We can't [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=250.98000000000002s)]
*  meet it here with China. And so we're going to have to focus on nuclear weapons. And we're [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=256.58s)]
*  going to have to go back to a lot of the same Cold War strategies we had before. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=261.3s)]
*  How about Reagan's strategy for defeating the Soviet Union? It sounds a little bit like [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=265.34000000000003s)]
*  what you're talking about. That is build the strongest kickass economy on the face of the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=269.1s)]
*  earth with the most cutting edge technology possible. Yes, building up our military as [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=273.82s)]
*  well. But it all starts with the economy. That's your point. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=279.98s)]
*  That's correct. And don't forget that Reagan had the benefit of a number of administrations [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=284.66s)]
*  that were pursuing this very limited, you know, conventional military budget, focusing [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=290.78s)]
*  on nuclear weapons and then using most of the money to build our industrial base, our [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=296.02s)]
*  productivity, our ability to then he could turn to that big industrial base and the big [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=301.02s)]
*  science and technology investment that they've made over several decades and say, let's [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=306.7s)]
*  basically end it now. And so what's going on? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=311.06s)]
*  The Chinese have basically learned from that and are basically repeating the same [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=314.53999999999996s)]
*  strategy, except now we're on the other side. So they own the industrial base. They're [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=319.74s)]
*  using our investment against us, our ability to help them in terms of technology, talent and [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=324.74s)]
*  capital. So we have to stop that. We have to bring that back home and we have to gird [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=330.78s)]
*  ourselves. This is going to take a long time. It's not going to be over, you know, in a [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=336.65999999999997s)]
*  couple of years. It's going to be decades. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOV4klnbNLw&t=340.14s)]
