# Ratcliffe rips Biden’s weak warning to Iran: ‘Don’t’ doesn’t mean anything
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM)
*  A stark warning by FBI Director Christopher Wray during a hearing on Capitol Hill on Thursday [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=0.0s)]
*  on the elevated terrorist threat. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=4.78s)]
*  As we continue to monitor this morning, Iran's unprecedented direct attack on Israel and [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=6.74s)]
*  the implications here at home. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=11.66s)]
*  The FBI alert coming as over 10 million people have illegally entered the United States on [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=13.5s)]
*  President Biden's watch. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=17.66s)]
*  And nearly 2 million have evaded apprehension altogether and disappeared into the country [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=19.26s)]
*  with no trace of who they are, where they came from, or what their intentions are. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=23.1s)]
*  During this fiscal year, 75 people on the FBI's terrorist watch list have been encountered [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=27.5s)]
*  at the southern border, with a total of 342 since October of 2021. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=31.22s)]
*  Joining me now with more on the threats Americans face here at home is the former Director of [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=35.36s)]
*  National Intelligence, John Ratcliffe. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=40.3s)]
*  And Director Ratcliffe, it's always a pleasure. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=42.4s)]
*  Thanks very much for being here this morning. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=44.08s)]
*  Good morning, Maria. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=45.64s)]
*  I want to first talk about Iran's direct threat at Israel. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  99% of those attacks intercepted by Israel and U.S. military. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=52.04s)]
*  Your thoughts and reaction? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=58.06s)]
*  I know that you have been on the phone with your former counterparts in Israel. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=59.26s)]
*  What can you tell us? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=63.32s)]
*  Well, Maria, the word people keep using to describe this attack is unprecedented, and [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=64.32s)]
*  it is. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=70.78s)]
*  But that's why it's ironic that we find ourselves in the all too familiar position of talking [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=71.78s)]
*  about a long list of deterrence failures by the Biden administration. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=76.48s)]
*  Of course, the failure to deter Vladimir Putin from invading Ukraine. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=81.84s)]
*  And then after the attack on Israel on October the 7th, the failure of the Biden administration [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=86.66s)]
*  with hollow talking points, a single word, don't. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=92.48s)]
*  And the response to that, as you know, was more than 170 attacks on U.S. forces and the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=97.36s)]
*  deaths of three Americans, dozens of traumatic brain injuries. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=105.4s)]
*  So clearly not working. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=108.84s)]
*  Which is why I was surprised that those very same hollow words and threats from the Biden [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=111.12s)]
*  administration don't were used last week after Israel took out IRGC General Mohammed Zahedi, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=116.36s)]
*  who was the architect of those October 7th attack. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=125.16s)]
*  And again, it didn't work. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=127.72s)]
*  An unprecedented attack, 300 drones, missiles, rockets, including cruise missiles and ballistic [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=129.2s)]
*  missiles. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=136.64000000000001s)]
*  You mentioned the fact that there's been credit given for the good work of the Israelis and [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=139.4s)]
*  the Brits and the Jordanians and the United States in reacting to this and shooting down [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=146.24s)]
*  most of those threats and minimizing the damage. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=151.8s)]
*  But reaction isn't as good as prevention. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=154.28s)]
*  And Donald Trump is right when he said he would have prevented this. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=157.08s)]
*  And the Israelis believe that this would have been prevented. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=160.32s)]
*  They are, I think, understandably surprised and upset, as was I, that the seeds for this [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=165.6s)]
*  failure and deterrence took place in Joe Biden's reaction to that hit in Damascus on Zahedi, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=171.96s)]
*  where instead of just remaining silent, the Biden administration quickly came out and [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=179.32s)]
*  said the U.S. was not involved in this. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=183.16s)]
*  And that sent a message to Iran and to the rest of the world that the U.S. was not with [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=185.95999999999998s)]
*  Israel, that the U.S. was reluctant to support Israel on this. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=190.44s)]
*  And that really shows how much fractured this relationship has become between the United [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=196.52s)]
*  States and Israel moving forward. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=202.52s)]
*  And I think that that emboldened Iran. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=205.04s)]
*  And as one of the former intelligence officials in Iran said to me last night, with friends [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=206.92000000000002s)]
*  like Joe Biden, Israel doesn't need more enemies. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=213.7s)]
*  And so I think that they are upset about this. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=217.54s)]
*  And I think now it's compounded by very quickly the Biden administration has taken the wrong [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=223.0s)]
*  response in the aftermath of this. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=226.24s)]
*  And the response is, instead of criticizing Iran, and Joe Biden hasn't spoken to that, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=228.36s)]
*  they're leaking the fact that they're upset that the Israelis may overreact to this existential [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=233.44s)]
*  threat, that they don't have a strategy, and that they might use this to further escalation. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=238.2s)]
*  And I will tell you, that's infuriating to the Israelis as they face, again, an unprecedented [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=244.0s)]
*  historic attack of this nature. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=250.04s)]
*  And they're not real happy about being criticized and getting advice from the masters of disaster, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=252.4s)]
*  Biden, Blinken, Sullivan, and Austin, the architects of so many foreign policy failures [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=261.4s)]
*  who are now lecturing the Israelis about what to do in this threat. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=269.4s)]
*  Are you expecting a response from Israel to Iran? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=273.06s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=277.72s)]
*  And I think that there should be, there must be. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=279.4s)]
*  Look, Joe Biden doesn't have any red lines, they get crossed, doesn't mean anything, but [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=282.08s)]
*  the Israelis do have red lines. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=287.67999999999995s)]
*  And a kinetic attack by Iran into Israel was a red line that must be answered. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=289.44s)]
*  Maria, the idea of not overreacting, if you don't respond to this forcefully, it normalizes [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=295.79999999999995s)]
*  it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=302.03999999999996s)]
*  It sends the message that these kinds of attacks are okay. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=303.03999999999996s)]
*  So unfortunately, instead of working with Israel, I think Israel will act alone here [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=305.28s)]
*  and they will consider and should consider a strong response that could target anything [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=311.64s)]
*  from Iranian oil infrastructure, Iranian military installations, Iranian leadership, or perhaps [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=316.35999999999996s)]
*  Iran's nuclear facilities and nuclear program. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=324.0s)]
*  I think all of this highlights what a failure the Biden and before that the Obama administration [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=327.71999999999997s)]
*  approaches to Iran really is. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=333.68s)]
*  And these are the people that have been enriching Iran and encouraging them and allowing them [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=336.52s)]
*  to maintain a nuclear program. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=342.15999999999997s)]
*  This is a country that does not deserve to have nuclear ambitions. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=344.0s)]
*  And I think the Israelis will look seriously at removing this existential threat in that [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=347.32s)]
*  way. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=351.84s)]
*  So you think that the Israelis believe that the Biden administration and its policies [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=352.84s)]
*  empowered Iran to attack Israel? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=357.47999999999996s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=360.88s)]
*  I mean, billions and billions of dollars from the Biden administration in ransom for hostages [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=363.04s)]
*  and in sanctions relief rebuilt the Iranian economy. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=370.56s)]
*  The irony, Maria, is so many of those rockets and missiles that were shot down yesterday [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=375.44s)]
*  were paid for by the Biden administration. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=380.76s)]
*  Those were money that the U.S. sent under the Biden administration was used to rebuild [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=382.76s)]
*  the Iranian military structure to use against Israel. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=391.84000000000003s)]
*  And Israel very clearly sees that and resents it. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=395.56s)]
*  Real quick before you go, John, your reaction to the House reauthorizing FISA. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=400.16s)]
*  Obviously, you lived this during the Russia collusion lie when the FBI spied on President [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=406.16s)]
*  Trump's officials and campaign illegally. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=411.92s)]
*  Yeah, so right up front, President Trump was right the other day when he said, you know, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=415.84000000000003s)]
*  they used FISA Title One to spy on his campaign, and the FBI broke the law to do that. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=420.84000000000003s)]
*  They also, the FBI, abused Section 702 to spy on Americans unlawfully. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=426.12s)]
*  So the FBI did this to themselves. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=432.68s)]
*  They have abused this. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=434.68s)]
*  So I'm all for reforms. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=437.08000000000004s)]
*  I will say this, 56 reforms, 57 reforms, whether you're talking about a warrant requirement, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=438.64s)]
*  legislative solution isn't the process here. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=444.24s)]
*  There was a warrant requirement to spy on Carter Page, and the FBI broke that law four [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=446.28s)]
*  times to do that. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=451.84s)]
*  That's not an opinion. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=453.08s)]
*  That's a fact. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=454.52s)]
*  What really is needed here, Maria, is FBI leadership that says, if you take away this important [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=455.52s)]
*  tool that we use to keep presidents informed about national security threats, we're going [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=460.2s)]
*  to dedicate our time to make sure that you spend a considerable period of your life in [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=465.4s)]
*  federal prison. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=469.03999999999996s)]
*  And that's what's missing. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=470.03999999999996s)]
*  We have a problem with leadership, and it needs to be fixed. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=471.03999999999996s)]
*  Need consequences, of course. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=474.23999999999995s)]
*  John Radcliffe, thank you, former director of national intelligence. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=476.08s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyrw9K7OYAM&t=479.28s)]
