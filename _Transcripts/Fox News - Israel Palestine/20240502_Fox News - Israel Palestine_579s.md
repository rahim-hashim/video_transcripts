# Anti-Israel protesters at UCLA in standoff with law enforcement
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [May 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek)
*  Let's bring in criminal defense attorney Lexi Rigdon and Lexi, those are the individuals [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=0.0s)]
*  that are responsible for enforcing the law on the ground. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=4.98s)]
*  But from a law perspective, what are the legal ramifications for these students and the outside [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=7.74s)]
*  agitators who have been arrested or who might be arrested in the coming seconds, moments [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=13.74s)]
*  at UCLA? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=19.6s)]
*  Right, and hopefully they will be. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=20.6s)]
*  You name it, it's a smorgasbord of legal issues that they're facing. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=23.54s)]
*  If they're resisting arrest, if they're trespassing, if they're causing damage to property, they [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=27.74s)]
*  could have a lot of issues. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=32.9s)]
*  But as we've seen with some of these soft-sought crime policies, a lot of these charges are [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=34.14s)]
*  not necessarily pursued despite the fact that people are arrested. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=38.86s)]
*  And this is a general comment, not necessarily as to campus protests, but just a general [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=42.58s)]
*  comment as to the lax enforcement of these laws once it actually gets to the level of [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=47.14s)]
*  charging them. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=52.7s)]
*  So unfortunately, some of these protesters may just get a slap on the wrist. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=53.78s)]
*  They may get a summons to come to court. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=58.02s)]
*  So who knows how serious the consequences will be, but hopefully there are consequences, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=60.46s)]
*  because all of this behavior around the United States, these campuses, by the anti-Israeli [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=64.7s)]
*  protesters is egregious. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=69.38s)]
*  How does that calculus change when it comes to the fact that this is a public campus and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=71.5s)]
*  anybody, quite frankly, has a right to be on it? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=75.46000000000001s)]
*  It seems like that gives these protesters even another feather in their cap to fight [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=78.86s)]
*  these charges, in addition to the inevitable money spigot that will be turned on by these [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=84.8s)]
*  far-leftist organizations to pay for their defense. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=89.86s)]
*  Well, they certainly have a right to be on campus. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=92.89999999999999s)]
*  It is a public university, and there are free speech rights because it's a public institution. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=95.61999999999999s)]
*  But free speech obviously has a point. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=101.5s)]
*  The famous saying is that free speech only goes so far. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=103.94s)]
*  You can't yell fire in a crowded theater if there's no fire. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=106.9s)]
*  So free speech is not absolute. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=109.9s)]
*  There are time, place, and matter restrictions. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=111.9s)]
*  And obviously, if you're making comments and engaging in speech but also breaking the law [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=113.9s)]
*  at the same time, the fact that you are engaging in free speech is not going to save you from [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=121.02s)]
*  potentially facing consequences. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=126.02s)]
*  Alexi, you and I have talked on air. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=128.02s)]
*  We've talked off air about this general concept, this macro concept of law and order. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=130.5s)]
*  To me, Alexi, looking at the scenes on our screen right now, what you see is a complete [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=137.94s)]
*  function of the fact that our society has lost sight of when you do something wrong, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=143.38s)]
*  there are consequences. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=149.8s)]
*  And to hear your answer, you're exactly right. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=150.8s)]
*  I don't like your answer, but you're exactly right. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=153.98000000000002s)]
*  Inevitably, this is going to be a slap on the wrist for these people. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=156.9s)]
*  And what's to stop them from doing this again next year, next May Day, if not sooner? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=160.5s)]
*  And what's to stop every other student who thinks that they're aggrieved, much less [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=165.84s)]
*  every other person who wrongly thinks that they're aggrieved from acting out like this [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=170.89999999999998s)]
*  and basically making our country look horrible? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=175.5s)]
*  Yeah, it really does. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=179.1s)]
*  And you know, a lot of these schools, and it seems like even some of the higher, more [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=181.1s)]
*  quote unquote elite institutions have even more tolerance for this nonsense. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=185.86s)]
*  And it is a sad commentary on the state of America that there are this many people engaged [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=188.86s)]
*  in these types of protests. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=196.66000000000003s)]
*  I would venture to guess that most of these students a couple of months ago couldn't name [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=198.3s)]
*  two countries that bordered Israel. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=202.5s)]
*  And now all of a sudden they're putting their potential future and their education on the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=204.70000000000002s)]
*  line, I think essentially to be popular and be part of some cause. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=208.18s)]
*  And, you know, I'd almost have more respect for it if they were showing their faces and [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=213.5s)]
*  they were out there and they weren't making demands such as the students at Columbia, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=217.86s)]
*  which is please, please don't suspend us if they said this is so important to us. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=221.1s)]
*  We're willing to risk everything for this. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=224.74s)]
*  But they're not. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=226.42s)]
*  They're masked. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=227.26s)]
*  They're trying to hide themselves. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=228.38s)]
*  They're trying to make demands so that they can preserve their educational and other futures [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=229.86s)]
*  while still taking these extreme viewpoints. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=234.22s)]
*  It's like I said, it's a very sad state of affairs. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=236.58s)]
*  Yeah, they grew up in a world where there are no consequences. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=239.5s)]
*  They think this situation applies here. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=241.85999999999999s)]
*  Hopefully it does not. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=243.85999999999999s)]
*  Hopefully there are consequences to this action to tamp it down. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=245.1s)]
*  And I'm going to go one step further before I let you go, Lexi. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=248.1s)]
*  I think if you asked all those protesters right now, most of them still couldn't find Israel, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=250.7s)]
*  still couldn't find Gaza, still wouldn't know any of the countries surrounding Israel on a map. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=254.82s)]
*  Lexi Rigdon, thank you very much for your time this morning. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=259.1s)]
*  Let's bring back William Lajones back live at the UCLA campus. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=261.58s)]
*  William, what are you seeing right now? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=265.53999999999996s)]
*  Well, Todd, there hasn't been much change, right? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=268.9s)]
*  We still have, and I think the big question is going to be, what is this crowd going to do [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=270.86s)]
*  if and when police do move in, make a frontal assault here or the other side we talked about? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=274.38s)]
*  As I mentioned, there's still about a thousand people here, right? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=278.62s)]
*  They're not quite as vocal at the moment, but that can change on a dime, right? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=281.86s)]
*  And then as we talked about, there are still students, a lot of them, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=285.26s)]
*  along these side corridors that enter the camp in different spots. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=289.21999999999997s)]
*  Those are pretty much plugged up with individuals. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=294.34s)]
*  What are they going to do if and when they make an assault? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=296.78s)]
*  And if so, again, are they going to go through the building or are they going to go right here [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=300.18s)]
*  through the front or the backside as well? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=303.94s)]
*  That's another question. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=306.5s)]
*  Todd, what about the other audience of taxpayers, right? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=307.41999999999996s)]
*  So there's a lot of different constituencies here, right, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=310.46s)]
*  that the university is trying to please. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=313.9s)]
*  Not only the student body, you've got the alumni talking about, hey, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=316.09999999999997s)]
*  I sent my student there spending 20, 30, 40, 50 grand, depending if they're in state, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=319.97999999999996s)]
*  out of state, they're not getting an education, they're not going to class. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=324.21999999999997s)]
*  That's now postponed until Monday, as well as closing buildings. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=327.98s)]
*  They want something done here. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=331.82s)]
*  And then you've got taxpayers who are going to have to pay for the cleanup, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=333.34s)]
*  because I've been in some of these buildings, there's graffiti on the walls, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=336.3s)]
*  things to be done. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=339.54s)]
*  It's a mess at the university. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=340.66s)]
*  So again, we talked about the university being a rock and a hard spot. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=342.94s)]
*  I think, again, because of the counter protest and the danger that presented, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=346.34s)]
*  if you will, to both sides with the number of clubs and the bats and the gas and [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=350.62s)]
*  fireworks and all those things kind of happening, that the university said, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=356.18s)]
*  you know what, we have a liability here if we let this go on forever. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=359.74s)]
*  Now, don't get me wrong, they didn't do a lot. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=363.7s)]
*  They're mostly responsible for the situation we have here. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=366.97999999999996s)]
*  They even said there was a piece in the LA Times on Sunday and the university was [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=370.62s)]
*  kind of congratulating itself. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=374.97999999999996s)]
*  They were taking this hands off approach. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=376.3s)]
*  We're not going to beat Texas. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=377.94s)]
*  Well, you know what? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=378.97999999999996s)]
*  They made a decision more than a week ago to let this encampment happen. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=380.02s)]
*  And now they have to live with the consequences, right? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=383.94s)]
*  They didn't want to bring in police because that was going to be a bad thing. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=386.46s)]
*  That looked bad. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=389.21999999999997s)]
*  They didn't do it. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=390.09999999999997s)]
*  And now they have to bring in the police. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=390.7s)]
*  And a much worse situation as this encampment has literally reinforced itself, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=393.26s)]
*  the ramparts all day, bringing in the zip ties, tying these fences together, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=397.58s)]
*  bringing in more plywood. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=402.46s)]
*  How did they let that happen? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=403.7s)]
*  We witnessed it. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=405.09999999999997s)]
*  We're looking at are you crazy? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=405.85999999999996s)]
*  Letting them resupply this way? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=407.5s)]
*  Your guest just said, you know, cut them off, starve them up. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=409.38s)]
*  Could have done that days ago when they declared this unlawful. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=412.02s)]
*  They chose not to. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=414.9s)]
*  Not sure why. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=416.46s)]
*  And of course, the other decision is letting outsiders in because they have a list. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=417.7s)]
*  So to get into the encampment, if you were here two or three days ago, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=423.74s)]
*  there's a door they have to go through. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=427.06s)]
*  And they kind of vet these people and they let the students come and go, right? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=429.7s)]
*  And so they allowed it to be infiltrated, if you will, by outsiders. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=433.94s)]
*  Where's your ID? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=437.97999999999996s)]
*  Show it to me. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=438.85999999999996s)]
*  Are you a student here? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=439.46s)]
*  Where's your student ID? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=440.21999999999997s)]
*  Don't have it. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=440.97999999999996s)]
*  Don't get in. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=441.54s)]
*  That didn't happen. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=442.38s)]
*  So when we were saying here earlier today, today, seeing a lot of people in there [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=443.58000000000004s)]
*  clearly weren't students. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=447.82s)]
*  They might have been faculty. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=448.82s)]
*  If they're faculty, they tell the faculty because they know who they are. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=449.70000000000005s)]
*  Hey, don't do that. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=453.3s)]
*  Didn't happen. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=454.70000000000005s)]
*  So now they've got this pickle that they're in situation, which could get really long [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=455.66s)]
*  and ugly because we've seen some streaming video. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=460.5s)]
*  I don't know you have as well coming from the encampment. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=463.74s)]
*  They still have Wi-Fi and they're all they're all gassed up. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=466.86s)]
*  They got their masks, they got their helmets, they got their weapons. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=470.42s)]
*  So police could be facing that if they go in. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=472.7s)]
*  We knew yesterday, though, William, we knew yesterday that UCLA, when you scan the country [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=475.5s)]
*  at that point in time, literally 24 hours from this very moment, that UCLA was the bad [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=481.62s)]
*  spot in our country. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=486.78s)]
*  We knew that was the case. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=488.65999999999997s)]
*  How can the entire rest of the country know? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=490.86s)]
*  And UCLA bury its head in the sand with some more mealy mouth statements from the chancellor, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=493.38s)]
*  from the administration there and no real plan to deal with what everybody saw was inevitable, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=498.82s)]
*  which is what we're seeing on our screen right now. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=505.02s)]
*  William, it makes absolutely no sense. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=507.18s)]
*  Right. Yeah, they're behind the eight ball. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=511.94s)]
*  But, you know, I think it's perceptions again. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=513.26s)]
*  As you know, Todd, this is a very liberal city and a very liberal state. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=515.98s)]
*  And they did not want to perceive that they were somehow stepping on the free speech rights [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=519.98s)]
*  of the individuals inside. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=523.86s)]
*  So the decision was made over the past week not to intervene, to let it happen, let them [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=525.38s)]
*  have their say and so forth. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=530.18s)]
*  And there were supportive comments of that attitude or worldview among politicians here [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=532.02s)]
*  that, you know, you need to let people have their say and so forth. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=539.62s)]
*  And so they had a very different response, if you will, than Texas and Florida. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=543.42s)]
*  And that was a choice, a choice that they're now living with. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=547.18s)]
*  Todd? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=549.8599999999999s)]
*  And students are going to school at University of Florida today, whereas the students at [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=550.8599999999999s)]
*  UCLA not only can't go to school today, they're not going to go to school tomorrow, like you [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=555.06s)]
*  said, maybe Monday. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=559.02s)]
*  And when they go back, they're going to have to go to buildings that are full of graffiti. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=560.5s)]
*  I'll leave it to the viewer to determine which approach is better. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=563.8599999999999s)]
*  William, we'll check back in with you in a second. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6lxPPepOek&t=566.6199999999999s)]
