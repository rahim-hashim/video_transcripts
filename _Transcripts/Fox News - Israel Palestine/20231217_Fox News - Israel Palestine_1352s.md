*  by Hamas terrorists inside Gaza. They're in town to meet with President Biden. Join us tonight, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=5.36s)]
*  Ronan and Ornan Nutra, parents of Omer Nutra. Adi and Yael Alexander, parents of Idan Alexander. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=12.0s)]
*  Jonathan Dekel-Hen, father of Segey Dekel-Hen. Ruby Hen, father of Hittai Hen. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=20.8s)]
*  And Hittai's brother Roy. Also with us, Liz Neftali, great aunt to Abigail Moore Idan, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=30.08s)]
*  who was released November 26th. Thank you all for being here. I know this is a tough time, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=38.0s)]
*  and I know you have a specific message that you want to deliver to President Biden. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=44.72s)]
*  I want to talk about each one of your family members who's believed to be held hostage. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=50.08s)]
*  Jonathan, Segey, last seen where and tell me something about him. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=57.2s)]
*  Well, Segey is 35 years old. He's the father of three little girls, a newborn, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=64.56s)]
*  a two-year-old and a six-year-old. He was last seen on our kibbutz, kibbutz near Oz, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=72.24s)]
*  on October 7th at 9.30 in the morning. And from the testimony of hostages that were released [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=80.0s)]
*  a couple of weeks ago, we do know from within, from inside the tunnels that he has been, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=88.56s)]
*  that he is alive. Adi and Yael, Adi, you're the father of Idan. Tell me about him. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=95.92s)]
*  Idan grew up in Maryland, actually moved up to New Jersey, graduated last year from Teneflay [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=109.44s)]
*  High School and he choose to volunteer to IDF. He was kidnapped October 7th from his post, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=116.88s)]
*  from the IDF post. And since then we have no additional information about this abduction. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=127.12s)]
*  For a mother as you watch all of this, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=135.83999999999997s)]
*  what are you thinking and what's the message to Americans tonight? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=140.48s)]
*  Idan is my oldest son. He's 19 and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=146.32s)]
*  it's tough. It's tough to having the, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=152.95999999999998s)]
*  the, it's Hanukkah now. It's the season of it's, I'm sorry, I'm too nervous. I'm sorry. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=157.20000000000002s)]
*  It's tough. It's really tough. You know, Hanukkah is a celebration and... [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=167.36s)]
*  It's a celebration. It's a, it's a, it's a miracle is happening in Hanukkah time. And every night we [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=171.6s)]
*  are lighting the candles with his sister, Mika and his brother, Roy. And I'm just feeling sad, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=177.84s)]
*  full of hope that something is going to happen, something good and he will return home and [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=187.20000000000002s)]
*  everything will be good. But you know, I'm just, this is the hope. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=194.0s)]
*  It's hard. It's hard. Ronan, Orna, tell me about Omer. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  So Omer was born in New York, one month after 9-11. I remember that day. And I remember that I [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=203.68s)]
*  couldn't believe that this was happening as I can't believe that this is happening to us now again. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=213.44s)]
*  You know, to some extent he's like an all-American kid. He loves sports. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=220.96s)]
*  I think what's special about him is that he's a real connector. He really likes people. I think [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  if you asked him what his favorite thing to do is to just stay all night awake with his friends. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=232.88s)]
*  We're both dual citizens. And so he was accepted to Binghamton University, but decided to defer [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=238.8s)]
*  his school. And he went to Israel on a gap year. And he connected deeply with the country, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=246.08s)]
*  with his peers, and he decided to volunteer to the IDF. And he was taken from his post. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=254.72s)]
*  Ronan, when he volunteered for the IDF, what were you thinking? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=262.96s)]
*  It wasn't easy for us. But as Israelis, Americans, we served in the army as well. It's a reality in [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=266.0s)]
*  Israel that we all live with. And the difference was that he had an option. And it was a tough [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=273.44s)]
*  option. He made a decision after much deliberation, which we of course supported, but we didn't push [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=280.64s)]
*  for. So it's hard for us to think about him doing the right thing for the country and being on the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=289.03999999999996s)]
*  wrong place on the wrong time and being captured the way he was and taking him to Hamas. And we're [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=296.32s)]
*  doing everything we can to try and bring him back. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=301.91999999999996s)]
*  Ruby, tell me about your time. And when was last seen? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=305.28s)]
*  So I'm a New Yorker. Grew up in public school, did NYU. I've been living in Israel the last couple [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=310.32s)]
*  of years. I also went to the IDF. Protecting values of the Western society, liberty, democracy, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=320.96000000000004s)]
*  happened to be on the board of Gaza. He was abducted, kidnapped October 7th. He's the [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=332.48s)]
*  typically life of the party. He is a kid that is multi-talented, you know, sings, dances. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=341.76s)]
*  He also was in the Boy Scouts till the age of 18. So he has that mentor, you know, spirit inside [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=349.12s)]
*  of him. The vision that I am trying to keep is that, you know, he knows how to do card tricks. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=356.4s)]
*  Hopefully he has a deck of cards with him, like with the other people that are held in custody [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=362.79999999999995s)]
*  somewhere, hopefully passing time and some card tricks when waiting for us to kind of bring them [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=367.67999999999995s)]
*  back home. And you've got something, passing time. Yeah, so it's something, a message, the visual [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=375.84s)]
*  message, the ideas after 67 days, we don't have time. They don't have time. Each day that passes [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=381.28s)]
*  by, the probability of getting U.S. citizens back home is not good. And any meeting that I have with [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=389.11999999999995s)]
*  officials, Congress, White House officials, senators, Israeli officials, international officials, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=399.84s)]
*  I put this on the table to emphasize the fact that you're going back to your family, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=407.84s)]
*  you're going to have a nice dinner. We have an empty chair. And it's holiday season now, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=414.4s)]
*  Christmas is coming up. We want to be home. We don't want to wait for the administration [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=420.4s)]
*  or anyone else to tell us, well, let's talk again after the holidays. We don't have that time. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=428.47999999999996s)]
*  Okay. Raise that up just a little bit. We'll get a shot of it. That's very visual. And obviously, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=433.44s)]
*  it tells a story in and of itself. Roy, something, Roy, tell me something about it, Ty. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=440.40000000000003s)]
*  There's something about it, Ty. Ty, something very funny about it, Ty, is that he really loves [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=446.08000000000004s)]
*  basketball. And he loves it so much. Sometimes he goes to the court, even when he comes back from [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=453.04s)]
*  the army, he just never skips on going to the court and playing for a couple of hours. Sometimes [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=459.2s)]
*  I go with him. Sometimes we not. Even if I don't come with him, he still goes to the court to play [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=465.68s)]
*  basketball. So I think that is really, really passionate for him. Just adding at that. So I'm [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=470.15999999999997s)]
*  a New Yorker. So I'm across, I'm a suffering New York Knicks fan. So Roy inherited my love for the [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=476.4s)]
*  Knicks. Problem is he tied, decided to be a Kobe Bryant fan. So he became a Lakers fan. Isn't that [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=482.71999999999997s)]
*  what kids do? That's right. One team versus another. Liz, there is obviously a very bright story. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=487.52s)]
*  You're the great aunt of Abigail, four year old who was released. And she's so beautiful to see [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=494.4s)]
*  that video. But there's a horrible part to that story as well. Well, Abigail is a miracle because [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=499.84s)]
*  she survived both of her parents being murdered on October 7th. And she's a miracle because she [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=508.08s)]
*  crawled out from under her father's body and made her way to a neighbor home. And they took her in. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=517.52s)]
*  But she's also a miracle because then this mother and her three children, Abigail, were taken hostage [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=526.48s)]
*  by Hamas terrorists. And they were held for 50 days. And we prayed that Abigail would be [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=532.0799999999999s)]
*  taken care of by this woman and not be separated. And I will say that people all over the world [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=540.64s)]
*  different religions, different races, literally all over the world have sent to us and our family [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=547.3599999999999s)]
*  prayers and shared their prayers with us and with all of these folks. And Abigail is a miracle [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=552.16s)]
*  because she came back to Israel after 50 days. And you know, today we're celebrating Hanukkah. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=559.52s)]
*  And Hanukkah is a celebration of light and miracle. And we have Christmas coming up, which is [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=568.4799999999999s)]
*  another celebration of miracles. And I look at all of these people here whose children have not [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=574.72s)]
*  come back. And I pray and I ask people who are joining us and watching to pray for the miracle [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=582.4s)]
*  of Christmas that we should have these young people back home with their families. And I just say that [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=589.36s)]
*  Abigail is the light for her family. She is that beautiful four-year-old who runs around and hugs [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=597.6s)]
*  people and plays soccer like her big siblings and jumps in the pool. And we have that. And that is [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=606.72s)]
*  for all of us a blessing. And I really look to my friends here and now my family. And I pray for them [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=614.56s)]
*  to have that blessing as well. Yeah, you stand in solidarity with them as they wait. Just to go back [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=621.1999999999999s)]
*  to what you said at the beginning, she crawled out of from underneath her father. Yes. She was in his [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=626.88s)]
*  arms when a Hamas gunman shot him? Yes. So Abigail was in her father's arms running with the two, the [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=633.68s)]
*  six, and the ten-year-old. And the Hamas terrorist shot and killed him. And he fell over. And the [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=639.52s)]
*  older siblings thought that she had died also. And they locked, they ran home and locked themselves [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=647.2s)]
*  in a closet for 14 hours. But what we learned from an eyewitness a few days later because of all the [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=652.88s)]
*  confusion, all the craziness in this community was that Abigail had actually crawled out from under [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=659.2s)]
*  and gone to a neighbor who she knew. And they had taken her in and put her in their safe room. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=665.84s)]
*  And the husband had gone out to defend the kibbutz. He had been injured. And while all of this was [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=671.2s)]
*  happening, an eyewitness actually saw this mother and her three children and Abigail being marched [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=677.36s)]
*  off the kibbutz by Hamas terrorists. And then we didn't know anything about Abigail or this family [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=683.28s)]
*  for 50 days. Jonathan, there's a lot of fear. There's a lot of prayer. There has to be anger. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=688.16s)]
*  There has to be some feeling of is enough getting done. What is the message to President Biden that [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=696.72s)]
*  you bring? Well, I would say this. President Biden and the administration as a whole have been [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=704.88s)]
*  amazing partners in this struggle to get all of our loved ones back. Great efforts have been made. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=716.0s)]
*  We ask that even greater ones be invested now. These are critical moments. We really don't have [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=724.56s)]
*  time to waste. But one of the most gratifying parts of this horrific situation is to see that [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=733.76s)]
*  not only the Biden administration being entirely with not just the American Israeli families, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=740.32s)]
*  all of the hostage families committed to this, but also in Congress, which can be so divided these [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=746.4s)]
*  days to really have a wall-to-wall support amongst members in the House and in the Senate. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=751.76s)]
*  And it is a source of strength for all of us in these dark times. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=758.56s)]
*  Adi, when you hear of negotiations about ceasefires and all of the back and forth day to day, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=763.52s)]
*  what do you think? I think the hostages have to be returned. This is the real humanitarian crisis, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=770.3199999999999s)]
*  and that needs to happen first. And after that, I think the ceasefire can happen. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=780.4s)]
*  And that's what I think. And other news coverage of other things that you see day to day here in [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=787.4399999999999s)]
*  America? Ronan, what do you think of it? Well, obviously there is news coverage. But then [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=794.72s)]
*  sometimes we are so surprised that people are not aware that they don't know that there are [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=803.1999999999999s)]
*  eight American hostages. They're not aware that there are still 138 hostages left behind. This is [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=808.16s)]
*  a huge humanitarian crisis. The Red Cross is not allowed to go in. It's not there. We have no sign [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=815.6s)]
*  of life. Some of the people there are wounded, injured. They're not getting medicine. They're [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=821.6s)]
*  not getting any visitation rights. This is a horrible situation that needs to be resolved [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=827.12s)]
*  as quick as possible. We don't have time. Like Ruby is showing, the clock is ticking, and every day [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=833.28s)]
*  some of them may die. We gotta act. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=839.84s)]
*  I feel like we're reaching this boiling point, right? Where I'm afraid it can be too late. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=846.96s)]
*  You know, we try to keep up hope. I heard Ruby talking about [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=853.84s)]
*  the tie playing cards. You know, we try and keep up the hope and tell ourselves also stories, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=857.6s)]
*  you know, that keep us up. But the truth is that we hear from people that came back from there, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=862.88s)]
*  that the situation is dire. That they're kept under the ground, in the dark, no food. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=869.68s)]
*  We need to do something about it. Yalil, Yidan Strong can withstand [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=878.2399999999999s)]
*  this stuff. What's your thought about him in captivity? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=890.3199999999999s)]
*  I know my son, and I know he's strong. He's a professional swimmer. He's a cool guy. Yidan is [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=893.68s)]
*  the coolest, you know. Love extreme sport. He's doing everything. But I'm not... I hope that he's [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=904.3199999999999s)]
*  okay. You know, it's 67 days. And the people that came back and got rescued from there, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=915.92s)]
*  they're telling all these terrible stories. And I'm thinking about Yidan. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=923.52s)]
*  I hope that he's okay. You know, this is the hope. We all do. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=929.36s)]
*  Ruby, do you get a lot of outpouring of support from your community? Have you had [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=935.84s)]
*  people reach out? Yeah, it's been enormous, the amount of support that we're getting. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=941.12s)]
*  I'd actually like to move that question to the international community and where the US is [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=947.68s)]
*  getting its support. And, you know, we feel that the United States, as the leader of the free world, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=952.96s)]
*  there are different players in this ecosystem that can be doing more, and the US maybe can pressure [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=960.96s)]
*  a bit more, specifically Egypt, Qatar, other players that have influence in order to [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=965.8399999999999s)]
*  get a deal done. It's like the US and the international community need to be the adults. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=974.4s)]
*  They need to hammer out a deal that is acceptable by the international community [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=980.88s)]
*  and tell the kids, so to speak, okay, sign the dotted line, get the hostages out, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=984.9599999999999s)]
*  which is a humanitarian crisis, as well as what's happening in Gaza. Let's not [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=991.76s)]
*  forget the Palestinians are also hostages of the Hamas terrorist organization. It needs to end. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=995.4399999999999s)]
*  And you put the blame on Hamas, obviously. For sure. But, you know, we all live in an [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1001.28s)]
*  environment that we are influenced. Every single one of us at home, like, each one of us has a [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1008.88s)]
*  boss, each one of us lives in a community, each one of us has influence that can be made on them. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1014.4s)]
*  And the question is, how to influence Hamas to get to the negotiation table, as well as the state [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1022.56s)]
*  of Israel, by the way. We should point out that there are other American hostages not represented [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1027.68s)]
*  here. Hirsch is a 23-year-old from Chicago who was at that music festival. Keith is a 62-year-old [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1033.12s)]
*  from North Carolina, seized at a kibbutz there. And Gadi, 73, ambushed outside their home. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1041.04s)]
*  And I'm sure you all speak with for them, as well. You know, Liz, you mentioned Hanukkah [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1050.8s)]
*  and this festival of lights, a joyful celebration. And it's a miracle. It goes back to the reclaiming [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1057.68s)]
*  of the Holy Temple in Jerusalem from the Greeks. And, you know, the prayer at the first lighting [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1063.92s)]
*  of the menorah, English translation, includes, blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the universe, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1070.32s)]
*  who performed miracles for our forefathers in those days at this time. And I'm sure you all [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1077.04s)]
*  are hoping for a miracle. We say this every night at Hanukkah. It's, we bless the candles every night. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1084.1599999999999s)]
*  And we pray for our children to come home for all 137 of them that are held hostage. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1091.6s)]
*  And we pray for our leaders. And we ask, you know, everyone to pray for our children and to pray for [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1099.04s)]
*  the leaders and to keep them in their heart as we go into the holiday season. I'll add that Abigail [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1107.52s)]
*  is hope. Abigail is proof that when leaders want to come together to make an agreement, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1115.2s)]
*  people can be released. Abigail and another hundred hostages have been released. And I think that [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1124.0s)]
*  what we are asking for now is for leadership to stand up and to do even more to ensure that the [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1132.56s)]
*  Israelis, the Qataris, the Egyptians, the Jordanians, all the players in the region, put enough pressure, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1140.0s)]
*  and that will come from the United States and from the president and from his team, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1147.9199999999998s)]
*  to ensure that we can have another round of release, which releases the remaining hostages. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1152.08s)]
*  So Abigail and all of these hostages that have been released, mainly women and children and older [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1159.04s)]
*  folks, they have been released. We can do it again. And I believe that the president of the United [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1164.8799999999999s)]
*  States and his team are working really hard. But now is that time for us to make that push, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1171.84s)]
*  because as we've heard and we all hear in the press, the conditions these people are in and [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1178.72s)]
*  the conditions that they're living in are not going to be tenable for the next few weeks. And [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1183.4399999999998s)]
*  now is the time. Ruby's clock. I'd like to also remember in our prayers, the 1,500 [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1190.24s)]
*  people that were massacred, burned alive, beheaded by savages. I'd like also to mention [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1196.56s)]
*  over 100 Israeli soldiers that have gone into Gaza to find our kids, to find our loved ones, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1208.08s)]
*  and have been killed on that task. And we keep them in our prayers each night, saying thank you [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1218.8s)]
*  to them. And I'd also like to thank the American forces that are around Israel, ready to act [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1226.96s)]
*  on behalf of the American people. And we know that some families also suffered some losses, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1234.4s)]
*  and we are sympathizing with our loss. Anyone else? Well, I think every one of us [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1240.08s)]
*  who still has a loved one who is a hostage has a personal vision or a personal dream [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1248.56s)]
*  that in a way is manifest in that prayer, that point of light. And for me, it would be that Sagi, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1256.56s)]
*  I hope, walks on his own two feet into a room or down a hallway tomorrow, today, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1265.36s)]
*  and his little girls go leaping into his arms. And that for me is the miracle that I'm waiting [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1272.8s)]
*  to see. Miracles are godly in general. I think this time around, this is the work of men and women, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1280.0s)]
*  to come together and get all of these people home, overwhelmingly citizens, but also the soldiers [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1289.9199999999998s)]
*  among them. They are in captivity because of a savage assault on southern Israel. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1297.84s)]
*  There's a moral imperative to get them out. If there ever is to be hope for any kind of lasting [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1305.9199999999998s)]
*  peace in and around Israel, they have to come home alive. And that means now. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1314.6399999999999s)]
*  I pray well said. We appreciate you sharing your pain, your hope, your message with us. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1321.44s)]
*  This is not similar, but my son started with a lot of health problems when he was a baby. We were [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1330.96s)]
*  in the hospital a lot. And we used to pray we're one day closer to getting home. So we pray that [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1336.3999999999999s)]
*  you're one day closer. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1343.2s)]
*  you [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFkjGcmEU8s&t=1350.56s)]
