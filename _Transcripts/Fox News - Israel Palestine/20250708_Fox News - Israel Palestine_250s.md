# Trump has just shocked the world, says senator
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw)
*  For more on this, we want to bring in Republican Texas Senator John Cornyn. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator, good morning to you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Thanks for coming on today. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=6.08s)]
*  I'm sure you were listening into that press conference there. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=7.08s)]
*  A lot of people have questions about what happened. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=10.64s)]
*  What did you make about what you heard from the officials there? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=13.84s)]
*  Well, I think all these questions need to be answered, but not right now. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=16.44s)]
*  We need to assist and support the recovery effort. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=22.14s)]
*  As you can tell, it's an all hands on deck undertaking, starting with the president of [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=25.72s)]
*  the United States, the secretary of homeland security, and all of the incredible local [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=30.28s)]
*  officials that have been doing yeoman's work for the last several days. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=35.92s)]
*  I was there on Saturday, of course, with the governor, and there's no resources being spared [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  when it comes to this recovery effort. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=49.32s)]
*  As you know, there's still people missing, and families deserve to know what happened [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=51.48s)]
*  to their loved one. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  And I think what makes this particularly heartbreaking, Bill, is the fact that there were so many innocent [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=59.36s)]
*  child victims involved. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=65.52s)]
*  But there were more than that. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=67.53999999999999s)]
*  There were day campers who were there who were not part of any one of these summer camps. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=68.72s)]
*  And we don't know how many were there, so we don't know how high these numbers will [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=75.82s)]
*  go, but it's heartbreaking to be sure. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=80.12s)]
*  Yeah, and the current total, at least 105 dead, dozens still missing, some of them children. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=83.0s)]
*  Is there any hope right now that any of these folks are still going to be found alive, or [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=90.52000000000001s)]
*  is this largely shifting into, unfortunately, more of a recovery mission? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=94.56s)]
*  Well, hope springs eternal, and that's who we are. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  And we will hope for the best while we continue to do our due diligence, to do the recovery [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=104.64s)]
*  effort. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=110.28s)]
*  But obviously, with each hour that passes, the chances of finding another individual [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=111.28s)]
*  alive are diminished. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=117.64s)]
*  But we're not giving up hope. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=119.96000000000001s)]
*  And as the governor said on Saturday, we are not going to give up until we find every last [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=121.32s)]
*  individual who was affected by this terrible catastrophe. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=127.28s)]
*  Yeah, and unfortunately, those updates just keep getting worse. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=131.64s)]
*  We will keep tabs on Texas. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=134.64s)]
*  Do want to ask you about the cabinet meeting we're expected this morning. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=136.39999999999998s)]
*  That's supposed to kick off pretty much any minute now. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=139.48s)]
*  It was originally set for 11 a.m. at the White House. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  We're standing by waiting for that. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=144.11999999999998s)]
*  The meeting's going to happen after the dinner that President Trump had with Israeli Prime [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=146.11999999999998s)]
*  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last night. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=149.72s)]
*  Trump is still pushing for a proposed Israel Hamas ceasefire deal after he helped ease [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  tensions on other global conflicts. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=157.61999999999998s)]
*  Netanyahu is also announcing he endorsed Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=161.0s)]
*  So my question to you, Senator, is what are you expecting to hear out of this cabinet [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=164.0s)]
*  meeting? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=167.72s)]
*  And do you feel like we are potentially on the doorstep of finally getting a deal across [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=168.72s)]
*  the finish line when it comes to Israel Hamas? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=172.68s)]
*  Well, first, I'd just like to say I know President Trump is planning on coming to Central Texas [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=175.48s)]
*  on Friday. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=181.04s)]
*  I look forward to being with him, but demonstrating his concern for the victims and their families. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=182.04s)]
*  And to me, that is his priority. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=188.6s)]
*  But to your question, President Trump, I think, has surprised the world by being a peace president. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=191.04000000000002s)]
*  He's done more in the short period of time that he's been president than any other president [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=197.60000000000002s)]
*  in my memory to try to bring a cessation of hostilities and bring peace to troubled areas [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=202.0s)]
*  of the world. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=208.70000000000002s)]
*  In the case of Russia and Ukraine, unfortunately, he doesn't have a partner that he can deal [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=210.60000000000002s)]
*  with in Vladimir Putin, but Prime Minister Netanyahu, I hope, will be able to work out [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=217.46s)]
*  a peace plan in Gaza, get aid to people who've been suffering there as a result of the terrorist [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=223.3s)]
*  activity and the conflict. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=228.46s)]
*  Senator, I apologize. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=229.46s)]
*  Senator, I apologize. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=230.46s)]
*  We're coming up against a really hard break right here. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=231.46s)]
*  We thank you for your time. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=232.60000000000002s)]
*  Hey, everyone. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gTsM0yNxw&t=233.60000000000002s)]
