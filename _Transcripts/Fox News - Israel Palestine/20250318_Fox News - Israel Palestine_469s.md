# NEW: Israel strikes Gaza as Hamas ceasefire ends
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [March 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY)
*  Good morning, Carly and Todd. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=0.0s)]
*  So this marks the end of a weeks-long standoff, an effort to negotiate a second stage of the [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=1.8s)]
*  ceasefire. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=8.14s)]
*  What we are seeing today is Israel carrying out these strikes across part of the Strip. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=9.14s)]
*  You can see in some of the dark footage there of these strikes lighting up the sky with [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=13.700000000000001s)]
*  the idea of saying it's going after Hamas targets like officials and infrastructure. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=18.78s)]
*  The renewed fighting comes during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=23.18s)]
*  Footage this morning shows the widespread extent of some of the damage across the Strip. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=27.3s)]
*  The first stage of the ceasefire ended two weeks ago. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=32.3s)]
*  Negotiators have yet to hammer out a second stage, which would free the remaining hostages. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=36.06s)]
*  Israel's Defense Minister saying this, quote, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=40.58s)]
*  The decision comes after Hamas repeatedly refused to release their hostages and rejected [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=43.18s)]
*  all proposals presented by U.S. President's envoy Steve Witkoff as well as the mediators. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=47.54s)]
*  As Israel renews its offensive against Hamas, President Trump is also giving a warning to [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=53.98s)]
*  Yemen's Houthis and Iran, posting this online. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=58.94s)]
*  Every shot fired by the Houthis will be looked upon from this point forward as being a shot [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=63.14s)]
*  fired from the weapons and leadership of Iran. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=67.88s)]
*  And Iran will be held responsible and suffer the consequences, and the consequences will [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=71.02s)]
*  be dire. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=75.64s)]
*  And his press secretary laying out the message even further. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=76.64s)]
*  As President Trump has made it clear, Hamas, the Houthis, Iran, all those who seek to terrorize, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=81.94s)]
*  not just Israel, but also the United States of America, will see a price to pay. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=89.53999999999999s)]
*  All hell will break loose. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=95.14s)]
*  The Houthis, Hezbollah, Hamas, Iranian-backed terror proxies, and Iran themselves should [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=96.9s)]
*  take President Trump very seriously when he says he is not afraid to stand for law-abiding [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=102.25999999999999s)]
*  people. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=108.25999999999999s)]
*  We are not afraid to stand up for the United States of America and our friend and our ally, Israel. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=109.26s)]
*  And Israel says that it will continue to lay out this military pressure, something that [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=116.14s)]
*  it says it will do, as long as necessary. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=121.22s)]
*  Carly Thon, back to you. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=124.42s)]
*  Alex Hogan live for us in London. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=125.42s)]
*  Alex, thank you. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=126.86000000000001s)]
*  Let's bring in former Assistant Secretary of State for George W. Bush, Robert Charles. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=127.86000000000001s)]
*  Robert, the IDF says that it learned Hamas used the pause in fighting to stock up on [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=131.86s)]
*  weapons in preparation for new attacks. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=136.46s)]
*  Did Israel have any other choice than to do what it did last night? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=139.3s)]
*  No, Todd, actually, and good morning to you all. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=143.86s)]
*  It's absolutely a fact that Israel is, and with Donald Trump's full support and the support [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=148.54000000000002s)]
*  of the United States of America, is making clear that we're back to a world of geopolitical [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=153.22s)]
*  consequences. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=157.58s)]
*  Having spent a lot of time over in the Middle East, I will just tell you that sometimes [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=158.58s)]
*  you have to be blunt in order to get the message through. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=162.78s)]
*  What he's saying quite clearly is that Hamas and the Houthis and probably Hezbollah are [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=165.5s)]
*  out over their skis. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=170.85999999999999s)]
*  And at the end of the day, I'll tell you, the consequences of this could be that there's [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=172.26s)]
*  no one to have a ceasefire with when Israel is done, because Hamas may be in their final [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=176.2s)]
*  days. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=181.29999999999998s)]
*  OK, so over the weekend, the president ordered airstrikes against Houthis in Yemen. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=182.3s)]
*  And then yesterday, as Alex was just reporting, President Trump put Iran on notice, said every [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=186.78s)]
*  shot fired by the Houthis will be looked upon from this point forward as being a shot fired [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=192.72s)]
*  from weapons and leadership of Iran. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=197.44s)]
*  Iran will be held responsible. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=200.55999999999997s)]
*  Will this action taken by the president, followed by this statement putting Iran on notice, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=202.92s)]
*  change the posture of the Iranian regime? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  It's an excellent question. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  You know, it depends how quickly they get the message. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=213.39999999999998s)]
*  At the end of the day, these are all tentacles of Iran. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=215.83999999999997s)]
*  Iran bankrolls Hamas and bankrolls Hezbollah and the Houthis. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=218.64s)]
*  And I think at the end of the day, Iran's got to think very, very hard about what this [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=222.67999999999998s)]
*  president means. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=226.44s)]
*  Donald Trump means what he says and says what he means. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=227.44s)]
*  And thank God there is someone like Donald Trump there. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=230.64s)]
*  I mean, there have been too many presidents who have been waffling, and in particular [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=233.0s)]
*  waffling in their support of Israel. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=237.48s)]
*  And I think at the end of the day, this is a new world order for Iran. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=240.32s)]
*  They're going to have to sit up, recognize that the next thing that happens is potential [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=243.67999999999998s)]
*  strikes against their assets. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=248.16s)]
*  And I think he's making it crystal clear. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=249.56s)]
*  Do not miss the message. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=251.84s)]
*  The message is for you, Iran. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=253.76s)]
*  You get it right or you're going to pay a consequence you wish you didn't have to pay. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=255.48s)]
*  Robert, you said something in your answer to my question that I want to jump off of. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=259.0s)]
*  You said if this continues down the path that it currently looks like it is, there may not [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=262.6s)]
*  be a Hamas to negotiate with because it may be wiped off the face of the earth. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=267.52s)]
*  Do you ultimately think that there is any proposal at this point after we've gone back [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=271.92s)]
*  and forth for months now, is there any proposal that Hamas would agree to? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=276.8s)]
*  Or in the end, is this a fight to the end for them? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=281.12s)]
*  You know, it's an excellent question, Todd. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=285.24s)]
*  It really is. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=287.0s)]
*  You know, is this, you know, are we going to think about Hamas like the Bolsheviks and [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=288.0s)]
*  the SS that they once were and they are no more? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=291.52s)]
*  Or is there any room at all for a conversation? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=294.52s)]
*  You know, I would tell you that at some point all trust is lost. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=296.8s)]
*  And if all trust is lost, this is the end of Hamas. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=300.58s)]
*  If on the other hand, there's an immediate turn of tide and, you know, they change of [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=303.24s)]
*  heart and they can get these 11 hostages out of there, maybe there's some room to bring [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=308.44s)]
*  Hamas, whatever's left of it, back into the political process. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=312.8s)]
*  But you know, I feel very badly not only for Israel, of course, because Israel is the constant [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=316.64s)]
*  victim here, but, you know, Hamas has basically victimized the Palestinians in Gaza all over [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=321.56s)]
*  again. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=327.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=328.2s)]
*  We have four living Israeli-American hostage in Gaza, Edon Alexander, and four deceased. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=329.2s)]
*  And we eagerly await for their return to Israel or the United States and pray that that does [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=335.2s)]
*  take place. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=340.56s)]
*  So last week, Robert, Russian President Vladimir Putin says he is open to a ceasefire deal, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=342.08s)]
*  but he did not agree to the negotiated one that Ukraine side on to. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=346.84s)]
*  He said that he wants to have a phone call, a phone conversation with President Trump. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=351.59999999999997s)]
*  That conversation is happening today, which seems like a pretty significant moment. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=355.48s)]
*  How do you feel about it? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=360.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, how do I feel about it, Carly? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=362.08000000000004s)]
*  First of all, doesn't it just show you we're in a whole new world where Putin is calling [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=364.76s)]
*  Trump to please include me in the peace deal and let's see where we can go? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=369.24s)]
*  Look, there are significant reasons for Russia to come to the table right now. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=373.48s)]
*  They're using North Korean troops. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=377.88s)]
*  They're using Chinese drones. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=379.6s)]
*  They're exhausted. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=382.08000000000004s)]
*  The popular opinion in Russia is beginning to turn. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=383.47999999999996s)]
*  They don't even send the pine boxes home like in Vietnam. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=386.76s)]
*  They literally just bury people on the battlefield, and mothers know when their sons don't come [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=390.52s)]
*  home. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=394.47999999999996s)]
*  So I think at some point here, this was a war of attrition that was eventually going [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=395.47999999999996s)]
*  to stop. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=399.64s)]
*  But what's fascinating is that Donald Trump is really taking a page, in my view, from [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=400.64s)]
*  Theodore Roosevelt, 1905. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=404.79999999999995s)]
*  Russia and China were at war with each other. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=407.44s)]
*  China, I'm sorry, Russia and Japan were at war with each other. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=409.4s)]
*  Japan had attacked Russia. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=412.52s)]
*  And that war ended when territory that Japan had taken, Port Arthur and part of the Sakhalin [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=415.08s)]
*  Islands, was negotiated out in a way that allowed Japan to keep the territory, but a [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw-uDbghRjY&t=421.52s)]
