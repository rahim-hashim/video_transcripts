# ‘BITTERSWEET’: Parents of American hostage react to possible cease-fire deal
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE)
*  The parents of Israeli American hostage Omer Nutra calling this a deal with the devil, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=0.0s)]
*  but support the compromise. They hope for the return of their son's body so he can be buried [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=5.84s)]
*  properly. Omer's parents Ronan and Orna are joining us now and welcome to both of you. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=10.72s)]
*  For so many of us who have been watching and following your story, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=17.12s)]
*  we can only imagine how you feel in this moment. Please do share with us your thoughts. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=21.68s)]
*  It's a tough moment. On the one hand, we're very, you know, we're happy and excited for [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=25.84s)]
*  the families that will hopefully get to see their loved ones after such a long time. You know, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=36.08s)]
*  it's been over a year since the previous release and this is long overdue. We've been advocating [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  for this fiercely for such a long time. And of course, for us, it's unfortunate that [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=49.52s)]
*  we received the news a month and a half ago that Omer was killed on October 7th. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=57.040000000000006s)]
*  Obviously, we were devastated and this is something we are going to have to deal with. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=65.44s)]
*  But even after receiving that news, Omer is still not home and he hasn't been [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  since October 7th. So we are looking forward to beginning this deal finally [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=77.67999999999999s)]
*  and pushing through all the phases because Omer is not expected to be brought back in the first [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=84.24s)]
*  phase. And we need to make sure that he is brought back and that he receives a respectful burial. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=90.72s)]
*  Ronan, we're looking at beautiful pictures of your son and your beautiful family. And [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=97.84s)]
*  we grieve with you and we are so sorry for everything that your family has gone through. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=102.0s)]
*  How are you doing and what are your thoughts in this moment? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=107.04s)]
*  It's tough. We've been going back and forth to Israel, to Washington. I believe we've [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  met with the National Security Advisor 17, 18 times. We saw hundreds of congressmen and senators. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=121.28s)]
*  We have so much support and love here in the United States and around the world. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=130.4s)]
*  So many people prayed, yet we had to deal with our own private loss. Our son Omer, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=134.8s)]
*  who was the head of the small post next to Gaza, and his job was to protect the villages around [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=142.8s)]
*  Gaza in a very peaceful, quiet, early morning, rushed to the border as a first responder together [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  with his team and met the most vicious terrorist group that took him after they killed some of [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=160.0s)]
*  his team members. They took him alive and he died in Gaza, as far as we are told. And they are [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=170.08s)]
*  holding his body ever since. Who does that? All major religions are against holding bodies. They [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=178.32s)]
*  are using bodies as negotiation chips. We are just appalled from the whole situation and obviously [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=185.44000000000003s)]
*  praising the incoming Trump administration for joining all the efforts that were done by the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=196.32000000000002s)]
*  Biden administration, leading to this moment where the deal is finally announced yesterday. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=204.16000000000003s)]
*  But it's a very bittersweet deal because it's fragile. And as Omer said, we are going to see [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=210.8s)]
*  our son only in the upcoming stages, not in the first one. And we must make sure that we hold [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=218.64s)]
*  everybody accountable to moving between the stages and making them short as possible, negotiate [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=228.16s)]
*  right now about the second and the third stages and making sure that all the 98 hostages, including [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=234.72s)]
*  our beloved son, will return home and we can give him proper burial. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=241.12s)]
*  Are you optimistic that they're going to follow through on this and bring your son's body home? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=247.36s)]
*  Like Ronan said, we've been in touch with the Biden administration for this whole year [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=257.2s)]
*  and we've only been able to see traction in the past few weeks on this deal with the incoming [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=262.32000000000005s)]
*  President-elect Trump and his team engaging in the process and assisting the Biden team. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  And we're really hopeful that this new administration will be able to bring the [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=277.44s)]
*  deal to fruition and will have enough, all the gravitas to put on the different parties in the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=282.72s)]
*  region to follow through on it. We trust President Trump that this is important to him and that he [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=290.72s)]
*  will make sure that this happens. Our hearts and our thoughts and our prayers are constantly with [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=298.48s)]
*  you all and all the families of the hostages and we pray for you. Thank you very much for coming on. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=303.36s)]
*  Thank you. And we will be in the inauguration. We'll be wearing the family's yellow scarves [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=310.08000000000004s)]
*  and we're going to be there to make sure that this issue is not forgotten and we're hoping [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=316.64s)]
*  to get the support from the crowd, from the media, and of course from the upcoming administration. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=323.59999999999997s)]
*  And thank you so much. We'll be there and we'll see you there. Thank you very much. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=329.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKiYIFHvAE&t=333.68s)]
