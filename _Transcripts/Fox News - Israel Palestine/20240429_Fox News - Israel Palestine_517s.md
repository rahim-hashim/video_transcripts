# Kayleigh McEnany: This headline is unbelievable
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o)
*  The anti-Israel demonstrations quickly spreading from colleges on the East Coast through the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=0.0s)]
*  Midwest as far as Texas and onto California. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=6.72s)]
*  Protests and encampments are descending into full-on clashes with police. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  And now those protesters who might actually face some consequences are demanding amnesty. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=15.6s)]
*  Hello everyone. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=22.48s)]
*  This is Outnumbered. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=23.48s)]
*  I'm Emily Campagno here with my co-hosts, Kaylee McEnany and Harris Faulkner. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=24.48s)]
*  And also joining us today, Fox News contributor Lisa Booth and Fox News contributor and former [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=29.08s)]
*  Utah Congressman Jason Chaffetz. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  Now there have been growing calls for crackdowns on the anti-Israel protests at campuses across [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=37.28s)]
*  the country. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=42.32s)]
*  We're now learning that University of Georgia police and Georgia State Patrol troopers have [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  arrested multiple demonstrators during an anti-Israel protest at the Athens campus just [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=48.28s)]
*  a short time ago. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=53.56s)]
*  There have reportedly been nearly 900 arrests at protests across the country so far. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=55.6s)]
*  And now Columbia is giving students camped out on the campus a deadline. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  They say 2 p.m. Eastern today is the deadline for them to leave or face suspension. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=65.72s)]
*  Final exams, financial aid and even graduation are now on the line. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=72.0s)]
*  But those righteous students and professors taking part in the anti-Israel demonstrations [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=76.56s)]
*  are demanding that the school grant them amnesty. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=81.28s)]
*  They don't want their arrests and suspensions to follow them after college. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=85.28s)]
*  Jason, to me it doesn't matter what they want or demand. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=89.88s)]
*  I don't think hostages once or demands were frankly taken into consideration when they [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=93.4s)]
*  were butchered and taken hostage by Hamas. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=98.28s)]
*  And certainly those who identify with Hamas then shouldn't receive any type of amnesty [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=100.68s)]
*  from school administrators for them having a tantrum on campus and sympathizing with [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=105.12s)]
*  terrorists. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=109.32s)]
*  Yeah, punks, welcome to the real world. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=110.32s)]
*  They're going to have to live up to the consequences of their actions. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=112.44s)]
*  All 900 plus of these people who broke the law should be prosecuted. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=119.12s)]
*  If you broke the school rules, you should probably be expelled because you're talking [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=123.92s)]
*  about killing other people. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=127.7s)]
*  Is there any more hateful speech than that? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=130.46s)]
*  So yeah, they got to hold them accountable. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=133.16s)]
*  Amnesty? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=134.92s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=135.92s)]
*  Look, it is as American as it gets to protest, but you have to do so peacefully. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=137.48s)]
*  And when you call for the death and destruction of others, including your classmates, then [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=143.11999999999998s)]
*  guess what? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=148.32s)]
*  There's a real world consequence and it is not amnesty. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=149.32s)]
*  And I think it's rich, Lisa, to expect in any way that if your protest, if your demonstration [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=152.11999999999998s)]
*  is again sympathizing with terrorism, that you would think you would get off scot-free [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=157.32s)]
*  that these people who have the luxury of probably never having gone hungry, never having a slap [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=160.72s)]
*  on their wrist, never being bored, never having a phone outside of their hand, et cetera, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=165.57999999999998s)]
*  actually think they are immune from consequences from their childish and demonic behavior. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=168.94s)]
*  But they have been, you know, thus far, right? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=174.34s)]
*  I mean, these students are saying they're standing against genocide, but they subscribe [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=176.94s)]
*  to the same belief system that led to the Holocaust. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=181.45999999999998s)]
*  You know, and we're witnessing a hostile takeover of colleges and universities across the country, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=185.29999999999998s)]
*  but this began and started a long time ago. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=190.98s)]
*  And it started when these universities replaced academic excellence with social justice warriors, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=194.22s)]
*  with activism. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=200.46s)]
*  I mean, you go back to 2017 when Stanford accepted a student for writing Black Lives [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=201.46s)]
*  Matter 100 times on his essay. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=205.78s)]
*  Or Heritage did a study in 2021 looking at 741 DEI personnel at 65 universities across [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=208.42000000000002s)]
*  the country and found that 96% of the tweets from that personnel were anti-Israel. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=215.06s)]
*  So of course what we're seeing needs to be universally condemned. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=220.46s)]
*  It is wrong, it is evil, these students are wrong, the faculty and the teachers are wrong as well. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=223.45999999999998s)]
*  And so are the administrators. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=227.94s)]
*  But it's going to take a long time to wrestle back, you know, universities and colleges [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=229.94s)]
*  from what we've seen. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=234.61999999999998s)]
*  And Kayleigh, let's talk about the real world for a second, because while, for example, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=236.61999999999998s)]
*  the 100 professors at Columbia University signed on to this despicable letter by the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=239.66s)]
*  students that called the Hamas grotesque massacre a military action, sure, maybe they'll absolve [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=244.14s)]
*  these demonstrators of, okay, fine, your suspension won't be on your record. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=250.54s)]
*  But guess who was in charge of, for example, hiring at one of my prior places of employment? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=254.22s)]
*  I was. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=258.53999999999996s)]
*  And it matters to me as it does to my prior place of employment. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=259.53999999999996s)]
*  And in the private sector, people who have sympathized with terrorism, people who call [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=262.38s)]
*  for genocide and extermination of the people. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=266.86s)]
*  So go ahead and enjoy your college record being totally easy breezy. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=269.7s)]
*  But the reality is the private sector won't be so forgiving. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=273.53999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, you may have your first amendment right, but you should be unemployable if you exercise [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=276.3s)]
*  that right irresponsibly and advocate for terrorism for Hamas or against Jewish men [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=280.66s)]
*  and women, which is what we are seeing. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=286.46s)]
*  I could not believe the headline on the New York Post about George Washington University [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=288.1s)]
*  right there nestled in the heart of DC horror as GWU protester Kerry sign with Nazi final [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=292.42s)]
*  solution sign calling for the extermination of Jews. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=299.06s)]
*  So it's anti-Semitism. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=303.38s)]
*  It's leaning into the Holocaust. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=304.88s)]
*  There needs to be consequences for that. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=307.2s)]
*  George Washington University, they found the guts to change their name from the Colonials [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=308.82000000000005s)]
*  to the revolutionaries when they incurred criticism. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=313.98s)]
*  So a little bit of criticism for your mascot. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=316.66s)]
*  You change that. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=318.70000000000005s)]
*  What about these students who have talked about the final solution? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=319.78000000000003s)]
*  Where's the consequence? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=323.5s)]
*  We need leadership right now. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=324.66s)]
*  Right now in Colombia, you mentioned two p.m. deadline to leave the encampment. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=326.26000000000005s)]
*  Well, what's going to happen in an hour and 55 minutes? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=329.26000000000005s)]
*  Are they actually going to take action? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=331.46000000000004s)]
*  What's going to happen in Congress where Mike Johnson has said, let's pull funding from [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=333.5s)]
*  these universities if you allow anti-Semitism. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=337.42s)]
*  What's going to happen with the Anti-Semitism Awareness Act, which is condemning anti-Semitism? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=339.54s)]
*  Apparently there are some Democrats who don't want to vote for it. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=344.38s)]
*  And what's going to happen in the White House? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=346.46s)]
*  Our Fox News digital reached out to the Biden administration and said, will you pull student [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=348.1s)]
*  loan debt forgiveness from someone engaging in anti-Semitism? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=352.58s)]
*  Guess what we heard? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=356.06s)]
*  Crickets, crickets. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=357.06s)]
*  Where are you, Joe? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=358.58s)]
*  But we know, for example, Harris, Robert Kraft pulled funding from Colombia, right? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=359.58s)]
*  He said it was despicable, this anti-Semitism. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=362.94s)]
*  So we've seen at least, again, that private sector accountability. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=364.86s)]
*  Will we see it from this government? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=368.02000000000004s)]
*  Will we see it from these campuses? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=369.54s)]
*  Among the views we've seen. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=370.54s)]
*  Anything besides don't. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=371.94s)]
*  I mean, what we haven't seen is corporate America, you know, as a whole come out and [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=372.94s)]
*  saying you've got some tweets from Elon Musk, which are posts from Elon Musk, which I picked [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=377.06s)]
*  up just recently. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=381.58000000000004s)]
*  But wholly, you're not seeing any of that from a broader corporate life. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=383.82s)]
*  I would put it this way. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=389.90000000000003s)]
*  900 arrests. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=391.78000000000003s)]
*  900 arrests. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=393.3s)]
*  That'll give you an idea of how big these crowds are. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=395.38000000000005s)]
*  They didn't say we arrested everybody and the number was 900. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=397.98s)]
*  They said of everybody who was out there, we picked up 900. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=401.42s)]
*  These are campuses that are overrun by these people. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=404.82000000000005s)]
*  And I think it's worth having a conversation about the money that's flowing from people [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=407.86s)]
*  like George Soros and his organizations and his son Alexander, who was reportedly much [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=412.52000000000004s)]
*  more an activist than his dad ever was. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=417.58000000000004s)]

*  So what are they learning? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=459.7s)]
*  They're learning how to teach us to be numb. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=461.02s)]

*  Why don't they dispatch some adult acting surrogates and get the word out there that [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=473.98s)]
*  no one is going to tolerate hate on the streets of America? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNj_iS8w6o&t=478.78000000000003s)]
