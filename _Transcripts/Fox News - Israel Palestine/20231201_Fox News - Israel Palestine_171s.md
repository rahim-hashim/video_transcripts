# Fighting resumes as Israel-Hamas cease-fire expires
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdMNHTCuKs)
*  a Fox News alert sirens blaring in Israel as the ceasefire with Hamas ends and fighting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdMNHTCuKs&t=0.0s)]
*  resumes great Palcott live in southern Israel at the very latest Greg. Yeah folks after [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdMNHTCuKs&t=17.48s)]
*  a week's pause, the fighting is on the war between Israel and Hamas is raging again. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdMNHTCuKs&t=25.32s)]
*  We're just about a mile from the northern part of Gaza Strip at our location here. I'm [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdMNHTCuKs&t=32.72s)]
*  going to step aside and let cameraman Ben give you a sense of the landscape here. In [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdMNHTCuKs&t=37.8s)]
*  the last hour or so, we've been seeing Israeli airstrikes. We've been hearing Israeli artillery. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdMNHTCuKs&t=43.08s)]
*  You might see a little bit of smoke coming from there. There was a whole bunch of smoke [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdMNHTCuKs&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  coming from there about a half hour ago again. We're also hearing automatic gunfire, a sign [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdMNHTCuKs&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  of clashes on the ground. Remember, there could be thousands of Israeli soldiers there. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdMNHTCuKs&t=61.040000000000006s)]
*  The strongest strikes have been in the southern part of the Gaza Strip. That is a Hamas stronghold. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdMNHTCuKs&t=66.28s)]
*  How do we get here? Well, both sides are blaming each other. After over 100 hostages were [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdMNHTCuKs&t=71.44s)]
*  freed, Israel says Hamas did not present an adequate set of new captives to be released [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdMNHTCuKs&t=75.76s)]
*  before the ceasefire was set to end at around 7 a.m. local time. Hamas sent off some rockets [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdMNHTCuKs&t=82.04s)]
*  to the neighboring villages where we are right now. And that was that. Following that, Israel [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdMNHTCuKs&t=87.72s)]
*  announced it was resuming strikes, hitting a variety of locations, again, trying to go [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdMNHTCuKs&t=93.08s)]
*  for what is now the temporary headquarters of the Hamas leadership around the Khan Yunis [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdMNHTCuKs&t=97.28s)]
*  area, warning people to flee. But we already heard that dozens of people have been killed, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdMNHTCuKs&t=102.16s)]
*  according to Hamas. And Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office released a statement saying [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdMNHTCuKs&t=107.24s)]
*  in part, upon the resumption of fighting, we emphasize the government of Israel is committed [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdMNHTCuKs&t=112.19999999999999s)]
*  to achieving the goals of the war, releasing the hostages, eliminating Hamas, ensuring [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdMNHTCuKs&t=117.72s)]
*  Gaza never again constitutes a threat to the residents of Israel. Remember last night we [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdMNHTCuKs&t=122.61999999999999s)]
*  did see the last, for now it seems, of the released hostages, seven women and one man [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdMNHTCuKs&t=127.72s)]
*  starting at a teenage level. And while negotiators today say they're looking to restart the ceasefire, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdMNHTCuKs&t=133.4s)]
*  experts say that is unlikely to happen. It looks like we've got war again. And remember, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdMNHTCuKs&t=139.44000000000003s)]
*  guys, as we watch this, as we watch the Israeli Air Force hit targets, as we see smoke come [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdMNHTCuKs&t=144.4s)]
*  up, hear a lot of booms, there are still hostages there, too, maybe as many as 140 that haven't [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdMNHTCuKs&t=151.4s)]
*  been freed. So retrieving the hostages as well as dealing with Hamas, it's a double [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdMNHTCuKs&t=157.6s)]
*  barreled target and strategy for Israel. Back to you. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdMNHTCuKs&t=163.4s)]
*  Thank you very much, Greg. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdMNHTCuKs&t=168.4s)]
