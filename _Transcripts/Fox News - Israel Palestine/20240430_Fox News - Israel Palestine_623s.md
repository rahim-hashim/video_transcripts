# Anti-Israel protesters are going 'far beyond' the First Amendment, attorney warns
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE)
*  A Fox News alert breaking right now at Columbia University. Protesters have [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=0.0s)]
*  stormed and taken over an academic building on campus called Hamilton Hall. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=5.28s)]
*  They're smashing windows forming an actual barricade inside. There are also [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=9.64s)]
*  some reports of some workers at Columbia saying they felt they were being held [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  hostage by these protesters inside the building. Constitutional attorney Mark [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=20.48s)]
*  Smith joins us now to talk about the criminal and legal aspects to all of [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=25.88s)]
*  this. So Mark, beyond university discipline, what laws have these [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=30.439999999999998s)]
*  individuals, these protesters, broken by doing what they're doing, what we've [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=35.44s)]
*  reported so far, what you've seen? Well of course it all depends, Todd, but the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=40.14s)]
*  reality is the First Amendment right to free speech does not allow you to break [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=46.04s)]
*  the law. In other words, you can still be subject to violating criminal laws such [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=49.96s)]
*  as trespass if you enter onto private or public property that you're not allowed [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=54.04s)]
*  to be in. Also if you destroy private or public property you can be held [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=58.48s)]
*  liable for destroying property. And of course if you assault someone physically [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=63.44s)]
*  you're not allowed to do that. So exercising your right to protest, exercising [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=67.48s)]
*  your right to free speech, that's fine. But there's a famous saying, Todd, by former [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=72.64s)]
*  Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes that says my right to swing my [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=76.56s)]
*  fist stops at the end of your nose. So free speech and protest is one thing. If [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=81.28s)]
*  you start destroying property, assaulting people, breaking and entering, now you're [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=87.08s)]
*  into a whole different world. They're called time, place, and manner [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=91.8s)]
*  restrictions on the free speech right, but this is well beyond that. I mean this [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=95.08s)]
*  is clear illegality. Columbia University is a private campus really calling into [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=100.2s)]
*  question the notion of free speech to begin with. You know if you're in a [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=104.8s)]
*  private setting, your speech, let's face it, can be controlled but we are so far [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=108.32s)]
*  well beyond that. If, and this is a big if especially in a city like New York, if [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=113.52s)]
*  the New York District Attorney actually decides to charge these people, what are [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=119.0s)]
*  we looking at here? Are we looking at misdemeanors? Are we looking at [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=124.32s)]
*  felonies? Are we looking at something that could put these people in jail for [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=126.6s)]
*  some significant amount of time? Well the first thing I would say Todd is it [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=130.64s)]
*  depends on what Columbia University wants because if there is a victim [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=135.8s)]
*  presumably it would be Columbia University and you raise an excellent [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=139.88000000000002s)]
*  point that the First Amendment as a general rule only applies to government [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=143.48000000000002s)]
*  actors. Columbia University is a private institution. They're not the government. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=147.68s)]
*  So arguably speaking the First Amendment really doesn't play a role here because [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  they're a private institution, but you're absolutely right. To the extent that [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=156.44s)]
*  Columbia University believes that their property has been destroyed, that their [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=159.52s)]
*  employees have been violated in some illegal way, well then Columbia [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=163.64s)]
*  University can follow criminal complaint with the District Attorney and the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=167.04s)]
*  District Attorney and the police can take actions as if this were any other [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=170.32s)]
*  situation where you arrest the alleged perpetrators, you bring them into court, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=174.04s)]
*  you let them plead guilty or not guilty and you take it there and then of course [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=177.92s)]
*  the District Attorney can decide whether or not to plea out the case or pursue the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=181.6s)]
*  case or not pursue the case, but certainly if you look at what happened [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=184.95999999999998s)]
*  on January 6th with the federal government and the Department of Justice [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=189.16s)]
*  they were very aggressive in using videotape to identify who did what when. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=192.2s)]
*  The question is would the District Attorney and the NYPD and Columbia [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=196.16s)]
*  University have the same approach or would they have a different approach [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=199.72s)]
*  here with respect to these protesters and these people doing what they're [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=203.16s)]
*  doing right now? Yeah the ignorance of these protesters is put on display. I [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=206.28s)]
*  think in two striking examples. One, they don't know what the First Amendment is [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=210.76s)]
*  or in what situations it applies and many of them, Mark, don't even know what [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=215.96s)]
*  Palestinian authority is, what Palestine or what they define as Palestine is or [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=222.2s)]
*  where it is for that matter besides the obvious ignorance of ruining your future [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=227.39999999999998s)]
*  if you are a student getting suspended and you know all your hard work and [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=232.72s)]
*  effort up until this point going to naught. Want to switch gears? I asked [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=236.16s)]
*  Allison Esposito before whether she thought the National Guard should be [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=240.56s)]
*  brought in. She said at this point no because the NYPD is able to handle [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=243.6s)]
*  situations like this and that's fine. My question to you is not should the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=247.8s)]
*  National Guard be brought in but what's the legal standard that a governor or a [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=252.0s)]
*  president or somebody uses when they say this situation I think has gotten out of [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=256.8s)]
*  control we need the National Guard to rein it in? What's that legal standard? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=261.16s)]
*  What's the the approach that these individuals making these decisions have [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=265.44s)]
*  to take? Well I think we recently saw this Todd in New York City where [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=268.88s)]
*  governor, New York governor Kathy Hoke will decide to call in the National [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=274.2s)]
*  Guard from New York and deploy them throughout the New York City subways [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=278.56s)]
*  because of a rampant crime wave that was going on there. So certainly the [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=283.2s)]
*  governor would have authority to deploy the New York National Guard if if she [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=286.64s)]
*  felt that was appropriate. There are there are instances where the president [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=291.15999999999997s)]
*  can get involved but I'm not sure we're at that kind of level at all right now. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=295.2s)]
*  Really this to me at this moment Todd is really a local law enforcement issue [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=298.84s)]
*  with in conjunction with Columbia University because at the end of the if [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=304.52s)]
*  there is a victim here if there is a crime and there is a victim it arguably [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=308.4s)]
*  is Columbia University and their staff. So the first step is what is Columbia [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=313.08s)]
*  University gonna do? For example if Columbia University says we're fine with [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=317.88s)]
*  them taking over these buildings we're fine with them hanging out here we're [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=321.52s)]
*  fine with them if they want to stick around all summer and just live in these [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=325.08s)]
*  buildings well you don't have a you know then you don't even have trespass [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=328.72s)]
*  because they've been invited in and they're now there with the consent of [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=331.8s)]
*  the owner. As to whether or not that's what Columbia University is going to do [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=335.52000000000004s)]
*  here I don't know I know what I would do which is I would want them to be kicked [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=338.68s)]
*  out of my private property and I would want them out of my institution because [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=343.68s)]
*  they're not following the rules of the First Amendment they're doing they're [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=347.32000000000005s)]
*  going far beyond that Todd but as to what Columbia University does that is hard to [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=350.24s)]
*  say. One more on this Mark as a parent now I view everything through the lens [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=354.6s)]
*  of a parent so my kids are nowhere near university age but I'm thinking to [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=359.88s)]
*  myself if they were if they were in this situation how horrific it would be for [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=365.40000000000003s)]
*  them just trying to study for final exams. So question for you do students at [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=369.56s)]
*  this university who are basically being deprived of an education right now who [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=375.24s)]
*  are being deprived of what their parents and maybe they have been paying for do [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=380.1s)]
*  they have a cause of action against the school for allowing this to go this far [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=384.32s)]
*  and do they have a cause of action Mark against the protesters to the extent [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=389.04s)]
*  that we can identify them? Well of course you really can't have a cause of action [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=393.59999999999997s)]
*  if you have not suffered damages so the question would be Todd is whether or not [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=399.44s)]
*  any of these students have suffered damages now if they're able to take [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=403.36s)]
*  their exams and they're able to get their transcripts and they're able to [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=407.0s)]
*  move forward where their college degrees well it's not clear they would have [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=410.48s)]
*  suffered any damages certainly they will have suffered annoyances to the [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=413.8s)]
*  extent that people are making noise outside their dorm room at four in the [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=417.32s)]
*  morning that would certainly violate even the basic First Amendment time [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=420.56s)]
*  manner and place restrictions which is I have the right to speak my mind but I [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=423.76s)]
*  don't have a right to speak my mind at three in the morning outside your home [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=427.32s)]
*  with a bullhorn and keep you up all night so yeah I think it would be a [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=430.16s)]
*  stretch to say they'd have a cause of action because they probably don't have [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=433.36s)]
*  any damages but certainly if someone is pushed or something bad happens to them [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=437.56s)]
*  yeah there's possibly a cause of action but at the end of the day I think [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=441.36s)]
*  proving damages would be the hard part of that and I would just say one [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=443.88s)]
*  additional thing Todd you know colleges are supposed to be places of learning [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=447.92s)]
*  well if there's students participating in this and they get in trouble with the [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=451.12s)]
*  criminal justice system by virtue of their conduct I think that will be a [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=454.52s)]
*  very important life lesson for them to learn that you know free speech sometimes [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=457.56s)]
*  at least the consequences thereof is not always free. An important point to make [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=462.56s)]
*  that these students clearly do not seem to understand. Want to get your thoughts [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=467.08s)]
*  obviously on the other big thing happening in New York City today the New [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=470.92s)]
*  York versus Trump trial continuing this morning with more witness testimony [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=474.96000000000004s)]
*  second hearing day a hearing day set for Thursday on the gag order let's focus on [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=478.12s)]
*  the testimony whether it's Pecker last week or Gary Farrow for this week isn't [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=485.8s)]
*  this all an attempt by the prosecution to really set up and establish the [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=490.56s)]
*  foundation for the Michael testimony that is sure to be the barn burner in [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=495.08000000000004s)]
*  this case? Yeah the way to understand trials is they really are a version of [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=499.2s)]
*  storytelling the district attorney has a particular story to tell the defense [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=505.4s)]
*  has a particular story to tell so what we've seen so far Todd is that the [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=509.36s)]
*  district attorney is trying to set the stage for the main actors and that's why [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=513.72s)]
*  we're seeing the testimony of David Pecker here about the kitchen the about [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=518.24s)]
*  sort of the catch-and-kill program that they allegedly had now we're seeing [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=522.64s)]
*  testimony from bankers about the financial transactions here and keep in [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=526.24s)]
*  mind a big part of what's going on here is the district attorney's theory is [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=529.92s)]
*  that there was a reality of these financial transactions and the reality [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=533.6s)]
*  of what these transactions were for and what they meant and how the money was [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=538.16s)]
*  used was different in some way than what was recorded in the financial records in [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=541.16s)]
*  the bookkeeping records so they have to show there's a difference between the [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=545.76s)]
*  realities the financial transaction on the one hand against the record-keeping [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=549.12s)]
*  of those transactions on the other hand just show there's a disconnect or some [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=552.84s)]
*  falsity that's the whole premise here and then of course they have to argue at [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=556.5600000000001s)]
*  some point the consequences of that and the intent behind all that and presumably [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=560.32s)]
*  that's what a witness like a Michael Cohen might conceivably be testifying [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=564.0s)]
*  about we don't know until he takes the stand but right now I think that the [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=567.12s)]
*  district attorney is trying to set the stage and at some point they have to [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=570.52s)]
*  bring in the main actors to explain why this is problematic under the law but I [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=573.96s)]
*  also think they know that those main actors specifically Michael Cohen are [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=577.84s)]
*  going to get annihilated on cross-examination by Trump's defense team [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=581.52s)]
*  and so they were setting it up early with what I consider to be a pretty [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=586.68s)]
*  sympathetic witness somewhat in David Pecker you know nobody was going after [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=590.76s)]
*  him on either side there were some attempts to attack his memory of certain [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=595.16s)]
*  situations but generally I think the prosecution did what it wanted to do [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=598.52s)]
*  setting the stage before all hell breaks loose when Michael Cohen takes the stand [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Z4D13b_bE&t=602.4399999999999s)]
