# ‘NEWSFLASH’: Biden’s ballot absence is the first ‘crack in the egg,’ NH gov. says
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw)
*  Governor Sununu, welcome back. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=0.0s)]
*  Hey, Brian, how we doing, buddy? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=2.72s)]
*  Good. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=4.04s)]
*  What do you think the secretary of state is going to say to Benjamin Netanyahu? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=4.44s)]
*  Why do you think he's rushing over to Israel? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=7.96s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I get the sense that it is to try to put the brakes on, on some of [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=10.8s)]
*  the aggression, so to say, but that's not going to happen. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  I'm not even saying it really should happen. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  I mean, Israel was absolutely attacked. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  This is a, this isn't a dispute over territory or anything like that. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=24.28s)]
*  This is a group, these Hamas killers want to literally wipe out every Jew on the planet. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=28.0s)]
*  I mean, that's their goal. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=33.28s)]
*  They want the second Holocaust. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=34.12s)]
*  So to go in and then tell just the leader of the Jew of the Israeli state back off a [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=35.44s)]
*  little bit, that's, that's not going to go very well. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=40.92s)]
*  And unfortunately, we haven't shown strength across the world in a systematic way. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=43.6s)]
*  We, we don't always back up our friends with this Biden administration. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=49.32s)]
*  So it comes from a, I think the argument would be coming from a place of weakness in [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=52.72s)]
*  itself. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=56.96s)]
*  So I just don't think that Yahoo is going to pay attention to so much that we have to [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=57.96s)]
*  say. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=61.76s)]
*  So are you surprised of Columbia University, Cornell, what we're seeing at NYU, we're [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=62.76s)]
*  seeing it at the, all the schools, at the California state schools, this sympathy towards [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=69.2s)]
*  Hamas to the Palestinians and condemnation of Israelis. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=75.52s)]
*  Is this surprise Governor Sununu? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=79.44s)]
*  It's a surprise to everybody, right? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  Because again, this isn't some sort of territorial dispute and even killed match here. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=84.52000000000001s)]
*  This is, these are killers that came in and we saw the brutality that they were willing [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=88.72s)]
*  to inflict, you know, on October 7th. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=92.92s)]
*  So I was asked to speak at Harvard about a week ago. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  I told them to go screw. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=98.04s)]
*  I said, no, we're not doing this because they're, they're, they're, they're kind of capitulation [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=99.04s)]
*  to these student groups who are on the side of absolute murderous killers. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  And that's what it is. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=109.68s)]
*  And now I'm a parent, I got a couple of kids and you know, that age and that kind of college [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=110.68s)]
*  age. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=114.4s)]
*  I don't just put it on the students. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=115.4s)]
*  We're the parents talking to their, to their, to their children that are part of these groups, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=116.4s)]
*  that are part of these, these demonstrations. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  These young adults are so, it isn't Republican Democrat here, guys. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  It is a progressive conservative. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=126.12s)]
*  They are just so off base in terms of what they think they're protesting about. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=127.80000000000001s)]
*  I don't even think they know and understand the issues at bear here. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=132.44s)]
*  They're just kind of going with whatever the progressives tell them to do. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=136.24s)]
*  They're going with that ultra progressive wing and it's dangerous. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=139.0s)]
*  It isn't just a, you know, we have a disagreement of philosophy here. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=142.4s)]
*  This is dangerous thinking where it is okay to now support a group of terrorists that [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=146.4s)]
*  are going to brutally murder, you know, not just innocent civilians, but our allies, our [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=151.68s)]
*  compatriots, people that have, you know, fought for the freedom of their own homeland. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  And that's okay. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=160.32s)]
*  Now this is nothing that I think anybody saw coming, but, and it's not just Harvard, it's [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=161.32s)]
*  not just Yale. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=165.32s)]
*  It's in real, it's really all across. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=166.32s)]
*  I mean, we see it a lot in the colleges, but it's everywhere. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=168.32s)]
*  By the way, we just have to tell you that the Rafah gate is open for injured Palestinians [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=171.56s)]
*  and for foreigners to get out. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=177.07999999999998s)]
*  So that's beginning to open up a little bit. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=178.62s)]
*  They should pressure Egypt to open up the gate for, for civilians and get the kids out [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=180.89999999999998s)]
*  of there because Hamas needs to be destroyed. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=184.92s)]
*  But governor, normally I ask you about the Republican race and I will, but first Democrats, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=187.64s)]
*  Dean Phillips is in and he wants to be in the New Hampshire primary. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=191.07999999999998s)]
*  Joe Biden doesn't. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=196.35999999999999s)]
*  And because he wants to be there, he is causing all types of unrest on the left. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  What is the situation? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=203.92s)]
*  Are you guys for the Democrats, the first primary? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=205.11999999999998s)]
*  Oh, we're the first primary. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=207.88s)]
*  There's no doubt about it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=209.76s)]
*  You know, Joe Biden tried to try to move the primary out of New Hampshire to South Carolina. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=211.51999999999998s)]
*  It didn't work. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=216.2s)]
*  The Iowa Democrats thought about trying to take it and put a primary in Iowa. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=217.56s)]
*  That didn't work. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  We're first. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=221.95999999999998s)]
*  We're going first. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=222.95999999999998s)]
*  That's all there is. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=223.95999999999998s)]
*  I think it's not on the ballot. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=225.0s)]
*  But here's the news flash for Joe Biden. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=226.32000000000002s)]
*  Nobody cares. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=228.88s)]
*  Nobody really cares that Joe Biden is not on the ballot here. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=229.88s)]
*  There's not some giant clamoring wing of the Democrat Party. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  I wish I could vote for Joe Biden in the New Hampshire primary. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=237.20000000000002s)]
*  We're there moving on. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=240.56s)]
*  They've given up on them. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=241.56s)]
*  They're moving on. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=242.56s)]
*  I think Dean Phillips has a huge opportunity here to just crack the Democrat Party wide [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=243.56s)]
*  open. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=247.68s)]
*  Now, that's going to happen whether it happens with Dean Phillips in New Hampshire, whether [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=248.68s)]
*  it happens at the convention or somewhere in between. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=252.28s)]
*  I've always been a believer that Biden likely isn't on that ballot come November of 24. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=254.48s)]
*  One way or another it's going to happen. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=260.04s)]
*  But this is the first serious crack in the egg. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=261.04s)]
*  Biden, whether he realizes what a gaffe he's made or not, there's a lot more important [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=263.64s)]
*  things he should be realizing, which he clearly doesn't. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=269.24s)]
*  I don't know how in tune he is to the situation, but there's a huge problem in the Democrat [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=272.32s)]
*  Party. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=276.72s)]
*  That fracturing is starting right here in New Hampshire. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=277.72s)]
*  To Dean Phillips' credit, he's going to work it the right way. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=279.72s)]
*  He's already got support from some of our legislators. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=282.6s)]
*  He's got support from individuals who used to support Biden. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=285.40000000000003s)]
*  He's going to go town to town and diner to diner. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=288.36s)]
*  He's got three, about three months here to really make a name for himself. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=290.36s)]
*  And that's more than enough time considering Biden isn't even on the ballot. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=294.0s)]
*  Well now all of a sudden you guys are getting ripped because there's too many white people [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=298.16s)]
*  in your state. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=301.16s)]
*  And that's not emblematic of the diverse Democratic Party. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=302.24s)]
*  You have heard that. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=306.76000000000005s)]
*  And now Phillips says that's the problem with the Democratic Party. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=308.12s)]
*  They're too divisive. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=311.44s)]
*  Just go win New Hampshire. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=312.56s)]
*  And now Clyburn's coming back at him. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=314.12s)]
*  And then he comes back and says he's disappointed in James Clyburn. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=316.4s)]
*  He should know better. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=319.04s)]
*  And now more people are coming back at Phillips. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=320.32s)]
*  Unwind this for me. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=322.68s)]
*  Yeah, so look, the idea that they were going to move the Democrat, first the nation primary [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=324.16s)]
*  to South Carolina because it had more representation of people of color. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=329.28s)]
*  But you forget one key point. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=334.15999999999997s)]
*  They don't vote. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=336.08s)]
*  And they basically have the party bosses tell everyone how to vote. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=337.52s)]
*  They have one of the lowest voter turnout in the entire country. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=341.91999999999996s)]
*  What's the point of having great representation if you're not allowing them to vote? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=345.08s)]
*  And there's still even a question, by the way, whether they hold the Democrat primary [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=350.28s)]
*  in South Carolina. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=355.32s)]
*  They may just give it to Biden. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=356.32s)]
*  They did that for Trump in 2020. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=357.76s)]
*  They may not even hold a primary there. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=360.03999999999996s)]
*  So they've really screwed this thing up. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=362.03999999999996s)]
*  They've caused a big mess. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=364.68s)]
*  In New Hampshire, we haven't changed a thing. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=366.36s)]
*  We're still going first. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=368.36s)]
*  This is where the arguments are going to be laid down with the individuals and the citizens. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=369.36s)]
*  And the media is here. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=374.12s)]
*  The attention is here. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=375.12s)]
*  And that's why Dean Phillips has a real shot and opportunity. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=376.48s)]
*  You have these party bosses, these elitists like Clyburn, who just think that, well, if [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=379.06s)]
*  you have my people that have my endorsement, you know, that's all that matters. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=383.28s)]
*  No, it's the citizens that matter. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=386.96s)]
*  It's the actual voters that matter, not these elitists in the Democrat Party. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=389.03999999999996s)]
*  And this is just a huge opportunity for the Democrat Party to kind of get back to basics, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=393.28s)]
*  do it the right way. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=397.35999999999996s)]
*  And God bless Dean Phillips. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=398.71999999999997s)]
*  He's leading the charge. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=399.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=400.71999999999997s)]
*  It turns out that Representative Benny Thompson, he of January 6th fame, says that Phillips' [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=401.71999999999997s)]
*  decision to go to New Hampshire is disrespectful to voters of color. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=407.76s)]
*  What? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=412.84s)]
*  What? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=413.84s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=414.84s)]
*  Like, I don't even have a response to that, Brian. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=415.84s)]
*  I'm not even sure what that means. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=419.71999999999997s)]
*  It sounds like people just, you know, yelling fire in a crowded theater. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=421.36s)]
*  It really does. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=424.08s)]
*  I'm just going to say something to scare everybody and put a negative light on Dean Phillips' [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=425.08s)]
*  campaign, even though, look, he's a super nice guy. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=429.59999999999997s)]
*  He's a very accomplished individual. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=431.96s)]
*  Don't agree with him politically on pretty much anything. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=433.52s)]
*  I'll give you that. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=436.04s)]
*  But he's going to run the race the way it should be run, person to person, asking for [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=437.84s)]
*  their vote, earning the vote, not just earning the approval of a couple of elites that will [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=442.56s)]
*  hand it to you when you really haven't earned it on the ground. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=447.88s)]
*  I mean, you remember Biden, he didn't engage in the press. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=450.40000000000003s)]
*  He campaigned from his basement. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=452.92s)]
*  He got his clock cleaned in New Hampshire back in 2020. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=454.52000000000004s)]
*  And that's what it needed. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=458.48s)]
*  He was lucky enough to have a party structure that didn't really listen to voters, only [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=460.24s)]
*  listen to elitists. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=464.64s)]
*  And that's how that's how we ultimately get the nomination. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=465.84000000000003s)]
*  Hopefully Democrats can smarten up and realize that they can't keep going down that path [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=468.28000000000003s)]
*  or that or they get, you know, out of touch millionaire old white guys that have no connection [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=472.6s)]
*  to the party base of the progressives. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=478.32s)]
*  So there's a huge opportunity on the Democrat side to kind of get back to basics. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=481.36s)]
*  On the Republican side, we're still doing our thing, right? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=485.24s)]
*  We're having an open primary. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=487.24s)]
*  There's still a lot of votes out there to be to be moved. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=488.76s)]
*  A lot of voters won't decide who they're voting for until, you know, maybe December or even [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=492.04s)]
*  January. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=496.28s)]
*  So there's still a lot of room for all the candidates to make a move here on Trump. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=497.28s)]
*  On a real clear average in New Hampshire, Trump's got forty six point three, Haley fourteen [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=500.76s)]
*  point eight to Santa's ten point five and Christie eight point five. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=507.03999999999996s)]
*  Is that what you're hearing on the ground? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=511.79999999999995s)]
*  That's about right. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=514.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's about right. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=515.4s)]
*  And I wouldn't expect it to move. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=516.4s)]
*  I won't expect those numbers to move until after Thanksgiving. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=518.3199999999999s)]
*  It depends on what happens. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=521.52s)]
*  I mean, remember, the third debate is going to be interesting, right? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=522.52s)]
*  Because there's going to be about half as many people on the stage. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=525.4s)]
*  They're going to have about twice as much air time. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=527.88s)]
*  It's going to be a little chipper than we've seen before. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=530.04s)]
*  And they got to they can't just keep repeating the same thing. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=533.84s)]
*  So they got to come with something new and exciting and a little bit inspirational. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=536.76s)]
*  So I think the third debate can be pretty pivotal. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=540.1999999999999s)]
*  I would see those poll numbers move until slightly after Thanksgiving. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=542.1999999999999s)]
*  That's typically when New Hampshire voters start getting down to business, talking to [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=545.8s)]
*  family members and and they start saying, OK, where are we going to go here? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=548.88s)]
*  And I think if someone can get the momentum, probably Haley or DeSantis, if one of [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=552.24s)]
*  those those two can get a lot of momentum and really search here, then you can start [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=556.16s)]
*  seeing a race where people start consolidating behind one of them and and moving [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=560.36s)]
*  forward. So you think on the stage, I know, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=564.0799999999999s)]
*  Tim Scott's having trouble qualifying for the next debate and Governor [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=566.52s)]
*  Bergram to you like him. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=569.84s)]
*  I know you guys are friends. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=571.36s)]
*  Governor Bergram to is having trouble qualifying. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=572.84s)]
*  Do you think it's going to be four? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=575.68s)]
*  I think it could be four. Yeah, four, maybe five. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=578.28s)]
*  Yep, I think so. And for all those folks, you know, three months ago, I said, well, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=580.48s)]
*  the field won't narrow itself down. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=584.16s)]
*  It just is right. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=586.0s)]
*  The RNC is actually doing, I think, a pretty good job, you know, making sure that [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=587.4399999999999s)]
*  we have a strong discussion on issues and not just getting 15 people, their five [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=591.48s)]
*  minutes of fame on a stage. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=597.36s)]
*  They're making it tougher to enter those debates. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=598.76s)]
*  I have no problem with that. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=600.8s)]
*  And as you said, these are all great candidates. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=602.24s)]
*  I mean, they're all great. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=604.28s)]
*  Some will qualify, some won't. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=605.52s)]
*  Some are hitting their marks, some aren't. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=606.8s)]
*  But they're all great. But ultimately, it really does have to be narrowed down. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=609.6s)]
*  And so if you get to four or five viable candidates by Iowa, New Hampshire, you [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=612.72s)]
*  start narrowing this down to one on one with Trump and somebody else before the [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=616.76s)]
*  first, before, you know, Super Tuesday. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=619.9599999999999s)]
*  Now you got a real race. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=622.12s)]
*  You really do. Now it's a 50-50 up for grabs. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=623.5999999999999s)]
*  And anyone with political momentum can feel this. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=626.16s)]
*  Right. And so far, have you changed your mind at all that Trump can't win? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=628.5999999999999s)]
*  In November? No. I mean, Biden's making it easier, but I don't think Biden's on [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=634.88s)]
*  the ticket. If I was sure Biden was on the ticket, I'd say, yeah, maybe Trump [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=638.8s)]
*  could actually beat that guy. It ain't going to be him, Brian. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=642.5999999999999s)]
*  It's not. They're going to give this to somebody else. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=645.16s)]
*  And the new fresh face, if you will, on a presidential ticket, he's going to get all [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=647.76s)]
*  the excitement in the world. You could have a horrible governor like Gavin Newsom, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=652.4s)]
*  as bad as that guy is at his job. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=656.04s)]
*  And there's not many that has ever been worse, maybe Cuomo. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=658.0799999999999s)]
*  He's terrible. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=660.52s)]
*  But he'll be a new face that hasn't been attacked and they'll be able to brush off [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=662.4399999999999s)]
*  some of the very clear arguments against him. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=667.3199999999999s)]
*  But it'll still be hard when he's going against someone like Trump. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=669.48s)]
*  He'll galvanize a lot of the independents on his side. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=673.68s)]
*  And that's just the reality Republicans have to face. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=676.16s)]
*  It does. You know what the issue of this campaign is? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=678.7199999999999s)]
*  It's not abortion. It's not the economy. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=681.24s)]
*  It's not jobs. It's winning. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=683.0s)]
*  Winning is the issue for Republicans in 2024. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=685.04s)]
*  So let's find any of these other candidates that we know can cross the line with the [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=688.16s)]
*  victory in November. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=691.48s)]
*  Because it's so dramatic. This country will look dramatically different if [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=692.8399999999999s)]
*  Republicans don't win. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=695.68s)]
*  And please try to tell me how the policies of the previous four years weren't better [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=697.04s)]
*  than these. I don't know if anyone can make that argument. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=701.1999999999999s)]
*  Lastly, you know the electoral process beyond New Hampshire. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=704.64s)]
*  What is too late? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=708.48s)]
*  When is too late to change the horse in the race? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=709.68s)]
*  I think Super Tuesday. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=713.28s)]
*  I think if it's not, it could be a 50-50. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=714.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think that that can be a 50-50 gambit between Trump and somebody else. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=717.56s)]
*  We have a shot. If Trump just runs the table on Super Tuesday, that's it. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=721.28s)]
*  It's toast. I mean, no, no, no. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=724.6s)]
*  I'm talking about Republicans. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=726.12s)]
*  When when the Democrats have to make a decision on whether Biden's going to be out. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=727.1999999999999s)]
*  No, see, I think Biden himself, Joe Biden and Biden himself, could make that decision [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=732.04s)]
*  going into the convention. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=737.12s)]
*  Yeah, see, they may give it up. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=738.8s)]
*  They may actually give it up, but they'll give it up to who they want. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=741.28s)]
*  They'll be kingmakers, if you will. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=743.8s)]
*  Right. So we're going to tell all of our delegates that we've earned in the primary [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=745.4s)]
*  process to go here and here. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=748.72s)]
*  And therefore, not only are they not in office anymore, they've gone out, people [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=750.8s)]
*  thank them, and they get to be kingmakers for the next generation of Democrats. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=754.52s)]
*  That's a that's a very interesting probability. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=758.0s)]
*  Governor, it's a it's a scenario, but not one that's ever been done. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=760.32s)]
*  And it would mean you'd have to bypass Harris, who's awful. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=764.08s)]
*  60 Minutes Feature proved that again. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=767.5600000000001s)]
*  So I'm trying to make her look good. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=770.2s)]
*  So I've never heard that scenario where you go and give your delegates to somebody else. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=772.84s)]
*  Yeah. Well, look, I've never heard of a scenario where the you know, someone like [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=777.84s)]
*  that that is running against eight other contenders in the Republican primary [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=781.5600000000001s)]
*  doesn't get on the debate stage. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=784.9200000000001s)]
*  I've never heard a scenario where you have a literally a senile president [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=786.28s)]
*  who can't keep his words together yet still may become president again, or a scenario [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=791.4399999999999s)]
*  where the leading Republican candidate might end up in jail. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=796.04s)]
*  I mean, this is a year of never been done scenario. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=799.0s)]
*  So let's put it all on the table and have fun watching the show. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=802.64s)]

*  I likely January 23rd, but that is not the date. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=818.64s)]
*  I don't announce that the secretary of state will make a formal announcement soon. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OergpZsNRw&t=821.72s)]
