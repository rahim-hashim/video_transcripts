# Dozens of Yale protesters arrested amid violent anti-Israel protests
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM)
*  Free, free Palestine! Free, free, free Palestine! Free, free, free Palestine! [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=0.0s)]
*  Sea to the river! Palestine will live forever! Palestine will live forever! [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=8.94s)]
*  Applause [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=14.58s)]
*  Anti-Israel protests sweeping college campuses across our country, including at Yale University, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=23.580000000000002s)]
*  where police say they arrested 47 people just yesterday. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=29.38s)]
*  Jeremy Hunt is a former Army captain who attended Yale University. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=33.58s)]
*  He's with me on campus right now. Jeremy, great to have you as always. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=37.379999999999995s)]
*  And as someone who walked these campus buildings, who walked these campus walkways, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=40.58s)]
*  whose Yale Law School campus, no joke, is about 20 yards to my right, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=45.980000000000004s)]
*  what's your reaction to what you're seeing? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=51.18s)]
*  Well, I first just want to say, look, I mean, there are many people that might be watching what's going on [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=53.18s)]
*  and thinking, you know, this is just normal kind of campus craziness. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=57.98s)]
*  This is something that we should all just kind of expect. College students do crazy things. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=61.58s)]
*  That is not what we're seeing here. What we're seeing here is far, far worse than that. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=65.78s)]
*  And one thing that I learned being in classrooms with these students for three years [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=71.08s)]
*  is that they genuinely believe the nonsense that you've heard at these protests. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=75.78s)]
*  I mean, they truly believe that up is down and down is up. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=81.17999999999999s)]
*  They honestly believe that when you look at the atrocities and the mass rape and murder that happened on October 7th, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=85.48s)]
*  that it was somehow justified because they think that Israel is a so-called apartheid state. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=91.08s)]
*  I mean, so what's very concerning is that these folks are going to be using their Ivy League degrees [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=96.28s)]
*  to become leaders in academia, business, politics. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=101.98s)]
*  And the rest of us, we need to do everything we can to make sure they never get anywhere close to power [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=107.28s)]
*  because we know that they have such a distorted view of justice. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=112.78s)]
*  And it's one of the reasons why even at Veterans on Duty, we're always about having veteran leaders [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=116.88s)]
*  promoting folks who care about our Constitution, they care about their country, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=121.88s)]
*  making sure those folks have a shot in running for office, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=125.28s)]
*  because we don't want people at places like Yale actually coming into major institutions and leading our country. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=127.88s)]
*  It is dangerous. You know, it's funny is when I first got here, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=133.48s)]
*  I thought that I was going to build bridges and find common ground. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=137.08s)]
*  There is no common ground to be found with people who think that our Jewish brothers and sisters [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=142.08s)]
*  deserve what happened on October 7th. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=146.78s)]
*  The only way, the only way forward is to make sure we defeat them [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=148.78s)]
*  and that these folks have no chance of leading our country in the future. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=153.38000000000002s)]
*  Okay, but how? How do you want to see the Yale University leadership respond to what they saw yesterday [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=156.58s)]
*  and what potentially they could see today in the coming days? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=163.58s)]
*  Have a backbone. Arrest them. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=167.48000000000002s)]
*  Do not be, if you are going to get on campus and spout out openly, blatantly anti-Semitic remarks, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=170.08s)]
*  if you're going to be here saying horrible things about people who, by the way, are classmates, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=176.28s)]
*  that's the crazy thing about Yale is that you'll sit in a classroom with someone right next to them, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=181.08s)]
*  and the next day they're protesting you. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=186.08s)]
*  I mean, this should not be, this is not a hard leadership test, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=187.58s)]
*  this is not one of those tough decisions and you got to kind of figure out a way. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=191.48000000000002s)]
*  There's one solution, that is, make sure that these folks are no longer enrolled at the school, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=194.78s)]
*  if they're going to say horrible things about Jewish people. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=200.18s)]
*  And other thing to remember too is that what's ironic about this whole thing [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=203.18s)]
*  is that they really cared about peace in the Middle East and peace for the Palestinian people. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=206.68s)]
*  They would be out here protesting Hamas, not Israel. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=212.18s)]
*  I mean, there is one way to peace in the Middle East, and that is if Israel finishes this fight, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=215.18s)]
*  that is if they defeat Hamas, free the hostages, and free the Palestinian civilians [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=221.18s)]
*  from the grips of Hamas and the restored deterrents. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=226.68s)]
*  I mean, that's one of the reasons why that's on duty. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=229.18s)]
*  We supported the financial package to send financial aid over to our allies in the Middle East [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=231.18s)]
*  and Eastern Europe to make sure they have the resources they need to defeat those [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=236.68s)]
*  who want to defeat the United States. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=241.18s)]
*  What I can't wrap my head around, Jeremy, is schools like Yale, Columbia, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=243.68s)]
*  they are the bastions of DEI. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=248.18s)]
*  Think of all the money that went to DEI and is still going to DEI at these universities. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=251.68s)]
*  Yet, for some reason, that does not apply to our Jewish brothers and sisters, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=257.18s)]
*  but it does apply to Hamas terrorists. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=263.18s)]
*  Help me understand that. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=266.18s)]
*  I mean, we are seeing the results of decades of these DEI programs. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=267.68s)]
*  And what do we have? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=272.68s)]
*  We have a spirit of hate that is clearly embedded in a lot of these students [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=274.18s)]
*  and what they believe about each other, what they believe about people who think differently from them, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=279.18s)]
*  people who have different politics, people who are proud of their Jewish heritage, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=283.68s)]
*  who are proud to stand with Israel. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=288.18s)]
*  They hate those who think differently. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=289.68s)]
*  And so if that is the result of DEI, we need to make sure DEI has no place in any institution in this country again. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=292.18s)]
*  I understand that you said the individuals believe what they're doing. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=298.18s)]
*  They believe in these causes, despite how insane it seems to us. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=302.68s)]
*  But if they believe, why are they all wearing masks? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=307.68s)]
*  Because quite frankly, I don't see a lot of COVID floating around here. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=310.68s)]
*  That is one of the most perplexing things I've tried to figure out for three years. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=314.68s)]
*  Why are people still obsessed with these masks? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=317.68s)]
*  I don't know. You're outside. I trust that we're okay here. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=320.68s)]
*  But my question is, are they embarrassed? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=324.68s)]
*  Even though they're proud of their belief, are they somehow embarrassed and they don't want the world to see? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=327.68s)]
*  Maybe for some of them, but I honestly think the far majority of them, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=331.68s)]
*  what's really disturbing is that they are not here because of peer pressure. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=335.68s)]
*  They aren't here because they think this is just kind of a cool fad to be a part of and they want acceptance. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=338.68s)]
*  They genuinely believe that what they are standing on is actually the right thing. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=344.68s)]
*  And that's what's so disturbing is that they are totally bass-ackwards in the way they approach everything in our culture. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=348.68s)]
*  And so they wear the masks. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=356.68s)]
*  Other times, they have their little theories floating around about why they do that. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=358.68s)]
*  I won't get on that. But I'll just say it's not something that... [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=361.68s)]
*  They're proud of what they believe and they stand on it. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=365.68s)]
*  It has to be extremely difficult for you as a veteran to experience that. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=367.68s)]
*  It's tough for just Americans to see what's going on and say, is this our country right now? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=371.68s)]
*  Jeremy, thank you for fighting for our country. We appreciate you doing that. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=376.68s)]
*  We appreciate your time this morning. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=379.68s)]
*  Thank you, Todd. Carly, over to you. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=381.68s)]
*  They are in full belief and some of them are chanting, we are Hamas. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=382.68s)]
*  Todd, Jeremy, thank you so much. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsALwuHpWM&t=386.68s)]
