# ‘WOKE VIRUS’: College kids are ‘marching for genocide’: Expert
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI)
*  Fox News alert you're looking live at London where a massive pro-Palestinian [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI&t=0.0s)]
*  rally is underway. Meanwhile back home one of the world's busiest train [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  stations Grand Central Terminal stormed by protesters calling for a ceasefire in [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI&t=9.84s)]
*  the Israel Hamas war. Another protest is expected in Brooklyn today. Let's bring [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  in New York Post columnist Carol Markowitz now for her reaction. Carol [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI&t=20.16s)]
*  let's start let's talk broad and then get more narrow maybe focusing on college [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI&t=23.76s)]
*  campuses right here in the US. What do you what is your big takeaway of seeing [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI&t=29.4s)]
*  this across the globe including by the way a vote on the floor of the UN but [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI&t=32.28s)]
*  streets across the globe filled with protests in support of Palestinians? I [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI&t=36.76s)]
*  think it's part of the same woke virus that has taken hold in so many places [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI&t=42.08s)]
*  looking for you know the oppressor versus the oppressed and that kind of [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI&t=47.0s)]
*  nonsense. The UN has never been pro-Israel it has never been you know [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI&t=51.08s)]
*  pro-Jew. I don't expect it to start now but I think that what is happening with [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI&t=55.04s)]
*  a lot of the young people marching is that they've been given this very basic [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI&t=59.28s)]
*  prism through which to see the world and they're looking at this conflict [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  through that prism despite the fact that Israel suffered such massive loss on [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI&t=68.84s)]
*  October 7th they've seen dead babies, kidnapped grandmothers, college kids [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI&t=73.08s)]
*  gotten gunned down at a music festival. All of that seems to not matter in the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI&t=77.88s)]
*  pursuit of some larger you know leftist goals. That is so that is absolutely [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI&t=82.12s)]
*  fascinating Carol. So what you've done is now you've brought it in tighter here to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI&t=86.84s)]
*  the universities in the United States and what we're seeing among young people. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  You know I think that one takeaway a lot of people have had Carol's wow you know [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI&t=92.64s)]
*  I didn't know a there was so much anti-Semitism and B there's so much [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI&t=97.2s)]
*  anti-Semitism on the left but I'm curious is anti-Semitism what you describe [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI&t=100.6s)]
*  happening on college campuses there certainly is anti-Semitism but I hear [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI&t=106.36s)]
*  you describing something else and that's the acceptance of this ideology to see [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI&t=109.56s)]
*  the world through the oppressor oppressed lens right and in this world [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI&t=113.08s)]
*  all these young people have decided well the Palestinians are the oppressed so [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI&t=118.52s)]
*  that's how you can hitch it to BLM and explain so many college campus rallies. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI&t=123.52s)]
*  That's absolutely right and you know just imagine if post 9-11 we saw at a [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI&t=128.76s)]
*  college campus like in Europe you know glory to the martyrs who did 9-11 you [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI&t=134.88s)]
*  would say wow that country has some problems but we're seeing this all over [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI&t=139.32s)]
*  America and I think that people need to be taking this a lot more seriously. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI&t=143.24s)]
*  These college kids are literally marching for genocide saying from the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI&t=146.84s)]
*  river to the sea Palestine we free which is the removal of Israel and they don't [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI&t=152.4s)]
*  just mean change the names keep the Jews they mean get rid of all the Jews in [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI&t=156.0s)]
*  that region. I think that people need to take it really seriously you know we've [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI&t=159.24s)]
*  seen again this woke virus go you know travel through our culture last few [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI&t=163.6s)]
*  years take control of corporations and colleges it's a very serious problem [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI&t=167.72s)]
*  that they're excusing now you know mass murder. It is it's extremely concerning. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYJ7FrW_AJI&t=172.12s)]
