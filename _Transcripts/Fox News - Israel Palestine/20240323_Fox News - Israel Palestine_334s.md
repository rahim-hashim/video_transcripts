# Former Israeli PM says Netanyahu has got to go as 'soon as possible'
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [March 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus)
*  With us now is Eheor Omer Adhi, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=0.0s)]
*  he is the former Israeli prime minister. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=1.8s)]
*  Prime minister, thank you very much. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=4.1s)]
*  How do you feel about this potential Ra'aqa invasion? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=5.74s)]
*  I'm not sure that I'm very happy about it. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=11.98s)]
*  I think that by and large, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=14.68s)]
*  we can say that we have won this war. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=16.62s)]
*  We have defeated Hamas, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=18.88s)]
*  we have destroyed the military capacity of Hamas, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=20.18s)]
*  we have killed more than 10,000 of its fighters, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=24.7s)]
*  perhaps more. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=27.8s)]
*  We have destroyed all the bunkers, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=29.78s)]
*  all the infrastructure, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=31.380000000000003s)]
*  all the most of the tunnels, almost everywhere. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=33.08s)]
*  And I'm not certain that the additional invasion of Ra'aqa, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=37.56s)]
*  considering the circumstances [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=42.42s)]
*  and particularly the fact that there are so many civilians [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=44.260000000000005s)]
*  that were pushed from the north part into Ra'aqa by us, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=49.0s)]
*  that will be now in the middle of this possible invasion. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=53.980000000000004s)]
*  This is something that can add a dramatic advantage [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=58.7s)]
*  to the achievements that we already have gained [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=63.84s)]
*  in this military confrontation. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=67.34s)]
*  So I think that by and large, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=70.02s)]
*  considering all the circumstances, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=71.78s)]
*  I'm not certain that this is the best strategy [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=74.12s)]
*  for Israel at this point. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=77.12s)]
*  What we have to do is to be even better. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=78.86s)]
*  But are you saying, prime minister, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=80.5s)]
*  I'm sorry, sir, that Israel's already won, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=82.1s)]
*  Hamas has been defeated, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=84.8s)]
*  there's no need to continue? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=86.16s)]
*  That there is not a dramatic need [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=89.10000000000001s)]
*  that outweighs the possible ramifications [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=92.74000000000001s)]
*  for the fate of the hostages? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=96.98s)]
*  We have to bring back the hostages. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=98.74000000000001s)]
*  There are 134 Israeli hostages kept by Hamas. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=100.28s)]
*  And I'm afraid that if we will continue [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=105.78s)]
*  the military operation in Ra'aqa, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=109.52000000000001s)]
*  we will not see any of them alive. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=113.56s)]
*  And when I think about the possible advantages [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=116.72s)]
*  of this additional military operation in Hamas, in Ra'aqa, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=120.16s)]
*  in comparison to the possible loss of the lives [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=125.0s)]
*  of so many of the hostages, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=127.3s)]
*  I think that we should prefer the lives of the hostages [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=129.2s)]
*  at this point. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=132.0s)]
*  Do you think Benjamin Netanyahu then has gone too far? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=133.88s)]
*  There's been a call by Chuck Schumer in this country, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=137.08s)]
*  others agree, there should be elections. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=139.18s)]
*  Now, some took offense to that, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  including many of your top government officials, sir, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=144.3s)]
*  but how do you feel about that? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=146.96s)]
*  You know, I can't hide my opinion. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=148.44s)]
*  It's been spelled out time and again in Israel [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=152.38s)]
*  and everywhere else. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=156.54s)]
*  I think that Netanyahu has to go as soon as possible. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=158.64s)]
*  We have to have elections as soon as possible. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=162.52s)]
*  And I can entirely subscribe to the opinion [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=166.68s)]
*  voiced by Chuck Schumer. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=169.62s)]
*  I know Chuck Schumer very well. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=171.66s)]
*  He's a great friend of Israel. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=173.54000000000002s)]
*  He's not a political opponent of Netanyahu. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=175.18s)]
*  He's a supporter, a devoted supporter [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=177.5s)]
*  of the state of Israel. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=180.38000000000002s)]
*  And I think he expressed the opinion and the attitude [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=181.38000000000002s)]
*  and the emotions that is shared [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=184.9s)]
*  by a majority of the Israelis. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=187.98000000000002s)]
*  Let's face it, there are polls almost every day in Israel [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=190.3s)]
*  now for the last few months. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=195.02s)]
*  And consistently in all the polls, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=197.84s)]
*  the majority of the Israelis do not trust Netanyahu [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=199.88s)]
*  and they want his replacement. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=202.9s)]
*  And I think that this is something that, you know, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=204.42s)]
*  I don't believe that there was any democratic leader [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=206.94s)]
*  in any democratic country that would have been responsible [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=210.29999999999998s)]
*  for such a dramatic disaster and failure of his government. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=213.42s)]
*  But isn't it very different prime minister, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=218.94s)]
*  isn't it very different prime minister for, you know, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=220.62s)]
*  top senator in another nation to call for elections [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=225.24s)]
*  in a sovereign state? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=230.94s)]
*  No matter how you feel about that senator, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=232.14s)]
*  no matter how you feel about your strong views [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=233.7s)]
*  against Benjamin Netanyahu, do you find that extreme? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=236.42s)]
*  Do you worry that it will reverse? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=238.85999999999999s)]
*  It would be dangerous. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=241.66s)]
*  I'll tell you something. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=243.98s)]
*  Let's be honest. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=245.45999999999998s)]
*  You know, we don't hesitate to come [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=247.0s)]
*  to guys like Chuck Schumer and we did it [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=249.62s)]
*  all over the years consistently and asked their support [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=252.89999999999998s)]
*  and asked their commitment and asked their votes [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=256.46s)]
*  and asked their contributions and asked their involvement. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=259.1s)]
*  And then when they have a different opinion from ours, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=263.8s)]
*  we have to say to them, no, but you don't have a right [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=268.12s)]
*  to voice your opinion. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=271.12s)]
*  For someone that has been so devoted [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=272.64000000000004s)]
*  to the state of Israel as Chuck Schumer is, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=275.24s)]
*  all over all his career, there is no one [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=278.40000000000003s)]
*  in the history of the American Senate [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=283.44s)]
*  with a record greater and better than Chuck Schumer [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=285.28000000000003s)]
*  in voting for the state of Israel, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=289.9s)]
*  for the Israeli needs, Israeli security, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=291.06s)]
*  Israeli demands, Israeli expectations. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=293.74s)]
*  And suddenly when he says something which is not in line [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=296.9s)]
*  with Israeli point of view or the government point of view [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=299.94s)]
*  of a particular person in the government, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=303.38s)]
*  then suddenly he has no right to say, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=305.62s)]
*  listen, we live in a free society. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=308.1s)]
*  We live in a free environment of very close relations. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=309.98s)]
*  All right, Prime Minister, thank you very much. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=312.98s)]
*  Very, very strong views and I'm disrespecting you [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=317.0s)]
*  by coming to this heartbreak, but thank you, sir, very much. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIDgE-81aus&t=319.68s)]
