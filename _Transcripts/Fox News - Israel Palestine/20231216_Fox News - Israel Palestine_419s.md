# Gaza can never post a terror threat to Israelis again: Netanyahu spokesperson
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs)
*  Todd Heinrich back with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=0.0s)]
*  He is really Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesperson. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=1.12s)]
*  Todd, very good to have you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=4.16s)]
*  What do you make of this pressure? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=6.12s)]
*  It's coming more often and certainly more loudly [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=7.84s)]
*  from the White House. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=12.0s)]
*  And now this apparent slight divide certainly [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=12.88s)]
*  between those in the White House, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=15.88s)]
*  some who back Israel nonstop and others who say, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=17.64s)]
*  well, maybe we should step back [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=20.88s)]
*  and see what they're doing to civilians. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  You've heard it all, but that pressure alone, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=24.68s)]
*  what do you think? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=27.32s)]
*  Thank you for having me on, Neil, from Israel now. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=29.240000000000002s)]
*  I've spoken to you many times from New York [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=32.28s)]
*  in the last weeks, and now I'm here. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=34.760000000000005s)]
*  It's a very difficult time for our country. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=37.160000000000004s)]
*  Very heavily charged atmosphere here, I can tell you. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  As for your question, there is, again, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  no daylight between Washington and Jerusalem [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=44.8s)]
*  and what pertains to the goals of this war. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=47.08s)]
*  We all believe that Hamas must be eliminated. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=49.88s)]
*  Israelis can no longer live next to a terrorist enclave. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=52.64s)]
*  And once Hamas is eliminated, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=55.56s)]
*  we don't want to see a resurgence of terrorism. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=57.559999999999995s)]
*  Gaza can never pose a terror threat to Israelis again. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=59.72s)]
*  We all want to see all hostages back in Israel. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=63.4s)]
*  And we all want to see the minimal civilians suffering [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=66.28s)]
*  in Gaza and civilian casualties in Gaza as we operate. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=70.08s)]
*  Now, I can tell you that as the IDF to move southwards [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=73.24s)]
*  to the next stage of this war, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=77.16s)]
*  operating in the area of communists, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=79.12s)]
*  and we see the population there evacuating [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=81.12s)]
*  to these safer zones that the IDF has designated, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=84.12s)]
*  we've seen a decrease in the number of civilian casualties. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=86.92s)]
*  This is the trend that we want to see. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=91.04s)]
*  Every civilian casualty is obviously a huge loss. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=93.12s)]
*  It's a tragedy. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=96.64s)]
*  It should not have happened. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=97.76s)]
*  But every civilian casualty, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=99.32000000000001s)]
*  Israeli and Palestinian, is on Hamas. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=101.0s)]
*  Let's just put it in perspective for a moment. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=104.08s)]
*  If Hamas had not perpetrated the October 7th massacre, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=106.08s)]
*  had they not stopped releasing hostages, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=109.64s)]
*  as per the outline that was agreed upon, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=114.32s)]
*  many of these people, all of these people, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=117.04s)]
*  would have still been alive today. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  There's no doubt about that. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=121.76s)]
*  But there is a pylon, or what appears to be a pylon, Tal, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=122.76s)]
*  and I was just sort of counting them this morning [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=126.52s)]
*  while I was getting ready for the show. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=128.6s)]
*  Who's been behind it? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=130.76s)]
*  You first of all, Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=131.88s)]
*  who said that Israel has to lower the intensity in the Gaza. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=135.4s)]
*  It's as simple as that. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=139.12s)]
*  Anthony Blinken, the former, not the former, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=140.52s)]
*  in his visit to Israel a couple of weeks ago, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=142.95999999999998s)]
*  talked about making sure that Israel is not over-responding, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=145.16s)]
*  over-reacting from the president himself, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=152.0s)]
*  divide about protecting average citizens [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=154.67999999999998s)]
*  and that they don't come in harm's way. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=158.56s)]
*  Has any of this built to the point, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=161.23999999999998s)]
*  on top of now Kamala Harris saying that we've got to be [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=163.56s)]
*  looking after the fate of Palestinians, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=167.11999999999998s)]
*  as if to say that we've been paying too much attention [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=169.79999999999998s)]
*  to the fate of Israelis? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=172.88s)]
*  Is that weighing on the government, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=174.35999999999999s)]
*  and is that lecturing about how to proceed, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=175.92s)]
*  affecting how the government operates now? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=178.72s)]
*  Well, the way you're framing this, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=182.44s)]
*  it's a question of proportionality. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=183.96s)]
*  And proportionality during war, according to international law [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=185.84s)]
*  and according to the awareness, according to logic, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=190.84s)]
*  it's doing whatever it takes to achieve [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=197.72s)]
*  a legitimate military goal. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=200.56s)]
*  And the goal that we have defined after the October 7th [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=203.04000000000002s)]
*  massacre is more than legitimate. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=206.08s)]
*  This is the most just war that one could imagine [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=208.0s)]
*  as other wars throughout history that also had civilian casualties. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  But there is no stopwatch here. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=215.12s)]
*  Really, Neil, we will complete this mission [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=217.32000000000002s)]
*  because at the end of the day, Hamas must be gone. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=219.72s)]
*  We don't want a band-aid solution here. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=222.28s)]
*  Simply not. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=224.72s)]
*  But I understand that part of it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=225.4s)]
*  Because then you and I will just have this conversation again. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=226.32000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I apologize for jumping on you there. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=228.24s)]
*  I'm just curious, if it ever came to the United States [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=231.08s)]
*  saying you keep doing this, you keep ignoring [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=234.28s)]
*  what we're hinting at and telling you to do, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=237.60000000000002s)]
*  we might pull aid or not offer as much aid. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=241.88000000000002s)]
*  It hasn't come to that. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=246.32000000000002s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=247.56s)]
*  I'm not making a mountain out of a molehill. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=248.52s)]
*  But what would Israel's response be to something like that? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=250.4s)]
*  I think you heard National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=254.92000000000002s)]
*  when he was here and Fox News also played some of the soundbites. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=258.04s)]
*  He also gave interviews to Israeli media outlets, by the way, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=261.44s)]
*  to deliver this message to the Israeli public directly. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=264.84000000000003s)]
*  And you really see that there is no daylight, as I stated, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=268.64000000000004s)]
*  between Jerusalem and Washington here. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=271.76000000000005s)]
*  We all want the same. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=275.20000000000005s)]
*  We want Israelis to be secure. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=276.76s)]
*  We want Palestinian civilians to not to suffer to the extent possible [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=278.40000000000003s)]
*  because Hamas has dragged us into this war. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=283.16s)]
*  As you know, nobody but Hamas wanted this war, nobody but Hamas. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=285.8s)]
*  And that's why we're operating in Gaza right now. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=289.56s)]
*  But there is daylight, right? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=293.47999999999996s)]
*  I mean, you can't deny that there's obviously daylight here. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=295.47999999999996s)]
*  Now, obviously, you're the ones fighting the good fight. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=298.24s)]
*  And I'm just wondering on any level does this lecturing [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=300.84s)]
*  and by the way, not just from the United States, you've heard it from the UN. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=305.64s)]
*  That's to be expected. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=308.68s)]
*  And that's been virtually nonstop. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=309.71999999999997s)]
*  But now from a lot of normal friends who are telling you, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=311.4s)]
*  Israel, cool it. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=315.40000000000003s)]
*  That that that that's daylight there. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=316.56s)]
*  Well, you see, you say the the the phrase normal friends, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=319.6s)]
*  but the United States, you are our best friends. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=323.32000000000005s)]
*  It's the White House. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=326.16s)]
*  We're leading and we're leading those discussions. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=327.16s)]
*  We're the ones saying it. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=329.76000000000005s)]
*  We're the ones lecturing. Right. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=330.88000000000005s)]
*  So we take advice from friends, more so from our best friends, of course. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=333.28000000000003s)]
*  And I think that the American people, they really know [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=337.04s)]
*  that Israel is fighting the pure evil called Hamas right here. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=340.6s)]
*  And they know how to tell right from wrong and good from evil. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RlhuAApNJs&t=344.44s)]
