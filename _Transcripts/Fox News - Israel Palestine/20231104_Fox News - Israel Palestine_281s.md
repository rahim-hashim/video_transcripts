# Netanyahu spokeswoman: There is ‘no daylight’ between the US and Israel
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA)
*  Thanks, Griff. Back to our top story now. For more on the latest from Israel, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=0.0s)]
*  we're joined by spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  Tal Heinrich. Tal, thank you so much for being here. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=8.24s)]
*  The first thing I wanted to discuss with you is, if Fox News has confirmed the New York Times [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=11.68s)]
*  reporting that part of the slowdown of getting some of these foreigners evacuated out of Gaza [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=15.44s)]
*  is that Hamas, it was discovered, was actually trying to sneak in Hamas fighters under the guise [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=23.44s)]
*  of being the wounded Palestinians. What is the prime minister's response to this? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=28.8s)]
*  Well, we know that this method has been tried in the past by Hamas. And by the way, it's not only [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=34.0s)]
*  us saying it. Even the Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas invoked that method in [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=40.0s)]
*  one of his previous speeches in the past. So it's a known method. And for that reason, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=45.44s)]
*  we are monitoring every movement. And for that reason, the IDF is also targeting the terrorist [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=50.72s)]
*  movements once we lock in on them. And we have evidence that they are trying to move around the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=56.8s)]
*  Gaza Strip sometimes and, you know, cynical uses of vehicles as ambulances, serving as taxis, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=63.36s)]
*  in fact, for their murderous actions. So we are watching every movement. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=69.6s)]
*  Yeah. And it makes it ever more complicated. And President Biden, the Biden administration is calling [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=74.72s)]
*  for a humanitarian pause to help get hostages out. Prime Minister Netanyahu, as you have mentioned, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=78.88s)]
*  has rejected that. But this three hour window today, could that be interpreted that Israel is [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=84.08s)]
*  willing to pause if needed? Well, we are willing to pause. As we said, there will be a cessation [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=90.08s)]
*  of activity as we've had in the past. Excuse me. There's a racing flag here. Oh, so we've had a [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=97.44s)]
*  cessation of activity in the past when Hamas released two hostages, then two more hostages. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=105.44s)]
*  And we wanted to facilitate their exit from Gaza. And we said once they release more hostages, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=111.44s)]
*  it will happen again. And we're waiting to see it. We want to see all hostages being released. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=116.0s)]
*  And we're calling on Hamas to do so unconditionally and immediately. But in terms of a bigger [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=121.44s)]
*  ceasefire, it's not something that's even negotiable. We said that our goal is to eliminate [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=126.24s)]
*  the Hamas regime and to bring back the hostages home. How does Israel see the distinction between [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=131.12s)]
*  a humanitarian pause and a ceasefire? Again, a humanitarian pause is something that we are, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=137.6s)]
*  of course, willing to discuss once more hostages will be released from the Gaza Strip. We want to [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=144.96s)]
*  facilitate the safe exit of hostages once there will be something of this kind on the table. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=150.16s)]
*  Of course, you will hear about it and nobody but us will be more satisfied and thrilled once this [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=155.6s)]
*  happens. But right now, it's not something that we're really discussing. But in terms of humanitarian [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=160.72s)]
*  aid, it is something that both Jerusalem and Washington obviously want to see the civilian [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=166.48s)]
*  population in Gaza receiving. For that reason, we said that we will allow in humanitarian aid. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=172.32s)]
*  And dozens of trucks are coming in every day from the Rafah border crossing with Egypt to the safer [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=178.56s)]
*  havens that we have designated for the population in the south. So as you know, U.S. Secretary of [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=184.32s)]
*  State Antony Blinken meeting with Arab leaders in Jordan on the heels of his trip to Israel. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=190.39999999999998s)]
*  Axios is reporting that behind the scenes in Israel, Blinken emphasized the increasing [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=195.36s)]
*  pressure on the U.S. to push for humanitarian pause. From the report, quote, Blinken's message, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  according to one U.S. and two Israeli officials, was, quote, we don't want to stop you, but help [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=205.68s)]
*  us help you get more time. I understand that you're limited in what you can say on meetings, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=212.0s)]
*  but is there a concern that there could be daylight peeking through between U.S. and Israel? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=217.04000000000002s)]
*  There is no daylight between the U.S. and Israel. We are in lockstep with our American counterparts [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=223.52s)]
*  in terms of what pertains to the goals of this operation, which is to bring back the hostages, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  as I said, and also, of course, to eliminate the Hamas terrorist regime as a governance body in [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=233.28s)]
*  Gaza, as a terrible military wing terrorizing not only us, but also the population there. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=238.24s)]
*  Everyone wants to see humanitarian aid reaching the Palestinian civilians. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=243.36s)]
*  We are also discussing, by the way, with our partners the future for Gaza for the day after. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=248.56s)]
*  There are different contingencies that are being discussed right now. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=252.96s)]
*  We hope that once Hamas will be eliminated, this will make the population in Israel way more [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=256.88s)]
*  secured, of course, and bring safety to the residents of southern Israel, but also bring [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=264.72s)]
*  new opportunities for the Palestinian people should they choose differently and understand [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=270.0s)]
*  that terrorism is a dead end. Tal Heimrick, thank you so much for being here today and [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=274.64s)]
*  providing us with this update. Thank you. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hOjIrWDUtA&t=279.28s)]
