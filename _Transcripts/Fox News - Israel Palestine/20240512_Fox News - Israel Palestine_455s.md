# 'LOOKS HORRIBLE': Everybody in this is part of the Democrat machine, Republican says
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [May 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8)
*  Well, joining us now is Florida Senator Rick Scott. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=0.0s)]
*  And, Senator, very grateful for having you on today. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=3.44s)]
*  And as you heard there, the situation in Gaza at the moment is getting, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=5.92s)]
*  it's getting pretty harsh for the Palestinians. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=9.92s)]
*  But the big news this week is that President Biden is withholding weapons from Israel. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=12.4s)]
*  What message do you think that sends both to Israel [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  and also what message does that send to Hamas? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=20.8s)]
*  Well, first off, it's a horrible message for Israel. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=24.96s)]
*  I was over in Israel about six weeks ago. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=27.76s)]
*  I met with the prime minister and I met with Gallant, the minister of defense. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=29.44s)]
*  I met with IDF. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=32.64s)]
*  And they don't have a choice. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=34.24s)]
*  Hamas is, you know, the last battalions are in Ra'afah. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=37.52s)]
*  If they're going to destroy Hamas, which they have to do for any security, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=41.68s)]
*  they have to go in. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=45.52s)]
*  And they've said they're going to do everything they can to get the civilians out. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=46.56s)]
*  I went to Kaffar, also half a mile from Gaza. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=49.84s)]
*  I walked the same streets I was in in 2019. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=52.24s)]
*  Where today, 63 people were killed. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=55.28s)]
*  Babies were beheaded. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=57.36s)]
*  Girls were raped. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=58.96s)]
*  People were burned alive. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=60.0s)]
*  People were shot just point blank for being one thing, Jewish. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=61.28s)]
*  I went to the Nova Film Festival area and I talked to parents that lost their loved ones. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=64.48s)]
*  Israel has no choice but to destroy Ra'afah. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=69.44s)]
*  I've always believed that, you know, Biden is unfortunately [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=73.12s)]
*  now part of the pro-Hamas wing of his party. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=76.88s)]
*  That's all they're worried about is he's worried about winning the presidential election. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=79.2s)]
*  Thank God for President Trump. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=84.0s)]
*  He is one of the most pro-Israel presidents in our history. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=85.12s)]
*  And I hope he wins so we can get somebody in there that's going to support Israel. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=88.16s)]
*  This is, it's disgusting. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=92.32s)]
*  This, if money that goes to Gaza is going to Hamas, whether we like it or not, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=93.92s)]
*  it's not going to the Gazans. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=98.88s)]
*  It's going to help Hamas. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=100.64s)]
*  Those tunnels were built with money from America. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  Those missiles are rockets that were sent into Israel. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=104.88s)]
*  That's money for America. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=107.75999999999999s)]
*  And I suppose, you know, one of the big news this week is that President Biden is withholding [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=109.92s)]
*  weapons from Israel. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=113.28s)]
*  But Republicans are heavily critical about this. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=115.12s)]
*  But you have to remember that Reagan did the same thing back in 1981. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=117.28s)]
*  The New York Times saying this, saying, Mr. Reagan used the power of American arms [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=121.36s)]
*  several times to influence Israeli war policy at different points, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=126.0s)]
*  ordering warplanes and cluster munitions to be delayed or withheld. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=129.68s)]
*  So what do you make of that? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=133.12s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure you were a fan of President Reagan, but how do you explain the difference [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=135.28s)]
*  from what happened in 1981 and what President Biden is doing today? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=138.56s)]
*  Well, we have to live in reality. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=143.28s)]
*  Today, here's what we know. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=145.04s)]
*  The last battalions of Hamas are primarily in Ra'afah. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=150.08s)]
*  Israel has no choice but to destroy Hamas. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=150.88000000000002s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=153.76000000000002s)]
*  Egypt, unfortunately, won't open up their borders to let the Palestinians or the Gazans [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=154.72000000000003s)]
*  come in. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  I mean, that's frustrating that that's not happening. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  I don't know why Biden is doing nothing to force Egypt to open up their borders. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=160.96s)]
*  So the civilians, if he was worried about the civilians in Gaza, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=165.44s)]
*  get Egypt to open their borders and let them come in. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=168.56s)]
*  But this idea that we are not going to support Israel's ability to destroy Hamas, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=171.28s)]
*  and how do you ever live in any peace in Israel? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=177.44s)]
*  And by the way, we still have eight American hostages. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=183.12s)]
*  Why doesn't Biden even talk about these hostages? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=186.4s)]
*  I mean, we have eight Americans. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=189.68s)]
*  We have over 30 Americans that were killed. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=190.96s)]
*  You hardly ever hear anything out of Biden's mouth. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=193.6s)]
*  Today, where we are today is Israel needs our support. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=196.48s)]
*  They've got to destroy Hamas. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=200.95999999999998s)]
*  Hamas is in Ra'afah. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=203.28s)]
*  So the civilians need to leave. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=204.72s)]
*  That's what Israel is trying to do. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=206.32s)]
*  They're doing everything they can to keep civilians safe. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=207.51999999999998s)]
*  But it is interesting. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=210.32s)]
*  That's a commitment they've always made to me. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=211.28s)]
*  It is interesting that President Biden is doing something that President Reagan did in 81, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=213.04s)]
*  and yet he has been criticized for it. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=216.56s)]
*  So I'd like to move on to President Trump's court case at the moment. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=218.32s)]
*  But I mean, it's interesting to see how both sides did that. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=223.92s)]
*  President Trump was in court recently, and you were there as well, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=227.2s)]
*  at his alleged hush money trial. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=230.95999999999998s)]
*  And speaking afterwards, you came out, you spoke, and you attacked the judge's daughter, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=233.04s)]
*  the prosecutor's wife, something the former president [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=238.48s)]
*  has prohibited from doing himself under a gag order. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=241.04s)]
*  And I suppose, why did you decide to join the president this week in court [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=243.12s)]
*  and then purposely go after the judge's family? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=247.2s)]
*  Well, number one is President Trump is a friend. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=252.16s)]
*  I've known him for a long time, even before I was Florida's governor. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=255.44s)]
*  I mean, this is ridiculous what's going on. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=260.0s)]
*  The Democrats are using the court system to go after and prosecute criminally [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=263.04s)]
*  a political opponent. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=267.12s)]
*  I mean, that's a crime. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=268.24s)]
*  This is wrong. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=269.28s)]
*  I mean, what the Democrats are doing, they're just thugs trying to stop Trump from being able [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=269.92s)]
*  to run for president. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=273.6s)]
*  I mean, this has happened to me. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=274.72s)]
*  It's happened to a lot of people. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=276.32s)]
*  But here's the deal. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=277.36s)]
*  Just think what this is. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=278.96s)]
*  The Justice Department, the Biden Justice Department, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=280.72s)]
*  they're number three person down to be the lead prosecutor. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=282.88s)]
*  Does that not sound bad? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=285.44s)]
*  His wife is a big donor, right? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=287.28000000000003s)]
*  The judge's daughter, the judge is a Democrat donor. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=289.84s)]
*  The judge's daughter is a big Democrat fundraiser. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=292.48s)]
*  Everybody involved in this, right, is part of the Democrat machine. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=295.44s)]
*  And so it's this, I mean, it just, it looks horrible what's going on here. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=300.48s)]
*  And so, and then they put a gag order on Trump in the middle of a presidential race. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=305.44s)]
*  I mean, all they're trying to do is make sure Trump can't go win the presidency. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=309.91999999999996s)]
*  Biden can't run on his record. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=315.03999999999996s)]
*  Trump's got a record. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=317.28s)]
*  The border was secure. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=318.4s)]
*  The economy, we're good and not at war. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=319.35999999999996s)]
*  Biden's record, the border is wide open. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=321.91999999999996s)]
*  Inflation is unbelievable. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=325.44s)]
*  And now we're at war around the world. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=327.12s)]
*  So what he's got, what Biden's got to try to do is try to silence Trump. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=328.88s)]
*  And that's what he's trying to do right now. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=333.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=335.52s)]
*  You were very vocal about certainly earlier this week. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=336.08s)]
*  I wanted to ask also about the campus protests that we're seeing across America at the moment. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=338.48s)]
*  You are taking part in an Israeli solidarity event, countering these encampments. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=342.40000000000003s)]
*  What do you make of these protests? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=348.16s)]
*  Also, what do you think that it says about the future of universities here, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=350.08000000000004s)]
*  perhaps also about the future of young Americans? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=353.36s)]
*  Well, first off, these university presidents are complacent in allowing people to spew hatred. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=358.64000000000004s)]
*  Picking one group of Jews to allow these individuals to come on their campus [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=364.71999999999997s)]
*  and be violent, trespass all these things without immediately saying that has to stop, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPG0MvOjdi8&t=371.28s)]
