# What’s next after Israel-Hamas temporary cease-fire?
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4EexRQWBM)
*  OK, we'll go to Trey Yanks' tease in southern Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4EexRQWBM&t=0.0s)]
*  And Trey, as Lucas just said, the president had some off-the-cuff, forceful words we just [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4EexRQWBM&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  heard. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4EexRQWBM&t=8.94s)]
*  And he did tout that bridge, as I said, between Saudi Arabia and America to have Israel walk [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4EexRQWBM&t=9.94s)]
*  over for a peace deal, in that he says that, I can't confirm it, but that is why he believes [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4EexRQWBM&t=17.0s)]
*  Hamas struck when they did. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4EexRQWBM&t=21.92s)]
*  Trey? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4EexRQWBM&t=24.6s)]
*  Yeah, Arthel, as President Biden was speaking at the Hatzarim airbase behind me, some of [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4EexRQWBM&t=26.6s)]
*  those hostages that were released back into Israeli custody were receiving medical treatment [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4EexRQWBM&t=34.28s)]
*  before heading on to hospitals in central Israel. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4EexRQWBM&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  It's important to note when you look at President Biden's comments, there is still a huge divide [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4EexRQWBM&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  in how the Americans see this moving forward and how the Israelis see this moving forward. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4EexRQWBM&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  President Biden there touting the diplomacy, and rightfully so. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4EexRQWBM&t=54.52s)]
*  The Qataris were able to cut a deal here between Israel and Hamas to get this first group of [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4EexRQWBM&t=57.800000000000004s)]
*  hostages out. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4EexRQWBM&t=62.080000000000005s)]
*  And if this goes forward as planned, you'll see a four-day ceasefire that will ultimately [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4EexRQWBM&t=63.080000000000005s)]
*  end in 50 hostages being released from Gaza in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4EexRQWBM&t=67.48s)]
*  being released by the Israelis. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4EexRQWBM&t=73.80000000000001s)]
*  What we should note here, though, is the question is not about this ceasefire. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4EexRQWBM&t=76.08s)]
*  The question is about what comes next. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4EexRQWBM&t=79.84s)]
*  The day after the ceasefire, what will that look like? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4EexRQWBM&t=81.6s)]
*  And the reality on the ground is that the idea of a long-term truce or the ability to [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4EexRQWBM&t=85.28s)]
*  have peace in the Middle East is a great idea in comment. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4EexRQWBM&t=90.44s)]
*  But in practice, it's quite difficult. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4EexRQWBM&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  And we saw this all play out over the past nearly 50 days. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4EexRQWBM&t=96.28s)]
*  And so this is really what we're looking at in the coming days and weeks, part of that [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4EexRQWBM&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  discussion and disagreement. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4EexRQWBM&t=103.28s)]
*  Arthel? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4EexRQWBM&t=104.63999999999999s)]
*  Trey Yanks, Southern Israel. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4EexRQWBM&t=105.63999999999999s)]
