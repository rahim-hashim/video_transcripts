# IDF confirms 16 Israeli troops killed in battles with Hamas militants in Gaza
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk)
*  We'll begin with Trey Yankst. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk&t=0.0s)]
*  He's live on the ground in southern Israel for us at this hour. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk&t=1.48s)]
*  Trey, we have an update from the IDF on how many troops have been killed in Gaza. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk&t=4.72s)]
*  What can you tell us? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk&t=10.52s)]
*  Yes, Andrew, good afternoon. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  We've just returned from the front line, that border between Israel and Gaza. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk&t=15.24s)]
*  And the Israelis tonight updating us that 16 of their soldiers were killed over the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk&t=19.72s)]
*  past two days during gun battles with Hamas militants inside the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk&t=25.04s)]
*  We could hear some of that fire along the border today, small arms and also the Israelis [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk&t=30.0s)]
*  using attack helicopters and air support to try to push those infantry troops deeper into [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk&t=34.32s)]
*  the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk&t=40.28s)]
*  The Israelis have released some new video of their forces operating inside Gaza. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk&t=41.28s)]
*  You can already see this is a street-to-street battle, a block-to-block fight that will be [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk&t=46.4s)]
*  incredibly difficult and is expected to take months. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk&t=51.4s)]
*  We talk about that air support. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk&t=54.88s)]
*  Yesterday, the Israelis targeted the Jabalia refugee camp in the northern part of the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk&t=56.120000000000005s)]
*  They say they killed Ibrahim Biyari, the battalion commander for Hamas in the northern part of Gaza, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk&t=62.64s)]
*  a significant target for the Israelis. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk&t=69.16s)]
*  But they are facing new questions today about the civilian casualties in that strike as [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk&t=71.16s)]
*  they continue to gather more information about exactly how many people died. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk&t=76.04s)]
*  Now, amid these tragic updates on both sides of the border, we do want to take you to that [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk&t=80.12s)]
*  Ra'afa crossing the border between Egypt and Gaza, where we do have some good news to report. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk&t=84.36s)]
*  After weeks of negotiations, the Qataris were able to cut a deal between Hamas, Israel and Egypt [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk&t=89.64s)]
*  to allow 335 foreign nationals to leave today, along with 76 injured Palestinians who are in [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk&t=95.88s)]
*  desperate need of medical attention. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk&t=102.68s)]
*  We do expect those numbers to rise in the coming days as the crossing is expected to remain open. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk&t=104.6s)]
*  Sandra? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk&t=109.8s)]
*  Trey, what can you tell us about those Americans trying to get out? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk&t=110.8s)]
*  We know there are hundreds of American citizens trying to get out. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk&t=114.36s)]
*  We do expect to get some more specific numbers from the State Department momentarily. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk&t=118.92s)]
*  But we should note not all Americans were able to make it out of the Gaza Strip today, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk&t=123.64s)]
*  and we know that because we are talking with U.S. citizens inside Gaza. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk&t=127.4s)]
*  I spoke with one woman who I've been in touch with for the past several weeks. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk&t=131.0s)]
*  She said her son was on the list to leave today because he also has a Jordanian passport, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk&t=134.28s)]
*  but she was not on the list. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk&t=139.16s)]
*  This is a family from Utah, and they are looking to get back to the United States. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk&t=140.52s)]
*  They've been trapped inside Gaza since that massacre in southern Israel on October 7th. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk&t=144.12s)]
*  Sandra? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk&t=149.08s)]
*  Trey Yanks, they're in southern Israel for us at this hour. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk&t=149.56s)]
*  Trey, thank you. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQGEzIYc2rk&t=152.04s)]
