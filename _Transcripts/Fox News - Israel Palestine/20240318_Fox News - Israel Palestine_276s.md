# Jack Keane: The Biden admin should have stayed out of this
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [March 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U)
*  In the meantime, from overnight now, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=0.0s)]
*  the IDF Israeli Defense Forces moving [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=1.68s)]
*  in on Gaza City on a hospital there. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=3.46s)]
*  When I show you the map behind me, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  everything you see in blue is areas [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=7.68s)]
*  that have been cleared item on [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=9.48s)]
*  behalf of the Israeli military. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=11.16s)]
*  The area in Brown is an area that [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=12.76s)]
*  has not yet been touched or gone [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=14.72s)]
*  through during the current war. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=16.72s)]
*  This yellow road here that [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=18.2s)]
*  intersects all of Gaza City said [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=19.68s)]
*  to be a humanitarian corridor. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=21.44s)]
*  So too this sector right here along [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  the the Mediterranean Sea, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=25.2s)]
*  but the Oshifa Hospital is in Gaza City. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  Remember now all the action, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=29.52s)]
*  all the headlines, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=31.16s)]
*  all the news is pushing to the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=31.96s)]
*  southern end of Gaza toward this [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=33.84s)]
*  border crossing of Rafa, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=35.52s)]
*  but this action is up here in Gaza City. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=36.8s)]
*  Want to bring in General Jack [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  Keene to help explain that. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=40.88s)]
*  And Sir, good morning to you. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=42.24s)]
*  What is this all about? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=43.84s)]
*  As Israelis say, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=45.24s)]
*  they have found Hamas fighters [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=46.2s)]
*  inside that hospital. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=47.64s)]
*  Yeah, well, Bill, of course, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=50.28s)]
*  that Israelis conducted significant [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=52.040000000000006s)]
*  clearing operations in northern [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=53.56s)]
*  Gaza many many weeks ago, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=55.040000000000006s)]
*  but given the situation, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=56.64s)]
*  but given the scale of what [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=58.2s)]
*  they're dealing with, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=60.04s)]
*  it's impossible for them to occupy [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=60.84s)]
*  all the territory that they cleared [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=63.68s)]
*  out the Hamas fighters. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=66.36s)]
*  So what we have here is Hamas [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=68.64s)]
*  re infiltrating the Al-Shifa Hospital, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=71.12s)]
*  something the Israelis had been through [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=74.16s)]
*  and actually had occupied [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=76.4s)]
*  for a number of days, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=78.32s)]
*  if not weeks, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=79.4s)]
*  because of the complex tunnels [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=80.68s)]
*  that were underneath it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=83.48s)]
*  So it's not surprising [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=85.2s)]
*  that Hamas comes back [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=86.76s)]
*  and where they do it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=88.2s)]
*  Last week, up in the northern part of Gaza, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=89.64s)]
*  the IDF was going into a school, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  which obviously raises everybody's eyebrows. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=95.92s)]
*  Nobody wants a war being fought over a school. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=98.2s)]
*  Well, we don't want it being fought [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=100.28s)]
*  over a hospital either, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=102.48s)]
*  but Hamas chooses these sites purposely [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=103.80000000000001s)]
*  because they will shield them [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  from IDF operations. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=110.64s)]
*  And also it enhances [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=113.32000000000001s)]
*  international condemnation [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=116.56s)]
*  of what the Israelis are doing. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=118.28s)]
*  And that's what this is all about. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=120.2s)]
*  They'll clear these people out of that hospital, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=121.6s)]
*  but don't be surprised if there isn't some instances [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=124.44s)]
*  of more re infiltration [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=127.72s)]
*  in the northern part of Gaza, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=129.52s)]
*  despite the clearing operations [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=132.32s)]
*  that have taken place. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  Okay, well, we'll follow that. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=134.76s)]
*  I know you came out to talk about the military, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=135.88s)]
*  but there's a political equation in this as well. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=137.96s)]
*  When you think about Chuck Schumer's comments [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=140.52s)]
*  last week on the floor of the Senate [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=142.32s)]
*  talking about the Israelis losing their confidence [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=143.68s)]
*  in Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=146.84s)]
*  urging them to hold a new election soon. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=148.48s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu was on Fox and Friends [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=151.6s)]
*  on Sunday morning and said this. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=153.6s)]
*  I think Schumer's statements are wholly inappropriate. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=156.44s)]
*  I think we're not a banana republic. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=159.36s)]
*  The people of Israel will choose [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=161.32s)]
*  when they'll have elections. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=162.8s)]
*  I think the only thing that we should be focused on [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=164.0s)]
*  is changing the regime in Gaza, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=166.68s)]
*  bringing down the terrorist regime of Hamas [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=169.56s)]
*  and not the duly elected government of Israel. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=172.68s)]
*  That's the right policy. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=175.08s)]
*  General, I don't mean to put you in a pinch here, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=176.84s)]
*  but what do you think about how that fits into this war [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=179.04s)]
*  and the current equation and the relationship [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=182.4s)]
*  between Jerusalem and Washington? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=184.2s)]
*  Yeah, well, certainly this has got it [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=187.8s)]
*  into public spaces now. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=189.64000000000001s)]
*  I mean, we've known for many weeks [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=191.12s)]
*  that the administration disagreed with how the IDF [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=193.24s)]
*  and Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=197.16s)]
*  was conducting military operations, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=199.96s)]
*  something I think they should have stayed out of [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=201.79999999999998s)]
*  and left that up to the IDF and their national leadership. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=204.2s)]
*  And now we have Schumer actually calling for the removal [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=207.92s)]
*  of the prime minister by holding elections [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=211.84s)]
*  prior to the time they would likely have them themselves. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=215.04s)]
*  I think that's pretty shameful. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=218.0s)]
*  And this is a close ally of ours [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=219.76s)]
*  and actually doing something like that [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  plays right into the hands of the Hamas. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=223.96s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=226.68s)]
*  Because it gives them leverage [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=227.6s)]
*  in negotiations that have taken place. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=229.52s)]
*  It helps them in the international community [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=231.88s)]
*  with the condemnation of Israel [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=234.8s)]
*  because they believe now they have on their side [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=236.56s)]
*  the president's words that he has used, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=239.68s)]
*  now Senator Schumer's words, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=242.12s)]
*  the highest elected Jewish official [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=245.24s)]
*  in the United States government. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=247.76000000000002s)]
*  All of that will be used against the Israelis [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=249.0s)]
*  and the prime minister in negotiations [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=251.92000000000002s)]
*  and also to fan the condemnation of Israel worldwide. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=254.68s)]
*  General, thank you. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=258.92s)]
*  We'll see how it goes this week [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=259.76s)]
*  and we'll keep an eye on what's happening [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=260.92s)]
*  there in Gaza City. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=262.12s)]
*  Jack Keene, thank you for your time today. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnwlSxDO6U&t=263.04s)]
