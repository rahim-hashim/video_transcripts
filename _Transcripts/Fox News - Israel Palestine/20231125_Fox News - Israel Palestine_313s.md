# We are dealing with evil: Former Israeli UN ambassador
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck)
*  Israeli Knesset member and former Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=0.0s)]
*  with me now. Danny, great to see you. Thank you for being here. First and foremost, the condition [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=5.2s)]
*  of the hostages that have been released so far, particularly the children. How are they doing? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=10.48s)]
*  Thank you for having me, David. So we examined the hostages who arrived yesterday [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=17.84s)]
*  and their physical condition relatively is good, but you can imagine the mental situation [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=23.04s)]
*  after almost 50 days in tunnels. You know, we have some elderly people who were without their [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=29.36s)]
*  medicines, so they will take the time. They met their families. They will take it day by day, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=34.96s)]
*  and we hope they will recover soon. And they are worried about the people who were staying behind [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=40.24s)]
*  in captivity. And also they had to learn about the news of people who died during the massacre [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  of October 7th. So for some of them, that was the first time they had to face very, very sad news. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=51.2s)]
*  Are you trying now to get the children out first? I would assume that's your priority. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=57.68s)]
*  Indeed. So the pause now, our main concern is to bring back the children and the mothers. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=65.12s)]
*  We hope that it will happen in the next few days. As you know, we have a lot of hostages in the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=70.64s)]
*  hands of Hamas, this vicious terrorist organization, and we are determined to do two things, to bring [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=77.36s)]
*  all of the hostages back to Israel and to destroy Hamas. Very simple. As long as it takes, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=82.88s)]
*  we are determined to do that. So now we are focusing on bringing the hostages, but after a [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=89.28s)]
*  few days, we will resume our military activities. We will go everywhere it's needed until we find [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=94.16s)]
*  the leadership and we'll eliminate Hamas. Danny, I got to ask you a personal, you're a diplomat, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=100.0s)]
*  and you're a very good one. We dealt with each other when you were here in New York. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  But how do you deal with monsters who kill and kidnap children? I mean, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=110.08s)]
*  just in terms of the diplomacy, how is it possible for you to practice diplomacy with these people? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=117.28s)]
*  It is very hard and we don't deal with them directly. We have a negotiator who are in the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=126.08000000000001s)]
*  middle, mainly Qatar and Egypt. And we know that we are dealing with evil, but because we have babies [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=131.20000000000002s)]
*  in captivity, because we have women, we do whatever we can to bring them back. But at the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=137.52s)]
*  same time, we remember the goal. And one of the generals which I met yesterday, he told me, Danny, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=143.20000000000002s)]
*  can you assure me that after the pause we will continue with the military operation? And I told [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=149.76000000000002s)]
*  him, I have no doubt. You have my word and the cabinet guarantees that we will continue with [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=155.12s)]
*  the military operation despite this pause. We are doing it in order to see those children back with [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=160.88s)]
*  their families. Well, how close are you to achieving your goal of wiping out Hamas? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=166.4s)]
*  Well, unfortunately, you know, we are not very close. We have a lot ahead of us because we [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=174.24s)]
*  operate very slowly in Gaza for two reasons. We want to minimize casualties for our forces [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=178.88s)]
*  and for the civilians. That's why it took us a while to encourage the population to move to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=185.52s)]
*  the south and only then to maneuver with our ground operation. Same will be in the other [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=190.4s)]
*  areas of Gaza. We will try to convince the population to move out and then we're going to [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=196.08s)]
*  come after Hamas. We could have finished the job by now, but the number of casualties would have [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=200.4s)]
*  been very high. So I think that is the right approach to move slowly, cautiously, but to be [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=206.72s)]
*  determined to finish the job. You have been in wars with Hamas before and they have violated [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=212.16s)]
*  ceasefires. Any signs that they are doing so right now? So you're absolutely right. In 2014, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=217.84s)]
*  during a ceasefire, which was initiated by the UN, they kidnapped Israeli soldier, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=225.36s)]
*  Adar Goldin, and many times they broke the ceasefires. We have seen minor incidents. So [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=231.12s)]
*  as of now, we continue with the pause and I hope it will continue until Monday evening. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=237.44s)]
*  There's still a possibility for extension that it's up to both sides to decide about it. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=243.76000000000002s)]
*  And even though you have more work to do against Hamas, has enough damage been done so that [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=248.72s)]
*  once the pause is over, they may not be able to get back on their feet? Or is that too optimistic? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=255.52s)]
*  No, we have to go all the way. When I say all the way, if you look at the map of Gaza, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=263.2s)]
*  we are operating now in about one third of the territory. So in order to complete the mission, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=267.28s)]
*  we have to go south. We have to go to where the leadership is hiding in the southern part of Gaza. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=273.59999999999997s)]
*  It will take some time, but once we will see a regime change, it will be good and safe for us, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=278.55999999999995s)]
*  but also for the people in Gaza. Once there will be another regime in charge of Gaza. You know, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=284.64s)]
*  it's like Ibadika in the Nazi regime. It takes time, it takes effort, it takes casualties, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=289.84s)]
*  but we have to do it. Danny, God bless. Good luck to you. Appreciate you joining us. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=294.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. Thank you. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ1tMNOQ4ck&t=300.16s)]
