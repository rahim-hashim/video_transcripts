# Shocking new study reveals Harvard University is the worst school for free speech
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs)
*  U-Penn president Liz McGill is stepping down following her controversial testimony earlier [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=0.0s)]
*  this week about anti-Semitism on college campuses. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=6.48s)]
*  So let's go off the wall to better understand what's happening and how it shows a trend [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=10.0s)]
*  of schools turning students away from religion and conservatism. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  Because it didn't start or it doesn't end with anti-Semitism, which is the recent manifestation. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=19.92s)]
*  But these schools have been going off the rails for a long time. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=25.96s)]
*  So you've got Harvard, you've got Penn, you've got MIT, so-called elite schools, but well, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=27.92s)]
*  they've been infected with a certain viewpoint that's been pushed for a very long time. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=33.36s)]
*  I think the very long time is the point that needs to be hammered home. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=37.2s)]
*  This is not new for Harvard, MIT or Penn, but it hit a flashpoint over the Israel-Hamas [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=40.6s)]
*  war that was obvious from campus to campus. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  In support, largely, of Palestine, of Gaza, and unmistakably at times, Pete, crossing over into anti-Semitism. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=50.96s)]
*  No doubt. And I want to focus on U-Penn for a second because Liz McGill was under fire even before October 7th. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=60.84s)]
*  There was a group that invited a pro-Palestinian, anti-Israel speaker that was saying things like [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=66.64s)]
*  from the river to the sea, and the alumni didn't like that. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=71.76s)]
*  Then October 7th happened, and protests like this occurred, and she did nothing and said nothing. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=74.64s)]
*  Then you had the testimony. So it was sort of a third strike for Liz McGill on the issue of anti-Semitism. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=79.76s)]
*  And it wasn't just protests. Images flashed up at various times from other campuses, Harvard and in MIT. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  We saw images of Jewish students in cafeterias getting chased into areas and barricaded in from [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=90.0s)]
*  what felt like to them, and I think, pretty objectively, obvious threats. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=97.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and protests like this are the end state of students who've been taught a particular [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=101.84s)]
*  worldview, especially in this case on anti-Semitism, about the Middle East. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=108.4s)]
*  You've got a lot of foreign money coming into these, a lot of foreign money coming into these universities, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=113.2s)]
*  a lot of it coming from the Middle East that paints a certain picture. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=117.36000000000001s)]
*  And so now you have protests after a terror attack that are effectively supporting a terrorist organization, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=120.64s)]
*  and the university's doing nothing. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  So whether or not it's that foreign money or a long-baked ideology, it led to moments like this [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=127.76s)]
*  in Congress, where you have the presidents of these three universities, MIT, Harvard and Penn, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=133.36s)]
*  testifying in very unimpressive fashion with Congresswoman Elise Stefanik. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=138.56s)]
*  Specifically calling for the genocide of Jews, does that constitute bullying or harassment? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=146.96s)]
*  If it is directed and severe or pervasive, it is harassment. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=154.56s)]
*  So the answer is yes. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=158.32000000000002s)]
*  It is a context-dependent decision. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=160.32000000000002s)]
*  Calling for the genocide of Jews does not constitute bullying and harassment? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=162.48s)]
*  I have not heard calling for the genocide for Jews on our campus. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=166.16s)]
*  But you've heard chants for Intifada? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=169.44s)]
*  I've heard chants, which can be anti-Semitic, depending on the context. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=172.32s)]
*  At Harvard, does calling for the genocide of Jews violate Harvard's rules of bullying and harassment? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=176.72s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  It can be, depending on the context. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=184.56s)]
*  So a lot of the pressure started with donors, too, Will, donors at these universities, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=187.28s)]
*  one of which is John Huntsman, said the Huntsman Foundation, a big donor to UPenn, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=191.28s)]
*  is going to close its checkbook in the future. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=195.36s)]
*  Les Wexner, the Wexner Foundation, huge clothing brand, deeply connected for what it's worth [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  to the scandal around Jeffrey Epstein, but also a big donor to some of these Ivy League colleges, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=202.48s)]
*  said the Harvard Kennedy School and the Wexner Foundation are no longer compatible partners, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=206.64s)]
*  our core values and those of Harvard no longer align. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=210.96s)]
*  By the way, having been to the Harvard Kennedy School, I bet a lot of the things the Kennedy [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=214.24s)]
*  School for a long time has been teaching kids is not aligned with the views of a lot of people [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=218.16s)]
*  that donate. They're just not looking. It took the support of terror organizations for them [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=222.79999999999998s)]
*  to figure that out. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=227.04s)]
*  Seen it from others like Bill Ackman as well. Now, that's led to this, that's led to the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=227.6s)]
*  resignation of Liz McGill at the University of Pennsylvania. Nothing yet from MIT and Harvard. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=232.48s)]
*  I mean, Claudine Gay came out with a straight-up apology in the Harvard Crimson, trying to back [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=239.28s)]
*  track it. A lot of it will depend on how much donor and alumni pressure truly comes to bear. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=244.08s)]
*  Letters sent by 74 members of Congress reads, the leadership of top universities plays a pivotal [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  role in shaping the moral compass of our future leaders. It's critically important that such [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=252.96s)]
*  leadership reflects a clear and unwavering commitment to combating anti-Semitism, along [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=257.52000000000004s)]
*  with all forms of hate speech and bigotry. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=262.64s)]
*  Yeah, the context on from the river to the sea is Israel's gone. So that whole, and what they tried [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=264.48s)]
*  to hide behind, Will, this entire testimony, suddenly now they love free speech. All these [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=271.04s)]
*  campus presidents are all about free speech. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=275.44s)]
*  But we mentioned this is part of a long-banked ideology that forces you to see the world [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=277.52000000000004s)]
*  through oppressor and oppressed. And the oppressed are the ones that benefit from free speech, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=282.24s)]
*  while the perceived oppressor can have his speech censored. Look at the history of what this has [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=286.8s)]
*  done. This has put Harvard in the bottom five of campuses intolerant of free speech. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=291.92s)]
*  Not just the bottom five. The worst campus in America for free speech is Harvard University. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=296.88s)]
*  Yet, if you want to chant something that's blatantly anti-Semitic, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=304.0s)]
*  we've got to provide some context, Will. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=307.6s)]
*  And just as an example of how that has shown up in your news cycle over several years, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=309.6s)]
*  I mean pushing for Justice Kavanaugh's rescission of his appointment. Over and over, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=314.32s)]
*  you've seen these moments where they've been intolerant of speech, often conservative speech. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=320.88s)]
*  Disinviting speakers, conservative speech, Christian organizations. Oh, you can't say [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=325.68s)]
*  that here because speech might be violence. You can't talk about this pro-life issue over here. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=330.48s)]
*  You might misgender somebody. But when it comes to anti-Semitism, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=335.52s)]
*  wow, you've got context. You've got to know more about that. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=338.96000000000004s)]
*  Off the wall, more Fox and Friends. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-LI0j5Azs&t=341.84000000000003s)]
