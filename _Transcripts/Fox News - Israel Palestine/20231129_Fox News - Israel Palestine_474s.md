# These are nerve-racking moments for every Israeli: Netanyahu spokeswoman
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU)
*  With us now back with us is Tal Haimer, spokesman for the Israeli government, a veteran journalist [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=0.0s)]
*  in that fine country as well. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=5.88s)]
*  Tal, good to see you back. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=7.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=8.52s)]
*  So let me talk about the dozen today. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=9.52s)]
*  And the math, and I've been following it closely, Tal, seems to favor at least three times as [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  many Palestinians released as Israelis released. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=21.76s)]
*  Well, it's not a perfect outline. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=25.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=27.64s)]
*  Thomas Sol here, there are no good solutions, only tradeoffs. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=29.080000000000002s)]
*  This is the tradeoff that we have agreed upon. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=32.72s)]
*  And we hope to see the release of more hostages. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=36.08s)]
*  This is not enough. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=38.260000000000005s)]
*  Many more hostages are still being held in captivity for 53 plus days right now. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=39.260000000000005s)]
*  We hope that maybe tomorrow we'll see the mechanism repeating again. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=44.620000000000005s)]
*  We said that for every extra 10 Israeli hostages that Hamas would agree to release, then we [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=49.74s)]
*  to another day of humanitarian pause in the fighting and to the release of more Palestinian [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=55.72s)]
*  prisoners who were involved in terrorist activities. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=61.8s)]
*  So we still haven't received a list for tomorrow, but we hope to get one. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=65.7s)]
*  These are nerve-racking moments every day for every Israeli. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=71.32s)]
*  People in my country are watching, you know, glued to their news TV screens, waiting every [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=76.36s)]
*  to maybe get this momentary sigh of relief that here some more hostages are coming home. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=82.28s)]
*  But what reality are they coming back to? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=89.28s)]
*  Two siblings, a boy and a girl aged 13 and 16 who were released yesterday came back and [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=92.52s)]
*  discovered that their mother was killed by Hamas terrorists and that their father is [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=98.25999999999999s)]
*  still in Gaza. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=103.47999999999999s)]
*  And we're hearing now about the conditions in which these people were kept. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=104.97999999999999s)]
*  Nine-year-old Emily Henn, she still whispers, her father says, because that's what she was [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=110.16s)]
*  used to when guarded by Hamas terrorists. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=116.11999999999999s)]
*  12-year-old Eitan Yalomi, he told his family members and they told various media outlets [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=119.28s)]
*  that he was being held alone for 16 days in a room without other hostages and that Hamas [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=126.14s)]
*  terrorists used to beat them up when they showed them the children, the videos of their [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=133.84s)]
*  atrocities from October 7th. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=138.52s)]
*  And when the children cried, they beat them up. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=140.42000000000002s)]
*  Well, what if now, if it's 70 of the 240 hostages have been released thus far and now Hamas [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=143.08s)]
*  is throwing in the possibility that some of those hostages are in private entity hands. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=150.20000000000002s)]
*  I don't know how that all worked out. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=155.36s)]
*  But are they just stringing this along, this process? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=158.18s)]
*  You brought up a very interesting point because among the 10 hostages, the Israeli hostages [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=161.44s)]
*  and two Thai citizens who worked in Israel and were released today, from what I'm hearing [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=166.3s)]
*  is that a few of them were held by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which is just to the viewers, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=175.3s)]
*  this is the second largest terrorist organization in the Gaza Strip. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=180.1s)]
*  They are fully funded by Iran, getting their marching orders by Iran, a full proxy of the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=183.68s)]
*  Islamic regime. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=189.78s)]
*  And Hamas, they're getting 93, 90 or so percent of their budget coming from Iran. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=192.26s)]
*  So two of them were held by Palestinian Islamic Jihad from what the IDF spokesperson in Arabic [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=196.3s)]
*  announced a few days ago. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=201.02s)]
*  Also 10 month old baby Kfir Bibas is being held by this group. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=203.72s)]
*  So it's an interesting development that we saw. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=208.94s)]
*  But you know, we're holding Hamas accountable for everything that's happening in the Gaza [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=211.34s)]
*  Strip. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=215.38s)]
*  They are the ones. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=216.38s)]
*  When they can't identify where some of those hostages have ended up, do you fear that some [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=217.38s)]
*  of them might be dead? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=221.74s)]
*  Well, of course we're worried. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=224.14s)]
*  We're praying for the best. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=226.34s)]
*  What can we do in this situation? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=229.62s)]
*  Which gets me back to this, whether Hamas could string things along. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=230.62s)]
*  The reason why I mention it is Benjamin Netanyahu has reiterated this offer to extend the ceasefire, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=233.5s)]
*  as you aptly pointed out, an additional day for every 10 hostages released. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=238.22s)]
*  But he also said that Israel would resume its offensive against Hamas with all of its [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=242.84s)]
*  power once the ceasefire expires. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=247.44s)]
*  So I'm Hamas hearing that. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=249.32s)]
*  Let's just keep delaying delaying. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=251.72s)]
*  So the humanitarian pause in the fighting this day is supposed to give Hamas terrorists. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=253.88s)]
*  They claim they need the time to go and fetch all the hostages that they need for the same [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=260.32s)]
*  batch that would be released the same day. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=265.56s)]
*  You know, we're dealing with a brutal terrorist organization, the one that mutilated, raped, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=268.26s)]
*  or tortured our people on October 7th. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=272.4s)]
*  They obviously cannot be trusted, as President Biden correctly stated. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=274.2s)]
*  They only respond to pressure and we will continue to exert more military pressure on [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=278.12s)]
*  them. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=283.36s)]
*  Do we know anything, Pal, about the Palestinians that have been released? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=284.36s)]
*  Many more of them than Israelis. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=288.2s)]
*  You mean the Palestinian prisoners that we have been releasing. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=290.88s)]
*  So listen, again, there's no comparison here whatsoever. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=293.16s)]
*  We are releasing people who attempted to stab, murder, burn Israelis, throwing Molotov cocktails [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=297.26s)]
*  at them. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=304.78000000000003s)]
*  I can tell you, for example, just the story of one of them. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=305.78000000000003s)]
*  Her name, her last name is Shabai, Yasmin Shaban. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=308.94s)]
*  In 2014, she attempted a suicide bombing. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=311.90000000000003s)]
*  She was planning a suicide bombing in the middle of Tel Aviv. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=314.8s)]
*  She was, she wanted to disguise herself as a pregnant Jewish woman wearing an explosive [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=317.46000000000004s)]
*  belt. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=323.14s)]
*  Then she was released. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=324.14s)]
*  Just last year, we arrested her again because she was planning additional attacks on Israelis. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=325.26s)]
*  So how do we know there aren't more like that being released by Israel? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=330.21999999999997s)]
*  Again, it's not a perfect deal. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=334.65999999999997s)]
*  It's not what we wanted. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=338.06s)]
*  We value life. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=339.09999999999997s)]
*  We are very proud to be part of this nation that leaves nobody behind. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=340.44s)]
*  This is the deal that we agreed upon. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=344.58s)]
*  But you fear the people that you are releasing could very well come back and do what you [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=346.14s)]
*  cited there. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=350.32s)]
*  It's, of course, it's a worrying situation. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=351.32s)]
*  It's a very disturbing situation. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=353.86s)]
*  But, you know, Hamas terrorists know it, that we value life so much. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=355.7s)]
*  And when you are part of a nation that values life to this extent, it makes you vulnerable. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=361.02000000000004s)]
*  We should say it. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=366.46000000000004s)]
*  You know, I know you're doing Yeoman's work, trying to get the government's position out [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=367.78000000000003s)]
*  there where this is going. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=373.1s)]
*  There was an effort a little more than a couple of weeks ago by this coalition government [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=375.38s)]
*  where some were saying, get mad at Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=380.98s)]
*  You screwed things up. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=384.46s)]
*  There was one member who was even talking to the opposition leader. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=385.46s)]
*  Maybe he should go. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=389.3s)]
*  Someone from Likud should take his place. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=390.7s)]
*  Is it holding together or are nerves frazzling here? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=392.74s)]
*  I can tell you what is holding together. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=395.54s)]
*  The unity government is holding together and it's really reflective of the public sentiment [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=397.62s)]
*  in Israel right now. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=402.5s)]
*  So the one opposition leader who said he's got to go, is he a distinct minority there? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=403.76s)]
*  Well, and even he, when he was interviewed on American media, he said, we are united [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=409.06s)]
*  right now. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=414.3s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=415.3s)]
*  This is, and it's 100% correct. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=416.3s)]
*  Everyone in the country, when Hamas terrorists butchered us, they didn't care who we voted [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=419.3s)]
*  for. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=422.98s)]
*  So, and everyone in the country understands that. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=423.98s)]
*  Tom, thank you very, very much. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=427.26s)]
*  Hal Heinrich, the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's spokesperson here, a veteran Israeli journalist [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=428.90000000000003s)]
*  in her own right, keeping us posted on those developments. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=434.74s)]
*  Just to bring some of these numbers up to date before we go to a quick break here. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=437.82s)]
*  70 of the 240 hostages have been released thus far. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=441.26s)]
*  There's talk of extending this pause in activity to allow for still more to come back. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=445.42s)]
*  But again, no firm word on that, whether this will definitely extend into a sixth day. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=451.58s)]
*  Hi everyone, I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCqMgdtHU&t=455.86s)]
