# This could lead to a ‘widespread’ regional war: Dem senator
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28)
*  Joining me now, Virginia Democratic Senator Mark Warner. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=0.0s)]
*  He's the chair of the Senate Intel Committee. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=2.64s)]
*  Welcome back to Fox News Sunday. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=4.2s)]
*  Good to see you again. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=5.2s)]
*  I want to get some of your reaction there, because I know you've expressed concerns that [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=6.2s)]
*  Israel is not being precise enough with these strikes. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=8.94s)]
*  You heard the ambassador there. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=12.38s)]
*  He says they have been very targeted, that there are hundreds of miles or kilometers, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=13.38s)]
*  in his words, of these terror tunnels everywhere. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=16.68s)]
*  They're offering to evacuate people from hospitals. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=19.12s)]
*  They're in communication with them. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=21.6s)]
*  What's your reaction? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=23.2s)]
*  Well, my reaction is clearly Israel has a right to defend itself, and Hamas has been [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=24.2s)]
*  using human shields. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=29.2s)]
*  But the images don't lie. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  We've seen for weeks at some level indiscriminate Israeli bombing, particularly in terms of [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=32.64s)]
*  artillery and some of the plane bombings. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=39.6s)]
*  I think now that the troops have surrounded Gaza City, I think they are getting more targeted. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=42.32s)]
*  I think it's very important that these humanitarian pauses take place each time so that we can, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=48.28s)]
*  people can get to safety. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=55.559999999999995s)]
*  But also, we've seen literally hundreds of folks with American passports be able to leave [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=56.72s)]
*  Gaza into Egypt. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=62.48s)]
*  That's important as well, because I think one of the things we have to realize is that [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  clearly Israel has the military ability to take out Hamas. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=69.0s)]
*  But this is also a battle about hearts and minds, hearts and minds in terms of maintaining [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=73.32s)]
*  support for Israel in this country, in the world, and in the region. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=78.38s)]
*  One of the things that a number of us pressed the Israeli government, and we've seen some [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=83.02s)]
*  positive response, stop turning away from the settler violence in the West Bank. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=87.94s)]
*  I've had a fear for a long time what happens if the Palestinian security services all quit [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=94.02s)]
*  and suddenly the West Bank would erupt as a second flank. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=99.38s)]
*  And that's why I think Israel, we are holding Israel obviously to a higher standard than [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=102.66s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=107.02s)]
*  And that's why I think it's important both the pauses and to make sure as much as possible [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=109.02s)]
*  they're targeting. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=115.42s)]
*  Yeah, I've spent time in Ramallah there and I know how tense that situation is. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=116.42s)]
*  I saw yesterday that Senators Rosen and Rubio are going to offer an ability for senators [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=120.46s)]
*  to screen some of these videos that show the Hamas atrocities. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=125.66s)]
*  Would you attend that this week? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=129.5s)]
*  Do you think it'll watch? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=130.5s)]
*  I've seen some of those already in my role as chairman of the Intelligence Committee. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=131.5s)]
*  I hope to see the whole 40 odd minute. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=135.7s)]
*  I think it is, they will be horrific images. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=138.82s)]
*  I do think recognizing that you have got to protect the privacy of these families who've [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=142.26s)]
*  been so abused. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=148.33999999999997s)]
*  But the more Israel can release some of this footage, the more they can as they achieve [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  their goals for example and declassify information to demonstrate that there are these tunnels [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=156.16s)]
*  under the hospitals. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=161.88s)]
*  I think it's terribly important because otherwise what America sees and the world sees only [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=163.42000000000002s)]
*  for the most part is some of the obviously horrible images of now over 11,000 Palestinians [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=168.74s)]
*  killed. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=175.46s)]
*  Let's talk about Iran. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=176.46s)]
*  We had this image yesterday of Iran's president being warmly greeted in Saudi Arabia. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=177.56s)]
*  There's this gathering with Arab and Muslim leaders denouncing Israel, calling for the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=180.98000000000002s)]
*  International Criminal Commission to actually go after them for war crimes. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=184.7s)]
*  And there have been questions about whether this administration is being tough enough [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=190.34s)]
*  on Iran. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=193.42000000000002s)]
*  There have been several attacks by Iranian proxies on our soldiers in the region. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=194.42000000000002s)]
*  Wall Street Journal editorial board writing this, it said, Iran isn't impressed by US [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=197.9s)]
*  airstrikes. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=202.06s)]
*  The confounding reality is that President Biden's weak responses to attacks on US forces [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=203.06s)]
*  aren't deterring Iran and its proxies, which increases the risk of escalation. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=207.1s)]
*  They also point out that the US has not been cracking down on oil sanctions. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=212.1s)]
*  to the tune of benefiting them tens of billions of dollars. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=218.18s)]
*  Do you think the administration is handling Iran well? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=221.5s)]
*  Listen, I think by placing both a carrier group in the Red Sea, Eastern Med, announcing [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=223.86s)]
*  that we've sent an Ohio class submarine, we never normally announce that, and bombing [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=231.28s)]
*  some of the facilities outside of Iran, I think it's terribly important. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=237.98000000000002s)]
*  I think Iran is very aware of the military presence we're being there. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=242.66000000000003s)]
*  But I also think that's kind of unusual. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=246.94s)]
*  We saw the Republican debate earlier this week, where everybody was talking about, let's [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=249.82s)]
*  go after Iran directly, which could literally lead to a widespread regional war. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=254.18s)]
*  And the thing that I don't understand, again, from some of our Republican presidential candidates, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=260.08s)]
*  is that they want to be tough on Iran, but they want to walk away from Putin's aggression [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=264.3s)]
*  in Ukraine. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=269.9s)]
*  Who is Iran's biggest ally? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=271.62s)]
*  It's Russia. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=273.3s)]
*  Iran is providing the drones for Russia. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=274.3s)]
*  The idea that we're going to allow a dictator to win in terms of Putin and Ukraine, and [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=277.1s)]
*  then not recognize there's a connection between Russia, between Iran, between Xi and President [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=283.58s)]
*  China in China, is, I think, short-sighted. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=289.42s)]
*  And I do think our focus is on the Middle East, our focus with the president in terms [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=292.66s)]
*  of meeting with Xi, but it would be a historic mistake if America walked away from Ukraine [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=296.78000000000003s)]
*  at this point. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=304.18s)]
*  The very people who are criticizing the president now, no country would ever trust us again [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=305.18s)]
*  if we walk away from Ukraine. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=310.09999999999997s)]
*  Well, isn't there something in between walking away and providing some funding or providing [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=311.38s)]
*  endless open-ended funding, which Americans are worried about? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=315.78s)]
*  We talked about this on the show last week, that there are polling numbers that show a [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=318.34s)]
*  lot of Americans are growing apprehensive about something that has no end in sight. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=321.7s)]
*  We're about to run out of money by Friday if you guys don't get something done on the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=326.5s)]
*  Hill. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=329.58s)]
*  I mean, none of us at home could run our budgets this way. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=330.58s)]
*  So what do you say to folks? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=332.34s)]
*  These are American tax dollars. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=333.42s)]
*  How we manage these priorities? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=335.46000000000004s)]
*  The fact is, literally, combined with our European allies, who frankly are doing more [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=337.42s)]
*  on the humanitarian side and matching us virtually dollar for dollar on the defense side, an [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=343.54s)]
*  additional $60 billion for the whole balance of the fiscal year. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=348.34000000000003s)]
*  And the Ukrainians have literally destroyed over half of Russia's military capabilities [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=353.94s)]
*  with not a single loss of an American soldier or NATO soldier. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=359.42s)]
*  We, if we walk away from Ukraine, NATO, which has been expanded by Sweden and Finland, what [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=363.22s)]
*  faith would they ever have on us? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=369.90000000000003s)]
*  And again, I'm hugely concerned about China, particularly both on an economic basis, technology [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=371.70000000000005s)]
*  basis. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=377.1s)]
*  And the people are flunking geopolitics one-on-one. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=378.1s)]
*  If they think giving Putin a win on Ukraine won't send a signal to President Xi and China, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=381.42s)]
*  then he's got a green light to go after Taiwan. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=387.1s)]
*  Let's talk about that meeting this week because President Biden, President Xi are going to [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=389.26000000000005s)]
*  in San Francisco. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=392.26s)]
*  There's a lot of pressure for some kind of measurable deliverables from this meeting. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=393.26s)]
*  What should the president's message be? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=398.3s)]
*  I think they've already pre-signaled that having military and military communication, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=399.82s)]
*  so somebody picks up the phone. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=404.74s)]
*  If there is an incident, we saw nobody picking up the phone after the shooting down of the [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=407.26s)]
*  Chinese balloon. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=411.1s)]
*  I also think we need to keep pressure on China in terms of stopping their intellectual property [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=412.76s)]
*  theft, close to $500 billion a year. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=418.46s)]
*  And I hope what we will also do is rally other allies in the region because candidly, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=421.02s)]
*  as chairman of the Intelligence Committee, national security now is not simply who's [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=426.7s)]
*  got the most tanks and guns and ships and planes. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=430.65999999999997s)]
*  It's who's going to win the battle for artificial intelligence, quantum computing, advanced [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=433.53999999999996s)]
*  telecommunications, 5G and beyond. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=438.58s)]
*  We can win all those battles, but we've got to do them with our allies as well. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=441.38s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1OduQbf28&t=444.5s)]
