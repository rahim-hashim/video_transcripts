*  Hi Jennifer, good to have you with us. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfnlKjz2WS4&t=15.52s)]
*  Hi Martha, thank you. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfnlKjz2WS4&t=17.36s)]
*  Hamas was founded in 1987 by Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, a Palestinian cleric whose family were refugees [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfnlKjz2WS4&t=19.04s)]
*  in Gaza as a result of the 1948 war following the creation of Israel. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfnlKjz2WS4&t=25.04s)]
*  Sheikh Yassin spent his early life in Cairo exposed to the Muslim Brotherhood. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfnlKjz2WS4&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  To stop the Oslo peace talks, Hamas began carrying out a series of suicide bombings [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfnlKjz2WS4&t=34.72s)]
*  beginning in April 1993. In 1997, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent the Mossad [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfnlKjz2WS4&t=39.68s)]
*  to assassinate Hamas leader Khalid Mashal in Jordan. The attempt was botched and as part of the deal, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfnlKjz2WS4&t=46.16s)]

*  Iraq war began. Are you calling for jihad against American troops? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfnlKjz2WS4&t=70.64s)]
*  I gave a fatwa to resist the Americans in Iraq. I gave a fatwa to fight Americans if the Americans [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfnlKjz2WS4&t=75.67999999999999s)]
*  enter Iraq. Then it is legal and right to fight the Americans if they are on Iraqi land. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfnlKjz2WS4&t=84.72s)]
*  Israel assassinated the wheelchair-bound Sheikh Yassin a few months later as he was [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfnlKjz2WS4&t=91.75999999999999s)]

*  all Jewish settlers and settlements from Gaza. Twelve days later, after the pullout was complete, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfnlKjz2WS4&t=103.6s)]
*  Hamas began firing rockets into Israel. A year later, after the U.S. encouraged the Palestinians [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfnlKjz2WS4&t=109.11999999999999s)]
*  to hold elections, Hamas won in a landslide in Gaza in 2006. The group violently took control, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfnlKjz2WS4&t=114.72s)]
*  in some cases throwing the leaders of the Palestinian Authority off rooftops in Gaza. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfnlKjz2WS4&t=121.52s)]
*  Its current military leader of Hamas in Gaza, Yehya Sinwar, was released from an Israeli [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfnlKjz2WS4&t=127.19999999999999s)]
*  prison during a prisoner swap for the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in 2011. He was treated in [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfnlKjz2WS4&t=133.36s)]
*  an Israeli hospital for a brain tumor, his life saved by an Israeli doctor. Martha? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfnlKjz2WS4&t=139.60000000000002s)]
