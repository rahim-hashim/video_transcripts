# Holding anti-Israel protesters accountable is ‘long overdue’: GOP lawmaker
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [March 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw)
*  The [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=0.0s)]
*  Columbia University is just the first target for President Trump's joint task force to [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=7.0s)]
*  combat anti-Semitism. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=11.46s)]
*  Nine other universities also are under investigation for allegedly failing to protect their Jewish [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=13.26s)]
*  students. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=19.04s)]
*  Here to weigh in, Utah Republican Congressman Burgess Owens. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=20.04s)]
*  He's the vice chair of the House Education and Workforce Committee. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=23.36s)]
*  What do you think, Congressman, of the action that the Trump administration is taking here? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=27.52s)]
*  John, it's about accountability. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=31.92s)]
*  The CV just said that once you hit the pocketbook, you get some people's attention. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=34.8s)]
*  And that's what we needed. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=39.64s)]
*  Unfortunately, we've had a system in place for way too long in which there was just no [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=40.64s)]
*  accountability whatsoever. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  There was no sense of what the responsibility was and if they were off track that they had [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  to get back on. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=50.92s)]
*  We have a president who's defining what we need to have in the future, which is a very [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=51.92s)]
*  smart, a smart group of people coming through the college system and one that understands [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=55.76s)]
*  our concept of becoming a more perfect union, which means we cannot discriminate no matter [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=61.6s)]
*  what it might be against each other. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=66.4s)]
*  So I'm excited about where we are and we're going to see more colleges step to the plate [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=68.08s)]
*  for sure because of things that happen right now. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=71.48s)]
*  Apparently, at least one student who was foreign born and was here on a visa has had that visa [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  revoked as a result of protesting too vehemently. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=81.66s)]
*  What do you think about that move, Congressman? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=86.06s)]
*  It's needed. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=89.66s)]
*  We have people that we welcome here to come visit. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=90.66s)]
*  We don't welcome to come here and visit and attack Americans or to cause divisiveness. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=93.62s)]
*  If they want to do that, they need to do that back where they came from. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=98.86s)]
*  So now we demand respect. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=101.86s)]
*  We demand that people come here and if you want to protest or give a voice, do it in [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=105.42s)]
*  a respectful way, in a way that's not taking away the rights of others. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=110.38s)]
*  And I think it's well overdue. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=113.5s)]
*  We have young people who have no idea, again, what accountability looks like and we're finally [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=114.5s)]
*  getting it done. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=118.06s)]
*  This will be a good example for those who want to stay here, want to get an education. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=119.06s)]
*  If that's the goal, just do it right. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=121.58s)]
*  And if you stay here and get it done and take advantage of our great country. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=123.89999999999999s)]
*  As you know, there are a lot of people who are crying racism here. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=126.94s)]
*  What do you think about that? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=131.0s)]
*  It's the same group that always calls racism, the same group that has DEI in which they're [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=133.74s)]
*  asking us to look at each other from outside in and inside out to call racism. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=138.18s)]
*  Now we're done. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=140.9s)]
*  We're done with that. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=141.9s)]
*  We want to be American people that see each other as America's number one and what's best [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=143.18s)]
*  for our country. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=148.18s)]
*  We might not agree on everything, but we don't dig first thing into looking at something [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=149.18s)]
*  in our exterior and make charges in that regard. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=153.94000000000003s)]
*  So we're done with the calls of being called racism. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=156.66000000000003s)]
*  We're over it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=159.14000000000001s)]
*  And now it's time for us to move forward. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=160.14000000000001s)]
*  Get our country to where we love each other and we see the best of each other and we want [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=161.9s)]
*  to make sure our country thrives. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=166.62s)]
*  And that's the way we do this. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=167.62s)]
*  It's coming out of the college system for sure. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=168.62s)]
*  You know something about racism. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=170.85999999999999s)]
*  You grew up in the deep south. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=172.45999999999998s)]
*  Is there a parallel between some of the things you experienced as a young person and what's [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=175.89999999999998s)]
*  happening today on some of these college campuses? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=181.73999999999998s)]
*  It's a great question. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=185.45999999999998s)]
*  A couple of things. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=186.94s)]
*  When you're teaching someone to make decisions on others based on their skin color or their [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=188.94s)]
*  culture, we're getting away from merit. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=194.01999999999998s)]
*  We're getting away from the character base that has always been who we are. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=195.74s)]
*  And the other thing is, I remember back in the 60s, those who were the most vicious, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=199.06s)]
*  the angriest, are the ones also hit. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=203.74s)]
*  They hit behind, hit under white hoods. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=205.94s)]
*  So we now see people hiding their faces. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=208.98000000000002s)]
*  If you want to make a point, have the conversation. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=210.54000000000002s)]
*  Don't hide your face because at that point you're empowering folks who are really cowards [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=213.94s)]
*  to do things that they would not do if it was very apparent and able to see people for [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=218.26000000000002s)]
*  who they are. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=224.46s)]
*  We're going to get back to that, and I'm excited about the process. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=226.18s)]
*  President Trump is the right person to lead the charge, for sure. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=228.1s)]
*  I want to play a sound clip from the Secretary of Education. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=231.38s)]
*  President Trump is talking about dismantling the Education Department and handing that [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=236.82s)]
*  role back to the states. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=241.14000000000001s)]
*  Listen. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=243.86s)]
*  I think there is definitely a role for education to make sure that as we move education back [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=244.86s)]
*  to the states, that we are providing the tools for the governors, for the teachers, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=251.02s)]
*  that we can provide them with research to show best practices. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=256.06s)]
*  Because the president's goal really is to see our scores go up. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=260.18s)]
*  When 70 percent of our students cannot read with proficiency, that's just incredibly [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=264.18s)]
*  difficult to swallow. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=270.46000000000004s)]
*  And he's just not going to accept it. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=272.02s)]
*  Of every dollar that comes into the classroom, they spend about 47 cents of that dollar complying [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=273.3s)]
*  with regulations. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=280.18s)]
*  I want, and the president wants, to release teachers to be innovative in their classrooms, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=281.18s)]
*  let teachers teach. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=285.38s)]
*  You think dismantling the Department of Education is a worthy idea? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=287.5s)]
*  It is a worthy idea because, keep in mind, the Department of Education has not done its [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=291.3s)]
*  job since it began back in 1978. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=296.62s)]
*  We were number one at that time in terms of educating our kids. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=299.02000000000004s)]
*  Now we're in our 40s, and people expect us to be okay with that. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=301.34000000000003s)]
*  Now there's one job that the Department of Education should have, to make sure we have [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=304.86s)]
*  the smartest kids, most prepared kids in the entire world. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=308.42s)]
*  That's not what they've been doing. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=311.22s)]
*  So let's do something that is based on the way our Constitution is set up with the people. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=312.82s)]
*  Send the power to make sure that our kids are being educated and their accountability [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=318.74s)]
*  to the states, to the districts. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=322.3s)]
*  They will make sure at that point that every child has a choice to get their American dream [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=323.98s)]
*  and the powers that have been taken out of the hands of the bureaucrats. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=328.34000000000003s)]
*  And by the way, the bureaucratic establishment cares about one thing. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=331.26s)]
*  That's the adults. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=334.38s)]
*  They care about the institutions. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=335.38s)]
*  We need to have an education system that cares strictly, totally about our kids and our future [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=337.06s)]
*  of their legacy of being able to pass this great culture we have down to the next generation. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=341.34s)]
*  It's going to be fascinating to see what happens with this plan of the president's congressman, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=346.5s)]
*  Burgess Owens. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=351.34000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=352.34000000000003s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=353.34000000000003s)]
*  Thank you, John. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=354.34000000000003s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=355.34000000000003s)]
*  All the best. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvtPMQjXOw&t=356.34000000000003s)]
