# This could be 'beginning of the end' for Hamas, says expert
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc)
*  President Trump is headed to the Middle East next week for the first official [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=0.0s)]
*  foreign trip of his second term. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  So we're going to be having some conferences next week. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  I'll also be going to Saudi Arabia and other places. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=11.6s)]
*  Going to UAE and Qatar and some of you will be going with us at an interesting time. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=17.6s)]
*  The president's presence in the region comes as Israel just approved a plan to capture the entire Gaza Strip, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=26.6s)]
*  holding captured territory until all of its war goals are met, including eliminating Hamas and freeing the remaining hostages. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=32.6s)]
*  Daniel Flesch is a former senior advisor to Israel's mission at the United Nations, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=40.300000000000004s)]
*  a former IDF paratrooper and visiting fellow in the Allison Center for National Security at the Heritage Foundation. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=45.1s)]
*  And he joins me now. Daniel, good morning to you. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=51.1s)]
*  Approving this plan to capture the entire Gaza Strip and also calling up tens of thousands of reserve fighters to do so is a big deal. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=53.4s)]
*  So tell us about the significance of this decision and how you think this will all play out. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=61.4s)]
*  Yes, well, good morning, Carly. Thank you for having me. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=68.3s)]
*  This is Israel demonstrating its intent to finally take the one thing Hamas holds most dear, which is territory. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=70.9s)]
*  Hamas demonstrates more than willing to sacrifice its own civilian population in Gaza. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=78.8s)]
*  It does not care about its own survival, but really cares about territory, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=83.89999999999999s)]
*  because how can you fight Israel and try to reclaim Palestine, as they call it, without territory? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=87.3s)]
*  So this is demonstrating Israel's resolve to take that from them with a classic counterterrorism strategy of clearing, holding and then building upon a territory. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=92.7s)]
*  Now, each phase remains. It was indeterminate at this point. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=101.0s)]
*  But this is demonstrating Israel's resolve to finally take from Hamas territory, which can actually finally spell the end of the beginning of the end of this war. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=104.19999999999999s)]
*  And again, we know from the past two hostage for ceasefire negotiations and deals that were done in the one earlier this year and the first one in November of 2023, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=113.1s)]
*  the military pressure brings Hamas to the negotiating table. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=121.69999999999999s)]
*  Now Israel is showing that it will bring military pressure, in addition, territorial pressure that perhaps could also receive the release of some more hostages. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=125.0s)]
*  An Israeli official said that Hamas has until President Trump's Middle East visit next week to make a deal, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=132.29999999999998s)]
*  or the next ramped up phase of this war in capturing territory will begin. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=137.6s)]
*  The European Union, though, does not like this idea. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=142.2s)]
*  They released a statement saying escalating would result in further casualties and suffering for the Palestinian population and urged Israeli forces to exercise the utmost restraint. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=145.0s)]
*  Israel is no stranger to pressure. And here it is again. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=155.79999999999998s)]
*  I'm sure with your workings with the UN, you're not surprised by this comment. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=158.1s)]
*  But what is your reaction to this pressure that Israel is once again facing from the international community? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=161.2s)]
*  You're right. I'm not all surprised by this by this comments from the Europeans. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=168.4s)]
*  You know, for many months last year, many of the international community, including Europe, including the UN, were saying that Gaza was facing starvation and a famine. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=172.7s)]
*  That turned out to be false. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=180.9s)]
*  Many, including the previous American administration, said that Israel cannot go into certain cities in Ra'a without moving the civilian population to keep them out of harm's way. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=182.6s)]
*  That proved out to be false. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=191.1s)]
*  And if you look at the history of armed conflict in the 21st century, Israel has far surpassed any sort of standards in ensuring that civilian casualties are kept to a minimum. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=192.5s)]
*  So all the naysayers and all the other European communities and leaders out there who say that Israel should not be doing this, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=202.4s)]
*  it's only because Israel has been defying those those perceived warnings that is able to defeat Hamas, which is a threat not just to Israel, not just the United States, but also to Europeans. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=209.2s)]
*  So it is a good thing that Israel not be heeding these warnings that Israel needs to do what it can to defeat Hamas in this war for survival. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=219.5s)]
*  I mean, it's a big goal. And, you know, as a former IDF paratrooper, just militarily, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=225.79999999999998s)]
*  Is it possible for Israel and the Israeli military to take over the entire Gaza Strip, get the Hamas fighters out and keep the Israeli hostages safe in the end? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=230.4s)]
*  Certainly it would be a difficult challenge. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=245.6s)]
*  And it's not clear just yet if Israel needs to take over all of the Gaza Strip, for example. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=247.3s)]
*  And that's obviously what's being discussed at this point. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=251.8s)]
*  But we are not even into day one of this operations getting chariots just yet. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=253.9s)]
*  In fact, as you mentioned earlier, it's supposed to start after President Trump leads the region next week. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=259.7s)]
*  So perhaps this is time for Hamas to actually want to negotiate some sort of ceasefire and release more hostages. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=264.59999999999997s)]
*  But certainly Israel is more than capable of taking over, conquering a territory like the Gaza Strip. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=270.5s)]
*  It has effectively done that since October 7th when Hamas launched the war and invasion against Israel. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=275.09999999999997s)]
*  And now it's a matter of holding territory, which also could lead to the next day after in Gaza. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=280.7s)]
*  But again, you know, the best thing for the Gaza people, for Israeli people and for the world is to defeat Hamas, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=286.7s)]
*  to see it rid of territory, to control. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=292.09999999999997s)]
*  And that's what this new strategy, this new operation seeks to do. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=294.4s)]
*  Hopefully the threat alone will get Hamas to the negotiating table. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=297.4s)]
*  Daniel, thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL9I6TqrXc&t=300.2s)]
