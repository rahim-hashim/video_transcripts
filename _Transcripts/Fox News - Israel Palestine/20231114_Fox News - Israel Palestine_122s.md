# IDF footage shows Israeli military raiding Hamas commander's headquarters
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqBYFydYNP0)
*  There's also this new video released by the IDF this morning showing troops [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqBYFydYNP0&t=0.0s)]
*  raiding a Hamas commander's headquarters. This, as Israeli forces say, two more [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqBYFydYNP0&t=5.2s)]
*  soldiers were killed during their ground operation into Gaza, bringing the total [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqBYFydYNP0&t=10.76s)]
*  dead to 47 soldiers. Israel says they will pause military activities in the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqBYFydYNP0&t=15.08s)]
*  Gaza City neighborhoods for several hours today so civilians can evacuate [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqBYFydYNP0&t=20.32s)]
*  south. Trey Yanks live in Israel with the very latest tray. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqBYFydYNP0&t=24.68s)]
*  Todd Carley, good morning. Battles rage on behind me inside the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqBYFydYNP0&t=27.68s)]
*  We you know Israeli forces are trying to push deeper into Gaza. You can hear some [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqBYFydYNP0&t=34.84s)]
*  of that gunfire in the distance. I'm going to just step out of the frame [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqBYFydYNP0&t=38.96s)]
*  here and you can listen to that. Much of the small arms that's taking place [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqBYFydYNP0&t=41.64s)]
*  along the border is a result of Hamas militants ambushing Israeli forces, the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqBYFydYNP0&t=46.68s)]
*  Israelis firing back. My cameraman here zoom me into what is an excavator [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqBYFydYNP0&t=52.04s)]
*  inside Gaza, an indication the Israelis are starting to dig up some of the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqBYFydYNP0&t=56.56s)]
*  tunnel entrances for Hamas that are being used to pop out and engage those [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqBYFydYNP0&t=61.32s)]
*  forces inside the strip. The Israelis say 47 of their soldiers have died [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqBYFydYNP0&t=66.44s)]
*  since the ground operation began 2.5 weeks ago. These intense battles [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqBYFydYNP0&t=70.12s)]
*  continue. You just hear that explosion there. Air strikes also against the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqBYFydYNP0&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  northern part of the strip, though much of the focused amid this ground [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqBYFydYNP0&t=78.08s)]
*  fighting remains on the Al Shefa Hospital in Gaza's largest city of Gaza [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqBYFydYNP0&t=81.28s)]
*  city. You want officials say dozens of premature babies, kidney patients and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqBYFydYNP0&t=85.72000000000001s)]
*  other vulnerable Palestinians are in desperate need of aid overnight. The [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqBYFydYNP0&t=89.84s)]
*  Israelis said they are preparing to deliver incubators to the hospital, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqBYFydYNP0&t=93.2s)]
*  though the issue appears to be access to power. The Hamas run health ministry [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqBYFydYNP0&t=96.56s)]
*  says more than 11,000 people have been killed in Gaza since this war began on [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqBYFydYNP0&t=100.56s)]
*  October 7th. We do know the Israelis are continuing to use artillery units [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqBYFydYNP0&t=105.0s)]
*  along the border and also their air force to support those infantry troops [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqBYFydYNP0&t=109.36000000000001s)]
*  inside the strip as those gun battles rage on behind me. Todd Carly. All [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqBYFydYNP0&t=113.4s)]
*  right, tray Yanks live for us in southern Israel. Trey, thank you for [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqBYFydYNP0&t=118.72s)]
*  that report. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqBYFydYNP0&t=121.44s)]
