# Hamas is not bound by law, rules: Former Israeli PM
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8)
*  For now, we want to have an important discussion with former Israeli prime minister, currently [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=0.0s)]
*  leading the opposition party in Israel, Yair Lapid. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=5.0s)]
*  Thank you so much, sir, for being with us. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=9.540000000000001s)]
*  Appreciate your time. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=11.4s)]
*  Yair Lapid, Israeli Prime Minister Thank you, Jackie. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=12.4s)]
*  Good to be saying thank you for having me. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=13.88s)]
*  Jackie DeVos Of course. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=15.96s)]
*  I want to ask you about this, the hostage negotiations and sort of the shift in rhetoric [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=16.96s)]
*  that we're hearing out of the U.S. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=21.72s)]
*  In the past couple of days, we've heard more vocally administration officials calling for [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=23.88s)]
*  a humanitarian pause in fighting to get the hostages out, if that can be achieved. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=30.0s)]
*  And we have seen somewhat of a delay in getting this ground operation fully underway. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=36.72s)]
*  Is there any daylight between the Israelis and the U.S. in terms of an appetite for a [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=43.72s)]
*  humanitarian pause? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=50.84s)]
*  Do you think that it's possible to get the hostages out and that you're dealing with [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=52.66s)]
*  anyone from the Hamas side who's acting in good faith in these negotiations? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=59.72s)]
*  Yair Lapid Nobody in Hamas is acting in good faith about [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=64.0s)]
*  anything. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=67.48s)]
*  They are just using the hostages as part of the human shield, the same way they're using [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=68.72s)]
*  their own people as human shield. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=73.88s)]
*  Among the people who were kidnapped is nine-month-old Kfir. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=76.72s)]
*  Do you think somebody who wouldn't hesitate to kidnap and abduct a nine-month-old baby [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=82.0s)]
*  is someone you can negotiate with reason with? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=88.44s)]
*  No. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=91.88s)]
*  What they're trying to do is just to be able to delay what we are doing in order to make [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=92.88s)]
*  sure Hamas loses his grounds and loses his military power while using babies and women [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=98.96s)]
*  and the elderly as human shield. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=107.52s)]
*  We're going to do everything in our power to release the hostages. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=110.44s)]
*  This is our duty to the people of Israel and, of course, to the families of the hostages. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=113.24s)]
*  But at the same time, we are not going to allow Hamas to get away with the massacre [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=118.44000000000001s)]
*  that they performed, and we cannot allow them to stay a military power on our border. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=123.24000000000001s)]
*  So, is what you're saying that Israel would not support a humanitarian pause in fighting? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=129.44s)]
*  What we're saying is we're going to tell them that if they want to stay alive, they will [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=136.12s)]
*  have to release every hostage they have in their hands. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=139.84s)]
*  Now, of course, some sort of negotiation will take place, and we will have to. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=142.8s)]
*  But what they're trying to do now is they're talking about the humanitarian pause. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=149.08s)]
*  What's humanitarian about the fact that they are holding hostages, babies, and women and [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=152.72s)]
*  the elderly? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=157.72s)]
*  They're just using this as they do because what they want is to be able to run away while [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=158.72s)]
*  leaving their own people behind. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=164.8s)]
*  Where do the negotiations stand for the hostage releases? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=167.56s)]
*  We haven't gotten much of an indication that there's been progress there for a few days. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=170.0s)]
*  What can you tell us about anything on the table or the level of engagement right now? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=175.12s)]
*  Well, this is pretty difficult because you're dealing, you're not dealing with regular human [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=181.12s)]
*  beings. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=186.28s)]
*  You're dealing with a terror organization that doesn't bound to any civil law or civilized [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=187.28s)]
*  rules. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=193.72s)]
*  And then again, we're working opposite them through third parties, the Qataris, the Egyptians, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=196.12s)]
*  and so on and so forth, trying to find ways to release the hostage. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  I don't want to go into further details more than that. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=209.12s)]
*  Understandable. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  And I also want to ask you about the warning that Israel sent to journalists in Gaza saying [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=213.0s)]
*  that Israel could not guarantee the safety of journalists that are operating within Gaza. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=218.4s)]
*  Does that at all reflect on an inability to keep or I guess ensure the safety of hostages [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=225.5s)]
*  also who are in Gaza or the civilians, many of whom are Israeli, that are being held in [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=232.66s)]
*  Gaza? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=238.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=239.66s)]
*  What is happening, of course, Israel is all for free press and even the ability of journalists [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=240.66s)]
*  to work during wartime. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=246.74s)]
*  Hamas is doing is trying to prevent our military operation while using everybody, their own [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=249.74s)]
*  people, their own children, our children, the hostages, and the journalists as human [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=256.86s)]
*  shield. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=261.3s)]
*  This is monstrous. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=262.3s)]
*  This is preposterous. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=263.3s)]
*  This is against any rule of engagement we know. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=264.3s)]
*  And this is the way terror organizations are operating. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=269.58s)]
*  The thing is, again, we will do everything in our power in order to make sure journalists [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=273.74s)]
*  will be able to do their work, because this is part of what functioning democracy is all [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=279.22s)]
*  about. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=284.78000000000003s)]
*  At the same time, they have to understand we are fighting people who have no rules and [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=285.78000000000003s)]
*  have no laws and are not bound to anything. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=289.98s)]
*  And they will shoot journalists if they will think this will go as a good headline in Word's [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=293.26s)]
*  press. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=299.90000000000003s)]
*  So they have to be careful, and we just warn them about the risks and perils in the war [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=300.9s)]
*  zone when you're fighting a terror organization. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=305.97999999999996s)]
*  Of course, Israel has been putting out a lot of information, warnings to anybody in Gaza [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=308.82s)]
*  about the need to get out and using a lot of different methods to try to spread that [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=314.02s)]
*  information. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=318.14s)]
*  But, sir, I also want to ask you about something that you said a couple of days ago about the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=319.14s)]
*  functioning of the Israeli government right now and whether or not it's doing enough for [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=324.26s)]
*  Israelis, many of whom are needing more support from the government. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=330.26s)]
*  You raised the issue about public communications, care for evacuated citizens, need to help [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=335.90000000000003s)]
*  small and medium businesses who have had their owners or their workers called up as reservists, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=342.58s)]
*  expanding financial protections for frontline residents and folks who are being called up [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=349.82s)]
*  to serve right now in the military. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=354.86s)]
*  What is your assessment of how the government is doing right now? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=357.58s)]
*  Well, you know, it's delicate and complicated at the same time. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=363.97999999999996s)]
*  You don't want to be too, to criticize the government too much in a time of war. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=370.02s)]
*  We are all united in the war effort. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=374.26s)]
*  On the other hand, there is still a country that you have to run in the meantime. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=377.09999999999997s)]
*  I mean, I've, it's, there's no real textbook of how should an opposition leader or the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=381.86s)]
*  opposition in general act during a war time. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=389.3s)]
*  So I'm supporting the government and I'm supporting, of course, the Israeli troops and our brave [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=393.86s)]
*  soldiers in this war. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=398.22s)]
*  In the meantime, what we're trying to do is to make sure that the Israeli citizens are [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=399.54s)]
*  getting a better service from the government, even in a time of war. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=403.7s)]
*  And on this, having not a critical voice, but the ability to criticize is important. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=408.74s)]
*  And this is what we do. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=416.58s)]
*  We are, well, more than, the thing we do is we're just pointing to the government, the [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=417.58s)]
*  weak spots in the way the country is helping its citizens in a time of pain and sorrow [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=422.62s)]
*  and difficulty. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=432.18s)]
*  Have any of your suggestions been adopted at all by the government? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=433.86s)]
*  Yes, actually, yes. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=438.42s)]
*  We have a dialogue with them. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=440.02000000000004s)]
*  We have discussing this. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=441.22s)]
*  I told them, I said, listen, we are in this together. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=442.34000000000003s)]
*  It is not like this is not the usual coalition opposition time or stage. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=445.54s)]
*  This is different. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=452.02000000000004s)]
*  We have our areas of expertise. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=453.66s)]
*  You have yours. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=456.54s)]
*  Let's work together. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=457.54s)]
*  And we are working together. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=458.54s)]
*  They took not everything, but enough to convince me in the goodwill. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=460.86s)]
*  And we're going to keep on working together. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=467.62s)]
*  And last question for you, Prime Minister. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=469.5s)]
*  What is your assessment of where the U.S. support for Israel stands right now? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=471.22s)]
*  Obviously, President Biden has been vocally and unwaveringly behind the state of Israel [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=476.46000000000004s)]
*  as it seeks to root out Hamas, defend itself from future attacks on its people. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=482.34000000000003s)]
*  We have heard more vocal support for things like humanitarian pauses that the Israelis [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=488.9s)]
*  don't seem to be really embracing right now. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=496.38s)]
*  We've heard suggestions, recommendations of a delay in this ground operation. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=498.74s)]
*  How closely are the U.S. and Israel aligned right now? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=505.58s)]
*  And is there any daylight between your government and President Biden? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=511.82s)]
*  Well, it's as close as it gets. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=517.18s)]
*  And it's not only with the administration. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=518.78s)]
*  It's I am everybody so happy and pleased with the fact it's a bipartisan support. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=520.7s)]
*  I mean, in a world that is getting more and more polarized, the fact that we have this [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=527.98s)]
*  bipartisan support that just had a few days ago, a delegation of senators from both sides [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=531.74s)]
*  of the aisle here. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=536.54s)]
*  And of course, I'm talking to all my friends in Congress, in Senate and on the Hill. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=538.02s)]
*  And this is extremely important to the people of Israel. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=544.02s)]
*  Now, we have discussed some of the issues you have mentioned. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=547.66s)]
*  It is not true that Israel is against anything that is humanitarian. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=550.82s)]
*  We have no fight with the people of Gaza. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=553.94s)]
*  We have a fight with Hamas, with the organization that is torturing both Israelis and Palestinians [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=556.66s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=562.1s)]
*  And the administration understands this and work very closely with us. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=563.02s)]
*  I've been in this game for a long time. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=568.0600000000001s)]
*  I don't remember this level of coordination and cooperation as we have right now with [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=570.46s)]
*  the United States. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=575.14s)]
*  And the people of Israel are thankful and even emotional about this. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=576.6600000000001s)]
*  Thank you so much for your time, sir. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCr0noJan8&t=584.3000000000001s)]
