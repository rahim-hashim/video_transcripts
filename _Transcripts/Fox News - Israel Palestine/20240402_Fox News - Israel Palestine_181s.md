**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSEY08mrYE)
*  And breaking right now protesters reportedly heading for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's private home in Jerusalem [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSEY08mrYE&t=0.0s)]
*  as Iran says that Israel will be punished after a deadly attack on an Iranian consulate in Syria [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSEY08mrYE&t=6.8s)]
*  that took out one of the leaders of these militia groups, an Iranian leader. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSEY08mrYE&t=14.8s)]
*  So Israel has not confirmed that that strike came on their behalf. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSEY08mrYE&t=19.3s)]
*  Correspondent Trey Yanks joins us now on all of this breaking news in Israel. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSEY08mrYE&t=24.6s)]
*  Good afternoon. Hi Trey. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSEY08mrYE&t=29.4s)]
*  Hey Martha, good afternoon. I do want to start with this breaking news out of Jerusalem. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSEY08mrYE&t=31.4s)]
*  I just spoke with someone on the phone who is in the city indicating that there are police outside of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSEY08mrYE&t=35.9s)]
*  and they are currently clashing with demonstrators. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSEY08mrYE&t=45.9s)]
*  These protesters took to the streets over the past 72 hours to demonstrate against the government, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSEY08mrYE&t=48.900000000000006s)]
*  call for new elections and for a ceasefire agreement to get the hostages out of Gaza. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSEY08mrYE&t=55.0s)]
*  According to the person I spoke with on the phone, police are using water cannons and horses to disperse the crowd that is currently gathered in Jerusalem. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSEY08mrYE&t=60.5s)]
*  We'll continue to follow that story. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSEY08mrYE&t=69.3s)]
*  It comes as Israel is facing new threats and pressure from the Islamic Republic. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSEY08mrYE&t=70.9s)]
*  Following a strike yesterday in Damascus, Syria that we understand killed seven members of Iran's IRGC, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSEY08mrYE&t=76.1s)]
*  including two top generals. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSEY08mrYE&t=82.89999999999999s)]
*  Overnight in Tehran protesters gathered in the streets burning both American and Israeli flags. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSEY08mrYE&t=85.0s)]
*  They chanted death to America and called on their own government to respond. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSEY08mrYE&t=91.2s)]
*  Iranian officials echoed these calls today with the country's supreme leader posting to X saying, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSEY08mrYE&t=95.8s)]
*  quote, we will make the Zionists regret this crime of attacking the Iranian consulate in Syria and other crimes like this by God's power and strength. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSEY08mrYE&t=101.0s)]
*  Iranian President Ibrahim Raisi also said the attack would not go unanswered in the past. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSEY08mrYE&t=110.0s)]
*  Iran has threatened harsh responses and then done nothing. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSEY08mrYE&t=115.3s)]
*  But given the current state of affairs, Israeli forces are currently on high alert. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSEY08mrYE&t=118.4s)]
*  We're also following one final developing story out of the Middle East today overnight. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSEY08mrYE&t=123.2s)]
*  A series of Israeli strikes in Gaza killed seven members of the World Central Kitchen. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSEY08mrYE&t=127.1s)]
*  Among the dead are numerous foreign citizens, including one American graphic video circulated online of bodies [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSEY08mrYE&t=132.3s)]
*  at a local hospital inside Gaza. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSEY08mrYE&t=139.7s)]
*  Some of these individuals still wearing protective gear. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSEY08mrYE&t=141.89999999999998s)]
*  They were inside of an armored car when the explosions occurred. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSEY08mrYE&t=144.6s)]
*  The Israelis say they are taking credit for the strikes, calling them tragic and unintentional. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSEY08mrYE&t=148.29999999999998s)]
*  Israel says they will conduct a thorough investigation into what happened last night and make those findings public. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSEY08mrYE&t=153.2s)]
*  Martha, it's a real tragedy indeed. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSEY08mrYE&t=159.7s)]
