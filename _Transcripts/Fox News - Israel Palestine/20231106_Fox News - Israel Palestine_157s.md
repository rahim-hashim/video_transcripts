# Israeli forces strike southern Lebanon
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klmAWPj73yE)
*  But first to Trey Yanks, live on the ground in southern Israel. Trey, heavy fighting all [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klmAWPj73yE&t=0.0s)]
*  morning where you are. Also, I got to say, I'm super impressed with how you embedded with the IDF. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klmAWPj73yE&t=4.4s)]
*  That was a great journalistic achievement. What's the latest from where you are? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klmAWPj73yE&t=10.8s)]
*  Yeah, John, thank you. This afternoon and into the evening has been yet another day of fighting [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klmAWPj73yE&t=17.04s)]
*  between Israeli forces and Hamas militants inside the Gaza Strip. It does come as we have some [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klmAWPj73yE&t=22.56s)]
*  breaking news from the north. The Israelis say right now they are striking southern Lebanon [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klmAWPj73yE&t=28.159999999999997s)]
*  after 30 rockets were fired into northern Israel today. And Hamas actually took credit for this [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klmAWPj73yE&t=32.48s)]
*  rocket fire, despite the fact that there must be a sign off from Hezbollah when any sort of fire [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klmAWPj73yE&t=37.76s)]
*  like this takes place into northern Israel. But behind me, along the Gaza Strip, I do want to [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klmAWPj73yE&t=42.32s)]
*  show you some video from last night. You can see just how massive these explosions are as the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klmAWPj73yE&t=46.959999999999994s)]
*  Israelis use bunker buster bombs to try to target some of the tunnel infrastructure beneath the Gaza [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klmAWPj73yE&t=51.84s)]
*  Strip. Off in the distance there, you can hear some of that outgoing artillery still taking place [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klmAWPj73yE&t=57.2s)]
*  right now. This does come after we embedded with the Israeli military this weekend, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klmAWPj73yE&t=61.52s)]
*  getting a firsthand look at the battles between Israel and Hamas. Take a look. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klmAWPj73yE&t=66.8s)]
*  You can hear that gunfire in the distance. The Israelis are trying to engage [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klmAWPj73yE&t=75.44s)]
*  anyone who tries to ambush their forces. And the battle is street by street. It is urban [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klmAWPj73yE&t=79.44s)]
*  guerrilla warfare as Hamas is popping out of tunnels and ambushing Israeli troops. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klmAWPj73yE&t=85.44s)]
*  Right now we're embedded with the Israeli military inside the Gaza Strip. These forces have been [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klmAWPj73yE&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  ambushed, shot at, and lost more than two dozen of their own soldiers. Still, they fight block by block [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klmAWPj73yE&t=99.6s)]
*  in bloody urban battle. Their enemy, Hamas, guerrilla fighters popping out of tunnels and [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klmAWPj73yE&t=106.39999999999999s)]
*  trying to kill as many of the Israelis as they can. Now today, Hamas's Al-Qassam Brigades released [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klmAWPj73yE&t=112.0s)]
*  a video of that exact firefight. And you could see what the perspective looked like from their end. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klmAWPj73yE&t=120.32s)]
*  And they were using RPGs that are advanced weaponry, the weaponry used to penetrate armor. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klmAWPj73yE&t=126.08s)]
*  And that's exactly what's been taking place. These Hamas fighters are ambushing the Israelis [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klmAWPj73yE&t=132.32s)]
*  inside the Strip as they've surrounded Gaza City. And we do expect them to move deeper into Gaza [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klmAWPj73yE&t=136.48s)]
*  in the coming hours and days. Again, the focus here for the Israeli military is to first try [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klmAWPj73yE&t=141.84s)]
*  to identify where those hostages are being held underneath Gaza City and second, destroy Hamas [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klmAWPj73yE&t=146.56s)]
*  leadership. John? All right, Trey Yngst from southern Israel with the very latest on that. Trey, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klmAWPj73yE&t=152.0s)]
*  thank you so much. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klmAWPj73yE&t=156.64000000000001s)]
