# 65-year-old hostage held by Hamas found dead in Gaza: IDF
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw)
*  Fox News digital capturing the emotional moment that an Israeli man in New York City stands [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=0.0s)]
*  before a poster of his own brother who Hamas is holding hostage. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=5.68s)]
*  While people fight for the safe return of their loved ones, some people are ripping [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=10.0s)]
*  down the posters and protesting against Israel. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=14.1s)]
*  Let's bring in the president of Media Line, the American news agency covering Israel and [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=18.2s)]
*  the Middle East, Felice Freidsen. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=21.76s)]
*  Felice, thank you for being with us. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=23.2s)]
*  First of all, let me get your reaction to the sad news that Yehuda Weiss, mother of [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=25.08s)]
*  five in her 60s, whose husband was murdered in her safe room on October the 7th in Kibbutz [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=30.24s)]
*  Berry, she was taken hostage by Hamas, was found deceased today by the IDF. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=36.16s)]
*  It indeed is very sad and thank you so much for having me today. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=43.08s)]
*  I was with members from Kibbutz Berry recently and I have to say it's a very sad day here [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  in Israel to find out that this 65 year old woman who was a cancer patient was found dead. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=53.8s)]
*  It also leaves questions about where all the hostages are at the moment in Gaza. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=59.8s)]
*  The families are feeling very worried about their loved ones. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=64.36s)]
*  As you can imagine, it's more than 40 days into this Israel-Gaza war. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=67.2s)]
*  And we're showing a picture of Yehuda Weiss there, 65 years of age. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=73.72s)]
*  The IDF did not say how she died or when she died, only that her body had been found [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=79.24s)]
*  and returned to Israel for dignified burial. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=84.08s)]
*  I want to go back to where we started at the top of this and that was a picture of Michael [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=86.96s)]
*  Levy, who's an Israeli who's in New York City, who found a picture of his brother Or Levy, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=90.64s)]
*  who has been held by Hamas since October the 7th on a billboard in New York City. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=97.52s)]
*  Let's listen to what he said when he described to FoxNews.com what it was like to see his [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=102.84s)]
*  brother's picture up there. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=107.8s)]
*  Watching him here is surreal. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=110.36s)]
*  I wonder what he'll think when he'll find out that his poster, his picture was everywhere. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  His poster is there in New York City showing so many people support the return of these [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=126.52s)]
*  hostages. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=131.88s)]
*  It really was a touching moment. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=132.88s)]
*  The hostage organization behind this has done an incredible job of really enlightening the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=135.4s)]
*  world of what's happening with all these families. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=140.04s)]
*  And the numbers, you know, they've come out with 239 as the number of hostages still that [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=143.16s)]
*  are being held in Gaza. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=148.12s)]
*  It's very still hard. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=149.12s)]
*  It's hard to still know if that's correct because of so many that are still missing. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=150.12s)]
*  But quite honestly, what he's saying is in the hearts of every one of these people. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=154.36s)]
*  I was in Kibbutz Be'erian and spoke with so many of them, including Thomas Hand, one of [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=158.72s)]
*  the hostage fathers that you had on recently. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=163.32s)]
*  And Thomas Hand telling me that he was happy to hear that his daughter was killed and not [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=167.56s)]
*  in the hands of Hamas. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=171.6s)]
*  And then we learned as I was putting together a documentary on the burning hearts in Be'erian [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=173.4s)]
*  that there was a possibility that she's alive and that the Israel Defense Forces told him [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=178.76s)]
*  so. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=182.84s)]
*  So I can't quite imagine what he's going through. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=183.84s)]
*  But quite frankly, John, what's important here to note is those posters you talk about, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=185.82s)]
*  too, many people are ripping them down as well. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=189.95999999999998s)]
*  And I think that the reality is that many people have lost their soul in this war. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=194.2s)]
*  It's really a war of civilizations of understanding what is good and what is bad. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=199.23999999999998s)]
*  And this was just evil at its core. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=203.85999999999999s)]
*  And yet we had that touching moment on Tuesday, that moment of silence for all of the hostages [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=205.98s)]
*  here on the Mall in Washington. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=210.62s)]
*  Felice Friedsen, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=212.26s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMO6bqpysNw&t=214.1s)]
