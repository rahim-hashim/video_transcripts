# How are universities miseducating students amid pro-terror protests?
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [September 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA)
*  Ken Marcus is the founder and chairman of the Lewis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=0.0s)]
*  Under Law. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  Ken, always good to see you. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Do you expect that the universities have now turned a new page? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=7.16s)]
*  Will they control these demonstrations more? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=10.92s)]
*  Do you expect a simmering down of this, or have they not learned their lesson? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=14.0s)]
*  Good to be with you again, Eric. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=19.64s)]
*  Unfortunately, I do not believe that they have learned their lesson. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=21.36s)]
*  The problem is not just about protest. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=24.52s)]
*  Everyone has a right to speak freely. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=27.36s)]
*  The problem is with criminality, whether it's vandalism or assault and battery. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=29.6s)]
*  Some colleges have done relatively well when it comes to what's called time, place, or [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=34.96s)]
*  manner restrictions. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=40.6s)]
*  Others haven't done well at all. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=42.08s)]
*  But even the best of them are merely managing symptoms. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=44.24s)]
*  None of them is addressing the underlying disease. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  None of them is addressing how it is these institutions have come to the place where [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=50.68000000000001s)]
*  Students want to carry flags of a terrorist organization like Hamas. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=56.16s)]
*  It's not just a question of whether the students will engage in vandalism. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  It's a question of how these universities are miseducating the students to the point [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=65.39999999999999s)]
*  where this is considered to be normal. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=69.64s)]
*  What are they doing wrong? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=72.47999999999999s)]
*  I mean, we had 13 federal judges have announced they're not going to accept Columbia University [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=73.47999999999999s)]
*  law students as their law clerks because they say basically Columbia is not properly educating [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=78.64s)]
*  the future leaders of our country. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=84.03999999999999s)]
*  What is it that's wrong in their curriculum, and what should they do to change that? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=86.08s)]
*  And the judges are right to say that. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=90.16s)]
*  Look, there are some universities that are doing some things right that should be replicated [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  elsewhere. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=95.8s)]
*  Virginia public universities are relatively good, for example, instituting bans on masking [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=96.8s)]
*  in public places, instituting rules regarding the definition of anti-Semitism. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  We've seen New York University done a good job of explaining that sometimes restrictions [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=108.0s)]
*  on Zionists mean a restriction on Jews, and that should be considered discrimination. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=112.78s)]
*  But at many universities, including Columbia, we see Middle East studies professors and [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=117.88s)]
*  others who are misusing the curricula in ways that propagandize anti-Zionism and sometimes [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=122.42s)]
*  anti-Americanism. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=129.78s)]
*  When you have year after year of students being indoctrinated into anti-Semitism, you [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=131.44s)]
*  shouldn't be surprised when the students start listening and acting in ways, sometimes [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=136.58s)]
*  that are actually consistent with the teaching. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=141.98s)]
*  Here's what the acting interim president of Columbia, Katrina Anderson Armstrong, says, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=144.82s)]
*  saying, quote, President Armstrong says, I deeply believe in the values of free speech, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=150.38s)]
*  open inquiry, and rigorous debate, but those rights cannot come at the expense of the rights [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=156.14s)]
*  of others to live, work, and learn here. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=160.7s)]
*  Free from discrimination and harassment, our rules have been devised with this balance [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=163.22s)]
*  in mind. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=167.98s)]
*  But after, I mean, there's this shocking 91-page report at Columbia that showed that [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=168.98s)]
*  students were chased, Jewish students, Jewish students at Columbia chased in dorms, spat [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=173.85999999999999s)]
*  on, pushed, you know, pushed to the ground that they were attacked, Israeli flags burned, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=179.5s)]
*  and this sort of thing. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=185.85999999999999s)]
*  Do you think that some of these students and activists will listen? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=186.85999999999999s)]
*  We know that they won't, and give Columbia some credit for a report that gives transparency [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=192.5s)]
*  to what the students have been facing. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=198.42s)]
*  The fact is that there are students facing similar problems at many colleges and universities [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=200.1s)]
*  around the country. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=204.42s)]
*  But while the report is good at providing transparency about the horrendous problems, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=205.86s)]
*  students being harassed, spit on, jewelry pulled off, it's much weaker when it comes [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=211.66s)]
*  to finding very specific solutions to what they're going to do on that campus. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=218.6s)]
*  This is not what we're seeing at Columbia, and it's not what we're seeing elsewhere. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=223.74s)]
*  And finally, Ken, your thoughts. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=226.82s)]
*  September 11th is next Wednesday, and on Thursday one of the activist groups is calling on September [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=229.02s)]
*  12th, is calling for a national day of action saying the intifada continues, the day after [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=234.62s)]
*  9-11. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=240.66s)]
*  What's your reflections on this? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=241.66s)]
*  Listen, if anything, we need to make sure that we use this commemorative or remembrance [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=244.58s)]
*  day to remind ourselves not to look aside and to realize that what we learned on October [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=251.98s)]
*  7 is that there is evil in this world and even in this country that we hadn't realized. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=258.42s)]
*  We need to take the opportunity to remember it and to take action. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=264.09999999999997s)]
*  The fact that there are some who are obscenely celebrating the anniversary of October 7 should [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=267.82s)]
*  redouble our resolve, not just to make a few speeches or statements, but actually to look [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=273.82s)]
*  inward and to ask the question, why is it that we tolerate institutions that continue [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=281.08000000000004s)]
*  to teach anti-Zionism, anti-Americanism, and hate, creating another generation that will [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=286.84000000000003s)]
*  not only be anti-Jewish, but will be unreliable when it comes to the question of how can they [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=293.48s)]
*  take on the responsibilities of citizenship? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=301.6s)]
*  Our democracy is at stake when students are being taught to love Hamas and to hate our [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=304.26s)]
*  friends around the world. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=310.86s)]
*  Ken Marcus, who's been working on this issue diligently for the past year plus and is dedicated [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=312.98s)]
*  to this. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=318.94s)]
*  Ken, good to see you. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2f8qV5EZA&t=319.94s)]
