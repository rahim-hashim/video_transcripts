# Hamas militants given 'chilling' instructions with remaining hostages
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [September 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA)
*  Chief Foreign Correspondent Trey Yanks live in Tel Aviv with a chilling new report on [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=0.0s)]
*  Hamas' new directive for the remaining hostages. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=5.3s)]
*  Trey? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=8.34s)]
*  Yeah, Todd Carley, good morning. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=9.34s)]
*  The psychological warfare of Hamas continues. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=12.3s)]
*  Overnight, the group released a statement from their military spokesman Abel Abayda [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=15.5s)]
*  saying that militants guarding the hostages in Gaza had been given new instructions about [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=21.14s)]
*  what to do if Israeli forces approach. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=25.82s)]
*  They insinuated that more hostages would be killed if the IDF tries to rescue them. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=28.84s)]
*  Now the statement came after the funeral was held for American citizen Hirsch Goldberg [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=34.08s)]
*  Pollin in Jerusalem. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=38.0s)]
*  Thousands of people lined the streets to pay their respects as his parents eulogized their son. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=39.76s)]
*  Once again, Hamas tried to pressure Israel during this time by releasing a new video [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  showing the hostages alive. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=49.22s)]
*  After the execution of these six Israeli hostages, there are new questions about how the war will end. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=51.260000000000005s)]
*  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke overnight at a press conference. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=57.02s)]
*  He made clear he's not willing to compromise on the issue of the Philadelphia Corridor, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=60.82s)]
*  a strip of land between Gaza and Egypt where Israeli troops are currently deployed. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=65.14s)]
*  The Israeli leader adding this. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=69.7s)]
*  Citizens of Israel, we are in the middle of an existential war. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=72.9s)]
*  The first condition for victory in this existential war is the security of our security and unity. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=78.62s)]
*  We have to stand together as one person against a cruel enemy who wants to destroy all of us. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=89.48s)]
*  All of us without any exception. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=95.96000000000001s)]
*  Overnight, I received a statement from a senior Hamas official who blamed Israel and America [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=100.52000000000001s)]
*  for the deaths of these hostages, but they provided no evidence. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=105.52s)]
*  And it gives you a sense of where Hamas stands on actually wanting to end the war. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  They would rather threaten Israel and the remaining hostages than make a deal at the negotiating table. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=113.64s)]
*  Todd, Karla. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=118.88s)]
*  Good point. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=119.64s)]
*  Trey Yanks live for us in Israel. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=120.14s)]
*  Trey, thank you so much. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  Let's bring in Dan Hoffman, who is a former CIA station chief. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=123.44s)]
*  He joins me now. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=126.36s)]
*  Dan, good morning to you. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=127.47999999999999s)]
*  The murder of these six hostages, it's just the ultimate gut punch. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=129.44s)]
*  And it's something that I think a lot of people are thinking about throughout their day and just wishing so deeply that there was a different outcome. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=133.24s)]
*  And yesterday, President Biden was asked if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is doing enough to bring these hostages home. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=141.16s)]
*  And he said no. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=147.16s)]
*  So what about that? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  Is he not doing enough? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=150.24s)]
*  And if so, what more could Israel be doing? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=151.56s)]
*  Yeah, look, it's tragic that we lost these six hostages. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=156.88s)]
*  And Hamas is obviously responsible. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=161.56s)]
*  They're a terrorist group, and this is what they do. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=163.84s)]
*  And Hamas, look, they're going to lose every single tactical battle in Gaza, but they are winning the narrative, as we see on the streets of New York right now. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=166.4s)]
*  They knew Hamas knew that by killing these six hostages, that they would drive up the pressure on Prime Minister Netanyahu, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=176.36s)]
*  that they would drive up the pressure within the Democratic Party on our support for Israel. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=182.96s)]
*  And I think that's behind this. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=187.52s)]
*  It's also what was behind Hamas releasing those gruesome videos after they brutally murdered innocent Israeli civilians on October 7. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=188.84s)]
*  They wanted Israel to invade Gaza, and they knew that it would result in the deaths of innocent Palestinians [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=196.92000000000002s)]
*  because Hamas is deliberately embedding themselves with those with those Palestinians. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=203.28s)]
*  And that would also serve their narrative. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=208.96s)]
*  And that's sadly what we're seeing playing out right now. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=211.12s)]
*  But look, they're a terrorist group. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=214.28s)]
*  Benjamin, Prime Minister Netanyahu knows something about negotiating, even with the terrorist group. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=216.2s)]
*  And back in 2011, he gave up a thousand Palestinians in order to get back one Israeli soldier. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=220.4s)]
*  So it kind of stretches the bounds, I think, of realism to say that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not doing all that's possible to to gain their release. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=229.56s)]
*  Israel's mounted a number of raids to release hostages. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  But again, negotiating with a terrorist group, that's just extraordinarily difficult and it's not going to result in what we would like to see. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=243.4s)]
*  Yeah, you know, Dan, about the messaging war, it's true. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=252.48000000000002s)]
*  And even the phrasing of the question that the president received yesterday is notable where the reporter asked, is Benjamin Netanyahu doing enough? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=254.84s)]
*  Not is Hamas doing enough to come to the negotiating table and end the war? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=262.48s)]
*  And as you and Trayvill said, it's because this is a war that Hamas wants. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=266.76s)]
*  They want to win this messaging and narrative war. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=271.04s)]
*  And so far they have Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under so much pressure, not just from the United States, but also in his own country. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=274.32s)]
*  There have been protests over the weekend. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=283.0s)]
*  The UK is now withholding weapons. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=285.48s)]
*  So what do you think he does next? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=288.64s)]
*  Do you think he signs a ceasefire deal? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=291.4s)]
*  And if so, and Hamas is remained intact, could another October 7th happen down the road? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=294.12s)]
*  That's the challenge we face how this ends. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=302.0s)]
*  And what Hamas wants is a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=304.28s)]
*  They want a full ceasefire as well, so that even though Hamas, which has been degraded, will be able to remain in power in Gaza. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=308.84s)]
*  That's what they want after all of this. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=317.48s)]
*  And Israel cannot allow that to happen. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=319.88s)]
*  And so I think that's the challenge we face going forward. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=321.96s)]
*  I don't see Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu giving up on that. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=324.92s)]
*  But the challenge for Israel as well is that is the amount of time that this has taken and former President Trump has emphasized that as well. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=329.12s)]
*  We're looking at almost a year of hostilities in Gaza. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=337.4s)]
*  And the longer this goes on, I will say the more that it serves Hamas's ability to drive the narrative and make it difficult for Israel internally, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=340.47999999999996s)]
*  because we've seen protests there as well as for the United States and the United Kingdom. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=349.15999999999997s)]
*  And that's what Hamas is trying to do, to hang on and increase the pressure by driving the narrative that they've successfully been able to do thus far. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=354.52s)]
*  Well, yesterday, the prime minister said, my heart and the hearts of the nation is broken into segments, into fragments. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=363.16s)]
*  Hamas will pay a very heavy price for this, meaning the six murdered innocent hostages. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=368.44s)]
*  We'll see. We'll wait and see what that heavy price will be. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=375.84s)]
*  Dan, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPJ1SACeTwA&t=378.28s)]
