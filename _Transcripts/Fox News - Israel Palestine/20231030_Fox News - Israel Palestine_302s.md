# These people are not humanitarians, they’re the opposite of that: Netanyahu adviser
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs)
*  All right, Sandra, let's bring in Ambassador Mark Regev, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=0.0s)]
*  Senior Advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=2.44s)]
*  and the former Israeli ambassador to the UK. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=4.78s)]
*  Mark, it's good to catch up with you. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=6.8s)]
*  It's been a while since you and I have chatted. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=8.58s)]
*  Good to see you, John. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=9.78s)]
*  Wanted to ask you about the good news [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=11.24s)]
*  regarding Private Ori Megidish. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=15.02s)]
*  Can you give us any details [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=18.16s)]
*  on how she was rescued overnight? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=19.76s)]
*  I can only tell you it was a special operations [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=22.82s)]
*  combined with our elite forces [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=25.900000000000002s)]
*  together with intelligence, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=28.94s)]
*  Israel's Shin Bet, which has assets on the ground. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=31.94s)]
*  And we're very glad that she's at home, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=35.72s)]
*  that she's safe, that she's healthy, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=37.38s)]
*  and she's with her family. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=38.82s)]
*  I think all Israelis are celebrating [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=40.18s)]
*  the fact that she was rescued. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=42.42s)]
*  The fact that she was rescued in a military operation, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=44.38s)]
*  does it give you some hope that other hostages [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=47.02s)]
*  may be able to be freed by the IDF [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=50.5s)]
*  without negotiations with Hamas? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=53.6s)]
*  First of all, I hope so. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=57.34s)]
*  Obviously, there'll be a major effort underway, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=59.040000000000006s)]
*  but we have to restate the uncomfortable truth [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=61.040000000000006s)]
*  that we're dealing with a brutal, horrific enemy. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=64.54s)]
*  They're extremists, they're barbaric. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=69.02000000000001s)]
*  We saw the violence they're capable of. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=70.78s)]
*  These people, they're not humanitarians. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  They're the opposite of that. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=76.16s)]
*  And we have to understand the people that we are dealing with. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  And the people who are people who are being held hostage, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=81.5s)]
*  they are in terrible danger. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=85.55999999999999s)]
*  And while we'll make a maximum effort to get them out, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=88.41999999999999s)]
*  we have to do our best, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=91.96s)]
*  but it's a formidable circumstance. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=94.16s)]
*  On the subject of negotiations, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=96.83999999999999s)]
*  our Trey Yengst was reporting [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=98.83999999999999s)]
*  that senior Israeli officials met with Qatari officials [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=100.64s)]
*  over the weekend to try to push forward [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  the idea of the release of at least some hostages. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=107.13999999999999s)]
*  Where do those negotiations stand now? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=109.88s)]
*  John, I can't go into that. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=112.8s)]
*  I can only say that the idea of trying to get them out [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=114.03999999999999s)]
*  is at the top of our agenda. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  We believe that the military operation [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=123.38s)]
*  and keeping the pressure up on Hamas [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  is a way to facilitate their release. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=127.02s)]
*  We think that diplomatic pressure on Hamas' friends, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=129.62s)]
*  their allies in the Middle East, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=133.06s)]
*  that's another way of getting them out. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=134.51999999999998s)]
*  And that combination is going to get us [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=135.72s)]
*  more people out in the end. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=138.6s)]
*  Yeah, I just want to point out, Mark, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=140.56s)]
*  as we're speaking, we're showing this display there in Israel [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=141.88s)]
*  of the empty beds representing all of the hostages [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=146.86s)]
*  who are still in Hamas' custody. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=149.7s)]
*  Our old friend Dennis Ross, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=152.5s)]
*  on the subject of an Israeli ceasefire [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=154.7s)]
*  with mounting international pressure on Israel, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=156.74s)]
*  wrote something in the New York Times. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=159.74s)]
*  It's significant coming from Ross because, as you know, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=161.64s)]
*  he probably has done more than any other American diplomat [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=164.84s)]
*  to try to achieve peace between Israel and the Palestinians. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=168.16000000000003s)]
*  He wrote this, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=171.44000000000003s)]
*  In the past, I might have favored a ceasefire with Hamas [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=173.10000000000002s)]
*  during a conflict with Israel. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=175.64000000000001s)]
*  But today, it is clear to me that peace [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=177.68s)]
*  is not going to be possible now or in the future [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=179.88000000000002s)]
*  as long as Hamas remains intact and in control of Gaza. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=183.02s)]
*  Hamas' powered ability to threaten Israel [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=186.18s)]
*  and subject Gazan civilians [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=188.36s)]
*  to ever more rounds of violence must end. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=191.32000000000002s)]
*  Coming from Dennis Ross, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  I mean, that is a pretty definitive statement [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=196.84s)]
*  that the situation on the ground has to change [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=199.07999999999998s)]
*  because he has always held out hope [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=201.67999999999998s)]
*  that there's a peaceful solution here. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=204.28s)]
*  He doesn't see one in this case. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=206.12s)]
*  Well, I think we all have to understand [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=209.32s)]
*  that anyone who wants to see peace in the Middle East [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=211.2s)]
*  has to see that Hamas is a major problem. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=213.79999999999998s)]
*  They're going to oppose any peace. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=216.44s)]
*  They're going to oppose any reconciliation. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=218.29999999999998s)]
*  I mean, they say openly, yes, that the Jewish state, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=221.04s)]
*  my country, has no right to a peace. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=223.88s)]
*  My country has no right to exist, not in any borders. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=225.96s)]
*  They say openly that any Arab leader [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=228.64s)]
*  who negotiates with Israel is a traitor to Islam [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=230.94s)]
*  and a traitor to the Arab world. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=233.6s)]
*  And John, you know what? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=235.48s)]
*  They believe it has to be done to traitors. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  And finally, they say every Jew, every Israeli [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=238.84s)]
*  is a legitimate target for murder, for their terrorism. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=241.32s)]
*  These people oppose peace and reconciliation. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=244.32s)]
*  And anyone who wants to see a better [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=248.01999999999998s)]
*  and more peaceful Middle East has to support Israel [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=249.56s)]
*  in our fight against Hamas. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=252.26s)]
*  You know, just anecdotally, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=254.8s)]
*  you mentioned Arabs being seen as traitors. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=256.96000000000004s)]
*  We spoke a week and a half ago [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=260.52000000000004s)]
*  with the chief of United, Hatzala, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=262.86s)]
*  who said that he had an Arab volunteer [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=265.66s)]
*  who was captured by Hamas, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=267.8s)]
*  and he was tortured worse than any Israeli was. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=269.6s)]
*  So they're definitely after anybody and everybody [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=272.1s)]
*  who's out there being a part of Israel. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=275.64s)]
*  Mark, it's great to catch up with you. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=278.64s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=280.34000000000003s)]
*  We'll see you again soon. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=281.94s)]
*  I look forward to that, John. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=284.2s)]
*  All right, thank you. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYG7rEeMgPs&t=285.44s)]
