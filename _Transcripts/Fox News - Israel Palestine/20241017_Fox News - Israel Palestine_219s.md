**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs)
*  We can listen out. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=0.0s)]
*  I think we've got it. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=1.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=2.0s)]
*  The greatest butchery sent to Holocaust, the one who murdered thousands of Israelis, has [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=3.0s)]
*  been eliminated. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Today, as we committed ourselves to, he came to account with us. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  Hamas suffered a heavy blow today, but our target goal has not been completed. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=16.64s)]
*  To the dear families of the kidnapped, I tell you, it's an important moment in a war. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=22.84s)]
*  We will continue with all force until bringing all those who are dear to you, who are dear [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=28.44s)]
*  to us, we'll bring them all home. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=33.92s)]
*  This is our utmost commitment, mine and ours. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=36.06s)]
*  And to the residents of Gaza, Sinwar ruined your lives. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  He told you he was a lion, but in reality, he hid in a dark tunnel and he was killed [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  when he ran away in fear from our soldiers. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=55.56s)]
*  I want to repeat again, in the clearest manner, Hamas will no longer rule Gaza. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  This is the beginning of the day of after Hamas. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  It's an opportunity for you, Gaza residents, to finally be freed of his tyranny. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=70.56s)]
*  To the Hamas fighters, those who, I'm telling you all, whoever is holding our kidnap, whoever [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  puts down his arms and allows our kidnap to come out, will live. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=85.92s)]
*  Whoever harms our kidnapped, he's a dead man. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=93.91999999999999s)]
*  This will all bring about a closer time to the victory over Hamas. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=101.52s)]
*  The darkness has been retreating and the light has been rising. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=108.96s)]
*  Nasrallah, Sinwar and others are no longer. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=116.08s)]
*  I tell you, the residents of the area, there's an opportunity to create a new future of peace [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=119.88s)]
*  and prosperity for everyone. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=129.68s)]
*  Together, we can repulse the curse and bring the blessing. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=132.0s)]
*  Now the world knows why we insisted on not ending the war. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=138.88s)]
*  And to get into a fiyach, this was the area where Hamas and many of the other archi-terrorists [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  were hiding. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=152.32s)]
*  I want to thank the IDF, the security forces, and there are no better ones than them. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=154.72s)]
*  Again, we understand what happens to those who hurt us. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=161.52s)]
*  We show the world how the good can win over the bad. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=164.96s)]
*  The war is not over. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=172.24s)]
*  It's a difficult war. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=173.36s)]
*  And heavy price and toll is exacted from us. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=175.72s)]
*  My condolences to the families who have lost their dear ones. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=181.4s)]
*  They're fighting in the last days as well. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=187.84s)]
*  Bring us closer toâ€”as King David said, I will pursue my pursuers until they're all [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=191.64000000000001s)]
*  destroyed. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=202.04000000000002s)]
*  We're in a war of independence. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=203.04000000000002s)]
*  We have to be unified, to be brave, to be strong. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=208.6s)]
*  We fight together, and with the help of the Almighty, we will win. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs&t=214.32s)]
