# Biden's southern border in the spotlight as concerns over terrorist encounters grow
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs)
*  Israel is not the only country with border security issues. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=0.0s)]
*  The insecurity of our own southern border has been well documented. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  What is less well documented is who exactly is crossing that southern border. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=7.36s)]
*  Kansas Senator Roger Marshall wants federal agencies to disclose the number of terrorist [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  encounters at our border. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=17.04s)]
*  That seems like pretty reasonable, I think, doesn't it? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=18.72s)]
*  Senator Marshall joins us now. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=22.44s)]
*  Senator, thank you. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=24.04s)]
*  Who in the world could object to knowing whether terrorists are trying to cross our borders? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=24.92s)]
*  I mean, what is the argument against that? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=31.160000000000004s)]
*  Well, Trey, we have an incompetent secretary of DHS and of course, Joe Biden wants this open border. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=35.64s)]
*  But it's a sad day when our enemies pay more attention to our border than our own president does. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=42.08s)]
*  To your point, we've encountered over 170 terrorists on the terrorist watch list. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=48.2s)]
*  In the past year, in the past two years, thousands of people on the alien watch list as well. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=54.88s)]
*  Two thousand Chinese nationalists on this watch list as well across the border as well. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=62.2s)]
*  All we're asking DHS to do is tell us where these people are, who they are, what they're doing. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=67.36s)]
*  Are they still in the country where they caught release? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=72.6s)]
*  We don't want to be asleep at the will like Israel was when Hamas attacked Israel. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  You know, Senator, I mean, you're a doctor. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=79.84s)]
*  I couldn't make it through math and science, so I went to law school. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=86.44s)]
*  I try to understand the other argument. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=90.4s)]
*  I try to understand those like Ali Mayorkas who say, we're not going to give you the names. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=92.64s)]
*  And I can't think of why. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=98.56s)]
*  I mean, has he ever said, look, Senator, we're not going to tell you about these encounters for the following reasons? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=100.16s)]
*  What is the explanation? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=107.2s)]
*  Well, Trey, there is not an explanation. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  And that's why we asked for a resolution of no confidence back in April for Secretary Mayorkas, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=112.08000000000001s)]
*  hoping that the House would go to some type of process to impeach him. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=117.88000000000001s)]
*  But again, the big theme here is that Joe Biden wants these eight thousand people crossing the border illegally. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=122.04s)]
*  He thinks that those are future votes for the Democrat Party. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=129.04000000000002s)]
*  He wants this crisis. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=131.96s)]
*  And it's hard for me to understand why in the middle of the situation, the crisis in Israel, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=133.44s)]
*  that he would try to leverage that for money in Ukraine, as well as making the border even more porous. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=138.60000000000002s)]
*  He has funding there that will make the asylum process more efficient, so to speak. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=144.12s)]
*  So there's no explanation, Trey. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  We're not going to be able to do it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  Senator, before I let you go, there's a debate going on right now in D.C. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  And across the country, quite candidly, about military aid, Ukraine, Israel. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=159.52s)]
*  Do we combine the packages, separate them out? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=167.04000000000002s)]
*  What do you think is going to happen? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=169.4s)]
*  And how will you be analyzing the two separate aid packages? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=171.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, Trey, we've already asked leadership to separate them. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  And I think the way I would frame the argument is something like this, that in the next seven to ten days, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=181.12s)]
*  Israel could well have a war on all three fronts. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=186.2s)]
*  And that's why we need to get them the aid, the weapons, yesterday. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=189.83999999999997s)]
*  And if any type of bringing these packages together is going to slow down the process, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=194.44s)]
*  it's not be next to impossible. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=198.76s)]
*  We think it's very wrong for the administration, for Joe Biden to leverage the crisis in Israel in order to get his funding for Ukraine. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=200.92s)]
*  I think that your listeners understand the difference between what's happening in Ukraine versus what's happening in Israel, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=209.67999999999998s)]
*  that in Ukraine, this is a seven, nine, ten year war. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=215.48s)]
*  They're at a stalemate. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=219.35999999999999s)]
*  Two hundred thousand people have already died from that situation. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=221.04s)]
*  There's no end in sight. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=224.52s)]
*  And we need to debate what's the future of the United States role in that particular war. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=226.24s)]
*  Meanwhile, the crisis that is occurring in Israel, that this is a war between the people of Israel as well as the Hamas Army of Terror. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=231.2s)]
*  And this isn't just a battle between those two, but this is a battle for the future of humankind that we need to teach terrorists [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=239.28s)]
*  exactly what happens when they cross these savage lines, as you described them, they're lower than animals. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=245.44s)]
*  There's no explanation. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=252.48000000000002s)]
*  So we need to make sure that terrorists understand that we will not tolerate this type of actions. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=253.84s)]
*  Senator Roger Marshall from the great state of Kansas, congratulations, by the way, on beating Oklahoma over the over the weekend. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4h52OM4gs&t=261.92s)]
