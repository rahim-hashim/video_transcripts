# Speaker Mike Johnson holds a press conference with Jewish students
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY)
*  Good morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=0.0s)]
*  How are you doing? [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1.0s)]
*  Good. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2.0s)]
*  How are you? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=3.0s)]
*  And our students. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=4.0s)]
*  If you all want to spread the word, please. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=5.0s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=36.0s)]
*  Thank you for being here today. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=46.68s)]
*  This is a very important day. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  On the House Education and Workforce Committee, we're about to have an incredibly important [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=51.68s)]
*  hearing addressing the rise of antisemitism on our college campuses and universities. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=55.8s)]
*  Joining us today to share their personal stories, we have four incredibly brave students, Talia, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=61.96s)]
*  Bella, Ayel, and Jonathan. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=68.24s)]
*  Jewish students, faculty, and communities at these so-called elite institutions, including [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=71.4s)]
*  my alma mater, Harvard, Jewish students are facing sustained attacks from students and [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=77.52s)]
*  professors who are openly propagandizing terror. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=83.92s)]
*  And why? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=87.88s)]
*  Merely because these Jewish students exist. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  In response, campus leadership has cowered to the woke antisemitic mob. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=92.83999999999999s)]
*  This fanaticism against Israel is rooted in ignorance and hatred. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=99.8s)]
*  Our institutions of higher education are failing our next generation. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=104.28s)]
*  They are failing. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=108.16s)]
*  Talia, Bella, Ayel, Jonathan, and countless other students. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=109.16s)]
*  The attacks on October 7th shocked the conscience of the world, marking the deadliest day for [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=114.52s)]
*  the Jewish people since the Holocaust. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=118.84s)]
*  However, these atrocities were met with callous cruelty at universities across America. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=120.92s)]
*  At Harvard, 30 radical student organizations disgustingly blamed Israel for the barbaric [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=126.92s)]
*  attacks against innocent Israelis, only for the group's actions to be brazenly defended [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=132.6s)]
*  by Harvard president Claudine Gay as, quote, free expression. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=138.36s)]
*  Following our remarks today, the students will join my colleagues at the Education and [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=143.52s)]
*  Workforce Committee hearing, where Harvard, MIT, and Penn's leadership will likely defend [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=147.56s)]
*  desperately their indefensible recent actions and the campus culture that has enabled antisemitism [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=153.28s)]
*  on their campuses. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=159.88s)]
*  Any voice who openly defends the massacre of innocents has chosen the side of terrorism. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=161.60000000000002s)]
*  I continue to demand that Harvard president Claudine Gay resign and that Harvard and schools [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=166.4s)]
*  like it are prohibited from collecting taxpayer dollars. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=170.68s)]
*  In the words of a Holocaust survivor and Jewish advocate who dedicated his life to ensuring [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=174.8s)]
*  the horrors of the Holocaust are not forgotten, famously said, quote, for evil to flourish, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=178.76000000000002s)]
*  it only requires good men to do nothing. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=183.64000000000001s)]
*  House Republicans refuse to do nothing. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=186.72s)]
*  In the last few months, under this speaker's leadership, we have passed bipartisan resolutions [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=189.3s)]
*  in support of our most precious ally Israel, holding college campuses accountable and bringing [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=193.5s)]
*  transparency to the progressive propaganda pushed on American students and paid for by [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=198.68s)]
*  our foreign adversaries. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=204.04s)]
*  We passed an Israeli aid package sitting with Chuck Schumer in the Senate, and this week [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=205.79999999999998s)]
*  House Republicans will bring the Deterrent Act to the House floor, ensuring our foreign [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=210.23999999999998s)]
*  enemies cannot buy the minds of American students and protecting our national security and our [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  college and universities research. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=220.27999999999997s)]
*  We will continue to fight this scourge of antisemitism on college campuses across this [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=222.48s)]
*  country. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=227.56s)]
*  To discuss this further, I want to turn this over to the Chairwoman of the Education and [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=228.5s)]
*  Workforce Committee, who has been a leader on this issue, Chairwoman Virginia Fox. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=232.08s)]
*  Thanks, Elise. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=236.04000000000002s)]
*  Good morning, and thank you all for being here. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=237.04000000000002s)]
*  My Jewish friends, colleagues, and students across America, you've been waiting 59 days [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=244.04000000000002s)]
*  for this moment of justice. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=250.4s)]
*  In just a few short minutes, my committee will call on the presidents of Harvard, MIT, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=252.8s)]
*  and UPenn to testify publicly about the vile demonstrations of antisemitism engulfing their [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=259.24s)]
*  campuses. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm grateful for the Jewish students attending the hearing today. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=267.88s)]
*  They've grown up in a world where stories of antisemitism weren't typical front-page [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=271.8s)]
*  news. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=277.03999999999996s)]
*  All that changed on October 7th. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=278.47999999999996s)]
*  Now antisemitism is spreading like wildfire. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=281.47999999999996s)]
*  Those of Amos and Palestine are painting swastikas on campus halls and throwing rocks at Hillel [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=285.8s)]
*  buildings. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=292.2s)]
*  Universities quick to facilitate the spread of antisemitism are now slow to condemn it. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=294.44s)]
*  The best time for college presidents to have stood up for their Jewish students was October [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=301.52000000000004s)]
*  7th. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=306.6s)]
*  That did not happen. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=308.24s)]
*  The second best time is today. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=310.04s)]
*  I look forward to their testimonies. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=313.52000000000004s)]
*  We're leaving now to go to the hearing because we're going to begin on time. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=316.04s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=320.40000000000003s)]
*  First, before we head out, I want to introduce Talia Khan from MIT to share her story. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=321.40000000000003s)]
*  Talia. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=328.40000000000003s)]
*  Thank you so much, Representative Fox and Representative Stefanik for inviting me here [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=332.44s)]
*  today. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=336.68s)]
*  My name is Talia Khan. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=337.96000000000004s)]
*  I am an undergraduate alumna of MIT and a current graduate student at MIT. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=339.08s)]
*  I am the daughter of a Jewish mother and an Afghan Muslim immigrant father. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=344.23999999999995s)]
*  I am the proud president of the MIT Israel Alliance and I am a Jewish student currently [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=350.03999999999996s)]
*  immersed in an extremely toxic antisemitic atmosphere at MIT. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=355.67999999999995s)]
*  The MIT administration, namely President Sally Kornbluth, has failed to address the crisis [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=361.91999999999996s)]
*  of rampant antisemitism on campus. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=368.44s)]
*  There is a radical anti-Israel group at MIT called the CAA. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=372.28000000000003s)]
*  In recent weeks, the CAA's antisemitic rhetoric has shifted the culture on campus to such [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=376.8s)]
*  an extreme of intolerance that 70% of MIT's Jewish students polled feel forced to hide [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=382.56s)]
*  their identities and perspectives. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=389.72s)]
*  An Israeli student whose identity and personal info was sold online for a bounty has not [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=393.32s)]
*  left his dorm room in weeks out of fear due to death threats. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=399.08s)]
*  For my part, I was forced to leave my study group for my doctoral exams halfway through [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=404.32s)]
*  the semester because my group members told me that the people at the Nova Music Festival [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=409.03999999999996s)]
*  deserved to die because they were partying on stolen land. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=414.67999999999995s)]
*  A post-doc at MIT said that Jewish Israelis want to enslave the world in a global apartheid [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=420.44s)]
*  system. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=426.32s)]
*  He falsely claimed that Israel harvests Palestinian organs and implied that the quote average [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=427.84s)]
*  Israeli is a Nazi. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=433.08s)]
*  The DEI officer of his department replied by telling us that nothing he said was hate [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=435.23999999999995s)]
*  speech and that the organ harvesting conspiracy theory was quote confirmed. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=440.12s)]
*  Day after day, the MIT administration has failed to enforce its own rules on antisemitic [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=446.56s)]
*  actors such as the interfaith chaplain intimidating Jewish students, DEI staff publicly declaring [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=452.76s)]
*  that Israel has no right to exist, faculty dismissing student concerns for their safety [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=460.28s)]
*  by telling them that if they are scared they should just go back to Israel, CAA protesters [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=466.32s)]
*  blocking the hallways, storming the offices of the MIT Israel internship offices and harassing [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=473.68s)]
*  the staff and faculty there and inviting dangerous outsiders to campus to join them in yelling [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=479.36s)]
*  hateful and violent chants. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=484.96000000000004s)]
*  This is the same climate of antisemitism that has led to massacres of Jews throughout the [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=487.72s)]
*  centuries. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=493.16s)]
*  This is not just harassment. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=494.72s)]
*  This is our lives on the line. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=497.04s)]
*  The MIT administration has punted disciplinary processes to a faculty committee on discipline [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=500.3s)]
*  which has thus far not received a single one of our complaints. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=505.5s)]
*  MIT admin has even failed to staff a new task force against hate which will duly combat [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=510.06s)]
*  antisemitism and Islamophobia. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=515.94s)]
*  This atmosphere is intolerable. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=519.38s)]
*  Jewish students do not believe that the MIT administration has done an adequate job to [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=521.98s)]
*  make students feel safe on campus. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=526.14s)]
*  President Kornbluth, please let me go back to being a scientist. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=529.5s)]
*  Let me go back to being a student. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=533.62s)]
*  I don't want to have to keep advocating for Jewish student safety on campus. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=535.6999999999999s)]
*  It's not my job. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=540.66s)]
*  It's your job. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=541.9399999999999s)]
*  Please do your job and act now. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=543.54s)]

*  I am a junior at NYU and I'm going to try to answer the following question for you for [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=571.3399999999999s)]
*  my personal experiences. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=575.62s)]
*  What is it like to be a Jew at NYU? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=577.74s)]
*  Being a Jew at NYU is walking to class and passing torn and defaced posters of innocent [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=580.9s)]
*  hostages with the words occupier and murderer written across their faces. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=585.5s)]
*  It is going to Bopes Library to study and being interrupted by unauthorized protests [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=590.66s)]
*  where students and faculty call for a globalized intifada revolution, an incitement to violence [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=595.5s)]
*  against Jews everywhere, and a call for the annihilation of the Jewish state and my friends [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=601.1s)]
*  and family who live there. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=605.42s)]
*  Being a Jew at NYU is being surrounded by students and faculty who support the murder [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=608.14s)]
*  and kidnapping of Jews because after all, as they say, resistance is justified when [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=613.1s)]
*  people are occupied. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=617.4599999999999s)]

*  for justice end abruptly when the rape victims are Jews. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=624.78s)]
*  Being a Jew at NYU has meant being physically assaulted in NYU's library by a fellow student [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=629.3s)]
*  while I was wearing an American-Israeli flag and having my attacker still roam freely [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=634.4599999999999s)]
*  throughout the campus. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=639.54s)]
*  Being a Jew at NYU is experiencing how diversity, equity, and inclusion is not a value that [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=642.06s)]
*  NYU extends to its Jewish students. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=647.2199999999999s)]
*  Since October 7th, the unmistakable anti-Semitism that I have experienced on campus is reminiscent [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=651.18s)]
*  of the Jew hatred I have heard about from my grandparents, Holocaust survivors, who [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=657.9799999999999s)]
*  experienced first-hand the deafening silence of their neighbors in Poland and Germany when [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=662.9s)]
*  the Nazis first rose to power. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=667.5799999999999s)]
*  As anti-Semitic rhetoric and actions became more and more acceptable, their community [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=670.34s)]
*  shops were looted, their synagogues defaced, and finally, their families were taken away [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=674.5s)]
*  and perished in concentration camps. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=679.58s)]
*  Today, in 2023, at NYU, I hear calls to gasp the Jews and I am told that Hitler was right. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=682.6600000000001s)]
*  To the NYU administration, you are not free to selectively enforce your own rules. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=693.5400000000001s)]
*  You are not free to refuse your Jewish students the same protections that you extend to others. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=699.1s)]
*  NYU has adopted the International Holocaust Remembrance Association's definition of [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=704.94s)]
*  anti-Semitism, which recognizes that calls to harm Jews in the name of radical ideology, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=709.46s)]
*  calls to eradicate Israel, to deny the Jewish people their right to self-determination in [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=716.14s)]

*  I am a proud Jew and I am a proud Zionist. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=728.42s)]
*  I am the granddaughter of Holocaust survivors. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=731.8199999999999s)]
*  We are not going anywhere. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=735.9s)]
*  Anti-Semitism and the support for terror should have no home at NYU or any other college campus. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=739.14s)]
*  We made the promise of never again, and never again is now. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=746.18s)]

*  Because 36 hours ago, I, along with most of campus, sought refuge in our rooms as classmates [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=787.02s)]
*  and professors chanted proudly for the genocide of Jews while igniting smoke bombs and defacing [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=793.62s)]
*  school property. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=798.78s)]

*  brazen display of anti-Semitism. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=805.18s)]
*  He went on saying, silence in the face of last night's demonstration of anti-Semitism [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=808.44s)]
*  and hate near our doorstep is not an option for me. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=814.0s)]
*  Well, the doorstep of the neighboring university is in fact Penn. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=818.12s)]

*  The neighboring university's president swiftly denounced the incident, and yet our president [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=827.84s)]
*  cannot. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=832.6400000000001s)]
*  Because the glorious October 7th, and you're a dirty little Jew, you deserve to die. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=834.68s)]
*  Or words said not by Hamas, but by my classmates and professors. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=840.12s)]

*  On October 7th, Israel was attacked. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=854.52s)]
*  Since October 7th, American Jews have been under attack. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=858.04s)]

*  Penn, once renowned for groundbreaking discoveries like the mRNA vaccine, is now a chilling landscape [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=880.26s)]
*  of hatred and hostility. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=886.1800000000001s)]
*  Our university, revered for its pursuit of knowledge, has devolved into an arena where [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=888.1s)]
*  Jewish students tiptoe through their days, uncertain and unsafe. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=892.74s)]
*  The situation at Penn has escalated into a full-blown crisis, with students openly asserting [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=897.3000000000001s)]
*  their intentions to proceed with plans with or without university permission. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=902.0600000000001s)]
*  During COVID, strict guidelines governed everything from class attendance and graduation talks. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=907.38s)]
*  Yet now, when students and faculty defy policies to intimidate Jewish students, where is the [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=913.78s)]
*  same resolute enforcement? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=918.66s)]
*  For the past three weeks inside Houston Hall, our student center, an anti-Semitic headquarters [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=921.42s)]
*  has been erected, with signs spreading Hamas propaganda. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=926.26s)]
*  The organizers, both Penn-affiliated and not, were initially asked to leave as they are [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=930.18s)]
*  trespassing on campus property. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=934.78s)]
*  Well three weeks later, they are still sleeping there, and countless Jewish students have [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=937.54s)]
*  been harassed. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=941.6999999999999s)]
*  Yet the anti-Semitic dormitory remains. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=942.7s)]
*  Clearly, both a disregard for school policies and permission to disregard them by a university [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=945.3000000000001s)]
*  unwilling to do anything. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=951.1400000000001s)]
*  Not only are tensions palpable, but there have also been materialized actions taken [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=953.46s)]
*  to intimidate and harm students. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=957.44s)]
*  A bomb threat against Hillel, a swastika spray painted, the Hillel and Chabad houses vandalized, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=959.62s)]
*  a professor posting the armed wing of Hamas's logo on Facebook, a Jewish student accosted, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=965.34s)]
*  Jews are Nazis etched adjacent to Penn's Jewish fraternity house. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=972.0600000000001s)]
*  Why doesn't the university hold the perpetrators of such acts accountable? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=977.2600000000001s)]
*  Is the university fearful that they may offend those who wish to intimidate and harass their [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=981.62s)]
*  fellow students? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=986.0200000000001s)]
*  Penn's ambivalence fuels a crisis that has shattered my academic sanctuary. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=987.86s)]
*  Policies meant to safeguard us have become hollow promises. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=993.94s)]
*  And let us be clear, if they fail Jewish students today, tomorrow they will fail the [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=997.28s)]
*  rest of us. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1001.9599999999999s)]
*  Nonetheless, I refused to go back to 1939 when Jews had to hide the religious symbols [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1003.4s)]
*  and hide who they are due to the intimidation and harassment of us. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1008.68s)]
*  I used to think this was nonsense, fear-mongering, until I was made aware that Penn recommended [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1012.72s)]
*  to students, quote, not wear clothing slash accessories related to Judaism. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1018.28s)]
*  Hundreds of posters mocking the hostages featuring cows instead of humans adorned Penn's campus [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1023.8s)]
*  two weeks ago. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1028.24s)]
*  While on my way to class, I was greeted with chalk reading 90% of pigs are gas chambered. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1029.24s)]
*  As a student, despite what my university says, I do not feel safe. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1035.8s)]
*  Let me be clear, I do not feel safe. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1041.3s)]
*  Luckily, there are policies in place to protect students from the heinous acts I described. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1044.44s)]
*  Unluckily, the university seems to have no interest in upholding those very policies. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1050.36s)]
*  It's time for the soul of our university to reclaim its integrity. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1056.28s)]
*  And it's time for me and my fellow classmates to stop worrying for our lives. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1060.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1065.4799999999998s)]

*  The Intifada is an uprising and the last two were marked by blowing up buses and restaurants. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1125.08s)]
*  One day a few weeks ago, I was in a study room in the law school while classes were [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1133.6s)]
*  going on and a mob of 200 people, many of whom not only were not law students, were [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1137.6s)]
*  not Harvard affiliates, got into our building, marched down the halls chanting these phrases. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1143.9599999999998s)]
*  Jews took off their kippot and I watched someone hide under a desk. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1152.08s)]
*  Many of my friends ran up to the Dean of Students and DEI office, but they had locked their [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1158.7199999999998s)]
*  doors for their own safety. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1163.84s)]
*  This was such a clear safety concern. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1166.6s)]
*  It was also explicitly against school policy as it disrupted class. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1169.04s)]
*  We heard nothing from Harvard. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1174.1599999999999s)]
*  No email. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1176.9199999999998s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1177.9199999999998s)]
*  I talk to my Jewish friends on campus every day. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1178.9199999999998s)]
*  They tell me how afraid they are to go to class. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1183.7199999999998s)]
*  They share hate messages they are receiving from other students on social media, including [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1186.56s)]
*  comparing Jews to Nazis. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1191.1399999999999s)]
*  And they ask us, and they ask me, for safety advice because of the lack of effective communication [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1194.2s)]
*  from the university. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1199.8600000000001s)]
*  So you might ask, what's the administration doing? [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1200.8600000000001s)]
*  We've brought them policy violations, proof that they happen, and photos of the student [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1206.6000000000001s)]
*  handbook that were explicitly violated. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1211.0s)]
*  When they respond, if at all, responses are empty and meaningless. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1213.8s)]
*  Responses such as, we are aware of the situation. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1219.54s)]
*  This is not how the university would treat other groups. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1223.02s)]
*  We are happy that Harvard has created an anti-Semitism advisory board, but there is no transparency [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1226.72s)]
*  about what they do. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1232.3799999999999s)]
*  They seemingly don't have executive power. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1234.46s)]
*  They are certainly not accessible to students. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1236.86s)]
*  I've personally asked to meet with them multiple times for weeks, and they have not responded [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1239.68s)]
*  to me. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1244.26s)]
*  And no one knows what happens when you send them an incident report. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1247.4s)]
*  We are not asking to limit free speech. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1252.26s)]
*  We are asking the university to enforce their policies to ensure safety and a climate conducive [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1255.8s)]
*  to education. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1262.64s)]
*  The administration has asked us to abide by the rules, and we have unequivocally. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1264.58s)]
*  It seems more and more that this rule only applies to Jews, as broken rules are not being [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1270.16s)]
*  enforced or outwardly reprimanded. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1277.22s)]
*  I want to be clear. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1280.1399999999999s)]
*  This is not just about the Middle East. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1282.3s)]
*  This is anti-Semitism. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1285.9599999999998s)]
*  Right here. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1288.28s)]
*  In our homes. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1290.1999999999998s)]
*  On our campuses. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1291.84s)]
*  It is dangerous. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1294.1399999999999s)]
*  It is going unchecked. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1295.1399999999999s)]
*  And everyone that does not join to put a stop to it is part of the problem. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1297.8999999999999s)]
*  I am asking as I have been. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1304.82s)]
*  Do something. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1308.2s)]
*  Protect Jewish people. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1311.1200000000001s)]
*  Protect your students. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1315.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1317.8400000000001s)]
*  We want to thank you again, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1322.3200000000002s)]
*  They're so courageous. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1325.96s)]
*  And House Republicans, and I know millions of the American people, empathize with you, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1328.1200000000001s)]
*  sympathize for you, and applaud your courage. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1332.6000000000001s)]
*  We're going to dismiss you because you need to go testify in the House Education Committee [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1334.78s)]
*  because that's a very compelling testimony. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1338.14s)]
*  Thank you again for being here. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1340.1s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1341.9s)]
*  We have some very strong leaders in Congress on these issues, and I want you to hear from [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1348.48s)]
*  one of them right now, the gentleman from California, Mr. Kevin Kylen. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1351.42s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1357.94s)]
*  Just to echo the speaker's sentiments, we just saw our truly profiles in courage. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1358.94s)]
*  It is unfathomable what these young men and women are having to experience and so many [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1364.08s)]
*  of their peers. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1368.24s)]
*  And for them to be here today sharing their story, what they're having to go through with [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1369.6s)]
*  the whole country, takes tremendous courage. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1373.44s)]
*  So I would just ask that you please share their stories. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1375.9199999999998s)]
*  I think it's very important that every American know what is happening on our college campuses. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1378.52s)]
*  This is a time of reckoning for higher education in this country. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1383.8799999999999s)]
*  We have to ask how is it that America's leading, most elite institutions of higher learning [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1388.3799999999999s)]
*  have been gripped by such an ancient and retrograde prejudice as anti-Semitism? [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1394.3799999999999s)]
*  How is it that institutions that have suppressed free speech for years have suddenly discovered [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1400.3s)]
*  the First Amendment as a reason not to condemn terrorism or to stop students from being harassed [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1405.6599999999999s)]
*  or bullied? [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1411.86s)]
*  How is it that university leaders who have waded in to every political issue of the day [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1413.2199999999998s)]
*  were suddenly bound by institutional neutrality when it came to the murder of children? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1418.34s)]
*  How is it that bureaucracies devoted to diversity, equity and inclusion have turned a blind eye [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1424.1599999999999s)]
*  to the targeting of Jewish students on their campuses and in some cases have contributed [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1430.72s)]
*  to that hostile environment? [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1435.3999999999999s)]
*  Yes, this is a time of reckoning for higher education in this country. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1436.84s)]
*  Our universities cost too much, their degrees deliver too little value and they've become [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1441.74s)]
*  among the most intolerant places in the country. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1446.8s)]
*  This is a time to rediscover the purpose of higher education so that our universities [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1450.56s)]
*  are once again leading lights in American life, our national assets, our places of community [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1455.8600000000001s)]
*  and belonging and where the free exchange of ideas flourishes. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1461.8600000000001s)]
*  Nothing less than the future of our country depends on it. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1466.08s)]
*  Thank you very much and as part of the education committee I'm headed to the hearing now as [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1468.92s)]
*  well. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1473.48s)]
*  Thank you, Kevin, so well said. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1475.06s)]
*  We'll now hear from our majority whip, Tom Emmer. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1476.84s)]
*  This week will mark two months since Hamas murdered 1,200 people in cold blood, abducted [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1483.6799999999998s)]
*  over 200 innocent people and brutally raped women, all because of their deep-seated hatred [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1491.1s)]
*  for the Jewish people. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1497.46s)]
*  Good versus evil could not be more clear in this situation, but sadly there are people [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1499.58s)]
*  who have sided with evil and chosen hatred toward their Jewish peers, including on college [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1506.06s)]
*  campuses. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1512.1799999999998s)]
*  Perhaps even more appalling, many so-called leaders on these campuses have turned their [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1514.06s)]
*  backs on Jewish students and allowed anti-Semitism to run rampant. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1518.8999999999999s)]
*  I commend the students who've joined us today to share their experiences. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1523.8999999999999s)]
*  They've shown more courage, frankly, than the administrators who were supposed to protect [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1527.54s)]
*  them and support them. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1531.94s)]
*  And I know we all look forward to hearing what these administrators have to say for [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1534.1399999999999s)]
*  themselves at Chairwoman Fox's hearing today. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1538.5s)]
*  There has been a 388% increase in anti-Semitic incidents of harassment, vandalism and assault [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1542.28s)]
*  in America since October 7. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1549.86s)]
*  Let's make no mistake about it. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1553.1s)]
*  Never again is now. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1556.1s)]
*  There can be no tolerance for anti-Semitism, and tolerance includes silence. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1558.26s)]
*  So today House Republicans will show the world where we stand by passing Congressman David [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1564.4599999999998s)]
*  Kustoff's resolution condemning the concerning rise in anti-Semitism that we've seen here [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1569.1s)]
*  at home and across the globe. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1574.8999999999999s)]
*  There's simply no place for it in our society. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1577.4199999999998s)]
*  And with that, I yield to our leader, Mr. Scalise. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1580.66s)]
*  Over and over again, we hear that saying, evil prevails when good people do nothing. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1587.3400000000001s)]
*  This is one of those times where people need to look in the mirror. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1594.78s)]
*  Anti-Semitism has been spreading throughout our country since the horrendous attacks by [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1599.66s)]
*  Hamas on Israel. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1604.78s)]
*  And make no mistake, this was Hamas attacking Israel. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1607.06s)]
*  It was an unprovoked attack. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1611.1s)]
*  It was a brutal attack, the worst we've seen since the Holocaust. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1613.02s)]
*  And yet since that time, not just in Israel, but here in the United States of America, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1618.06s)]
*  on our college campuses, you've seen a growing anti-Semitism. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1624.22s)]
*  You've seen silence from some of the heads of once great universities who are failing [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1628.94s)]
*  to protect their own students, not just Jewish students, any student that wants to stand [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1634.54s)]
*  up for Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state, for all of us who support Israel. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1640.6599999999999s)]
*  And it used to be overwhelmingly bipartisan in this country, in this Congress. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1646.94s)]
*  You're seeing a divide. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1652.98s)]
*  You're seeing some people not willing to stand up against it. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1655.06s)]
*  Well, that's not going to happen with this House majority. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1658.94s)]
*  This House Republican majority has been very vocal, not only standing with Israel, but [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1662.22s)]
*  standing up against the evil hatred of anti-Semitism. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1666.14s)]
*  We have to be clear with a voice that we will not tolerate it. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1670.3400000000001s)]
*  This is how history repeats itself. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1675.5s)]
*  People wonder, can you ever get back to those days? [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1678.44s)]
*  Could that history, that evil history of the Holocaust ever repeat itself? [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1681.46s)]
*  Well, it only repeats itself if people remain quiet. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1685.9s)]
*  We're not going to remain quiet. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1690.86s)]
*  These students aren't remaining quiet, and they shouldn't. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1692.26s)]
*  They have a right to free expression. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1695.1s)]
*  They have a right to go to school and feel safe for those policies that those university [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1697.4599999999998s)]
*  administrators put in place to be carried out and to speak out. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1703.1799999999998s)]
*  But if others won't speak out, we're going to continue to stand up against this evil [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1708.8999999999999s)]
*  of anti-Semitism. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1714.62s)]
*  And with that, I'm happy to bring up our speaker. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1715.62s)]
*  We want to thank you all again for being here today. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1721.02s)]
*  I think Prime Minister Netanyahu probably said it the best. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1723.1799999999998s)]
*  This truly is a battle between good versus evil, light versus darkness, civilization [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1726.9799999999998s)]
*  versus barbarism. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1732.6399999999999s)]
*  And the idea that this is happening on college campuses, university campuses across this [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1733.6399999999999s)]
*  land is unconscionable to us. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1737.74s)]
*  This anti-Semitism has become all too common. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1741.1s)]
*  It's turning to violence in some of these places. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1743.86s)]
*  And the idea that university administrators who would not speak out, would not take care [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1746.32s)]
*  of this problem is just beyond comprehension. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1749.98s)]
*  You heard the harrowing tales of these students. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1753.6200000000001s)]
*  We could parade many of them up here today to share their experiences from across the [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1755.26s)]
*  land, and it must stop. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1759.18s)]
*  No Jewish student should feel unsafe going to class or congregating in public or professing [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1761.08s)]
*  their faith. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1766.1s)]
*  Remember, this is not who we are as Americans. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1767.1s)]
*  The first freedom that we are guaranteed in the Bill of Rights and our Constitution is [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1769.68s)]
*  the freedom of religion, the free exercise of religion. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1773.78s)]
*  It's an essential component to who we are as Americans. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1777.22s)]
*  And that's everyone's religion, even minority faiths. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1779.9s)]
*  For Jewish students to be targeted like this, for them to be suppressed in the expression [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1783.5400000000002s)]
*  of their faith or identity is just not who we are as a country. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1787.8200000000002s)]
*  We have to change this. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1793.3400000000001s)]
*  And make no mistake, what's happening at colleges today is not free speech. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1795.3400000000001s)]
*  It's exactly the opposite. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1799.42s)]
*  The stifling of free speech and free expression, the demonizations of students for simply living [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1801.42s)]
*  out their faith and who they are. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1806.0400000000002s)]
*  As members of this body, we have to call out those in Congress as well who employ Hamas's [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1808.4s)]
*  talking points like from the river to the sea, which we all know is an explicit call [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1813.2s)]
*  for the extermination of Israel. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1817.0400000000002s)]
*  History has proven that anti-Semitism, if less unchecked, will not stop for the Jewish [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1819.2800000000002s)]
*  people. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1824.2s)]
*  It goes to other minorities and ultimately to persons of all religions. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1825.2s)]
*  We have to stand up to this hatred. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1828.8600000000001s)]
*  And I'm so proud to stand alongside leaders like this team behind me and all the House [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1831.48s)]
*  Republicans who have made this unequivocal where we stand, that we are for the good in [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1835.3999999999999s)]
*  this battle. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1840.1599999999999s)]
*  We are for religious students, Jewish students across the country, and we want them to be [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1841.1599999999999s)]
*  protected and respected. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1846.12s)]
*  With that, we'll take a few questions if you have any. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1847.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1849.9199999999998s)]
*  What shifted over the past few weeks from the trying to maybe bring up an impeachment [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1850.9199999999998s)]
*  vote and a new query vote next week? [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1856.9199999999998s)]
*  What happened politically and what's the risk to some of the members from swing districts [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1858.9199999999998s)]
*  fighting this race? [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1863.92s)]
*  Do you think it's still a long list of a big, consistent? [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1864.92s)]
*  Well, look, the impeachment inquiry is necessary because, as you know, our committees of jurisdiction, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1867.92s)]
*  oversight, judiciary, ways and means, Chairman Comer and Jordan and Smith have done an extraordinary [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1873.28s)]
*  job following the facts on this. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1878.4s)]
*  Remember, remember, Article 1 of the Constitution gives the House the impeachment authority. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1880.96s)]
*  And I've said at this podium before, next to a declaration of war, impeachment, arguably [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1885.4s)]
*  the heaviest power that the House has. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1889.8000000000002s)]
*  Why? [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1892.16s)]
*  Because it's so serious. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1893.4s)]
*  It's so important. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1894.4s)]
*  In the previous couple of years, the House Democrats cheapened impeachment. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1895.4s)]
*  They used it for partisan political purposes. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1900.3200000000002s)]
*  They went after Donald Trump twice. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1902.52s)]
*  I served on the impeachment defense team twice. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1903.8000000000002s)]
*  We called those sham impeachments, snap impeachments. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1906.28s)]
*  They were. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1908.6000000000001s)]
*  What you're seeing right now is exactly the opposite of that. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1909.6000000000001s)]
*  You're seeing a very deliberate investigation following, uncovering and following the facts, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1911.88s)]
*  following the truth where it leads. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1917.48s)]
*  That's what the Constitution requires the House to do. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1918.68s)]
*  And the House Republicans have done that very methodically. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1921.6s)]
*  So we have come to this sort of inflection point because, Chad, right now the White House [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1923.56s)]
*  is putting, is stonewalling that investigation. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1927.48s)]
*  They're refusing to turn over key witnesses to allow them to testify as they've been subpoenaed. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1931.36s)]
*  They're refusing to turn over thousands of documents for the National Archives. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1935.6799999999998s)]
*  And the House has no choice if it's going to follow its constitutional responsibility [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1939.36s)]
*  to formally adopt an impeachment inquiry on the floor so that when the subpoenas are challenged [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1943.56s)]
*  in court, we'll be at the apex of our constitutional authority. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1948.3999999999999s)]
*  It will be a movement of a vote of the full House. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1951.16s)]
*  And that will allow us to continue and continue on pace. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1954.44s)]
*  This vote is not a vote to impeach President Biden. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1957.44s)]
*  This is a vote to continue the inquiry of impeachment. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1961.12s)]
*  And that's a necessary constitutional step. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1964.96s)]
*  And I believe we'll get every vote that we can. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1966.5s)]
*  It's hard though, among some of these moderates, you know, that they're getting bragged into [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1967.5s)]
*  this. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1968.5s)]
*  You know, this is going to be a tough vote. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1969.5s)]
*  Can you see that? [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1970.5s)]
*  No, all the moderates in our conference understand this is not a political decision. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1971.5s)]
*  This is a legal decision. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1978.16s)]
*  This is a constitutional decision. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1979.52s)]
*  And whether someone is for or against impeachment is of no import right now. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1981.32s)]
*  We have to continue our legal responsibility. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1985.1399999999999s)]
*  And that is only, solely what this vote is about. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1988.24s)]
*  We'd have to be here for a long time for me to unpack that. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=1991.24s)]
*  Look, I think the January 6 committee was a partisan exercise. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2009.24s)]
*  They claim that it was bipartisan, but I think we all recognize that the two Republican members [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2013.56s)]
*  that served on that committee had another agenda. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2018.96s)]
*  I think that what we got was a biased report. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2022.0s)]
*  I think they hid some of the important evidence. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2024.68s)]
*  And look, we want the American people to draw their own conclusions. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2027.88s)]
*  I don't think partisan elected officials in Washington should present a narrative and [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2030.88s)]
*  expect that it should be seen as the ultimate truth on it when we know that they hid certain [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2035.7s)]
*  elements. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2042.0s)]
*  The release of the January 6 tapes is a critical and important exercise. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2043.0s)]
*  We want transparency. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2047.42s)]
*  We should demand that the American people do. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2048.92s)]
*  We trust, House Republicans trust the American people to draw their own conclusions. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2051.2400000000002s)]
*  We should not, they should not be dictated by some narrative and accept that as fact. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2055.32s)]
*  So they can review the tapes themselves. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2058.7200000000003s)]
*  We're going through a methodical process of releasing them as quickly as we can. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2060.98s)]
*  As you know, we have to blur some of the faces of persons who participated in the events [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2064.64s)]
*  of that day because we don't want them to be retaliated against and to be charged by [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2070.6800000000003s)]
*  the DOJ and to have other concerns and problems. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2076.56s)]
*  So that's a slow process to get it done. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2079.36s)]
*  We're working steadily on it. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2081.72s)]
*  We've hired additional personnel to do that. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2083.4s)]
*  And all of those tapes ultimately at the end will be out so everybody can see them and [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2085.6s)]
*  draw their own conclusion. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2089.42s)]
*  Let me go to the back row. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2090.42s)]
*  Back row. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2091.42s)]

*  Back row. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2093.42s)]
*  So H Ukraine has been on Southern Northern Security. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2094.42s)]
*  What's the bare minimum there if you would be acceptable in order to make that range? [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2095.42s)]
*  Look, we're in negotiations on that right now. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2104.58s)]
*  I'll just tell you that any national security package has to begin with the security of [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2106.98s)]
*  our own border. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2112.34s)]
*  That's what the American people deserve. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2113.34s)]
*  I've been all across this country in the last couple of weeks and no matter where I am, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2114.34s)]
*  everyone, everyone of any party or no party is deeply concerned about the open southern [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2119.38s)]

*  Whether you're in New York City or you're in South Texas, people see what it's doing [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2125.14s)]
*  to our country. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2128.7400000000002s)]
*  It is unconscionable to me that the White House would continue its current policies [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2129.7400000000002s)]
*  and not enforce our federal law. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2133.8999999999996s)]
*  We passed H.R.2 as a top priority to the House Republicans six months ago. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2135.7s)]
*  It's been sitting over there in the Senate collecting dust. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2139.9799999999996s)]
*  We have to affect real policy change at the border and that is a necessary condition to [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2142.4199999999996s)]
*  anything we do going forward. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2147.14s)]
*  Look, we're going to get a briefing on Ukraine today from Jake Sullivan, National Security [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2148.8999999999996s)]
*  Advisor, and I told Mr. Sullivan very directly that there are important questions that must [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2153.22s)]
*  be answered so that we can continue with these negotiations. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2160.4599999999996s)]
*  Among those is what is the objective? [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2164.5s)]
*  What is the end game in Ukraine? [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2165.9199999999996s)]
*  How are we going to have proper oversight over the funds, the precious treasure of American [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2167.24s)]
*  taxpayers? [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2170.98s)]
*  Because when we go home to our town halls, they ask us a very important question. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2172.14s)]
*  How can we be engaged in securing the border of foreign countries if we can't secure our [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2176.06s)]
*  own? [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2180.22s)]
*  And that is a question the White House has to help us answer. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2181.22s)]
*  I've told this to the leaders in the Senate. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2183.5s)]
*  I've told it to the White House and I'll say it until we're blue in the face. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2185.5s)]
*  We are committed to that. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2188.48s)]
*  The battle is for the border. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2189.54s)]
*  We do that first as a top priority and we'll take care of these other obligations. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2191.64s)]
*  Last question. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21DsaSD1LY&t=2196.02s)]
