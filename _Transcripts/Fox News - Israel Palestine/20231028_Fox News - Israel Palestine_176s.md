# How do Israel’s ground operations affect hostage negotiations?
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXbUC4EqmnU)
*  Anyway, joining us now live on the ground is in Jerusalem, is Trace Gallagher. Trace. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXbUC4EqmnU&t=0.0s)]
*  And Sean, this is a very scary night for Israel because as you note, the 300,000 plus IDF soldiers [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXbUC4EqmnU&t=6.48s)]
*  on the border of Gaza ready to go in. Some have already gone in. Just think about that. But three [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXbUC4EqmnU&t=12.72s)]
*  weeks ago, these people were mostly bankers and accountants and plumbers, and now they are [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXbUC4EqmnU&t=17.68s)]
*  fighters prepping to go to war. And it's unclear exactly how much training or retraining they've [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXbUC4EqmnU&t=22.96s)]
*  got. The expanded ground operation, Sean, was really meant to be at this stage prepping the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXbUC4EqmnU&t=27.52s)]
*  battlefield, meaning you send in your heavy tanks, you send in your big equipment to go in there and [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXbUC4EqmnU&t=34.0s)]
*  kind of lay a path for more soldiers to get in. And in doing that, you had IDF, Air Force teams [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXbUC4EqmnU&t=39.84s)]
*  going in all week bombarding northern Gaza so they too could kind of lay that territory flat, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXbUC4EqmnU&t=46.64s)]
*  make it easier to get a pathway in. We expected this to be exactly that, prepping the battlefield, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXbUC4EqmnU&t=53.04s)]
*  and yet the Times of Israel is now reporting tonight that there have been significant clashes [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXbUC4EqmnU&t=59.92s)]
*  between Hamas and Israeli defense forces. We do not know the extent of those clashes or if there [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXbUC4EqmnU&t=65.92s)]
*  are any casualties, and we don't even know if they are still going on at this hour, daylight, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXbUC4EqmnU&t=72.88s)]
*  about an hour, maybe two hours away here, Sean. We expect these incursions each night to get [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXbUC4EqmnU&t=77.76s)]
*  bigger as the ground war kind of moves in, bigger and bigger, and then move their way from northern [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXbUC4EqmnU&t=84.08000000000001s)]
*  Gaza into southern Gaza or into central Gaza. The question becomes, what is the impact of the ground [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXbUC4EqmnU&t=90.88000000000001s)]
*  war like Steve Harrigan was talking about? Do these, the incursions force Hezbollah in the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXbUC4EqmnU&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  north, in Lebanon, to fire into northern Israel? And how does it affect the negotiations with the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXbUC4EqmnU&t=105.6s)]
*  hostages? We talked to a lot of families who were hoping that they would hold off on this ground war [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXbUC4EqmnU&t=110.96s)]
*  for maybe a few more days or a few more weeks to give diplomacy a time to get their loved ones out. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXbUC4EqmnU&t=116.72s)]
*  There was a lot of talk today about Qatar that was negotiating some hostage deal to get a significant [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXbUC4EqmnU&t=122.32s)]
*  number of hostages out, but as soon as this expanded ground operation became noteworthy, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXbUC4EqmnU&t=129.20000000000002s)]
*  that all stopped. And so here we are tonight. A lot of people concern, Sean, that this might slow [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXbUC4EqmnU&t=136.08s)]
*  down the hostage negotiation. And yet you have a top aide to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXbUC4EqmnU&t=142.72s)]
*  they believe the best way to get these hostages out is to go in and smash Hamas and take these [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXbUC4EqmnU&t=149.84s)]
*  people out themselves. Sean. All right, Trey Scaligar. We'll have more on that throughout the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXbUC4EqmnU&t=155.92s)]
*  evening. Stand by. Trey's also will be on right after us tonight. Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXbUC4EqmnU&t=160.39999999999998s)]
