# Kamala Harris is where federal initiatives go to die: Paul Mauro
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0)
*  The Biden administration is facing new backlash for rolling out a national strategy to counter [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=0.0s)]
*  Islamophobia at a time when we are seeing rising levels of anti-Semitism across the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=6.84s)]
*  country that has skyrocketed above 400 percent. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=12.6s)]
*  Vice President Harris made the announcement on social media and had this to say. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=17.72s)]
*  For years, Muslims in America and those perceived to be Muslim have endured a disproportionate [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=22.8s)]
*  number of hate-fueled attacks. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=28.8s)]
*  I am proud to announce the Biden-Harris administration will develop our nation's first national strategy [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=31.12s)]
*  to counter Islamophobia. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=38.4s)]
*  This strategy will be a comprehensive and detailed plan to protect Muslims and those [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=40.96s)]
*  perceived to be Muslim from hate, bigotry and violence, and to address the concern that [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=45.88s)]
*  some government policies may discriminate against Muslims. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  But just this week, Jewish students at Cornell University faced terrifying online threats [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=56.76s)]
*  of violence. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=62.199999999999996s)]
*  The student behind those threats appeared in court yesterday and is charged with threatening [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  to shoot up, stab, murder and rape Jews on campus. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=67.08s)]
*  The school is now cancelling classes tomorrow, citing extraordinary stress on campus and [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=72.6s)]
*  allowing a community day for students to take self-care. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=77.42s)]
*  Kayleigh, I don't think these kids need a community day. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=81.12s)]
*  I think there needs to be a hard line drawn by every campus and every person that anti-Semitism [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=84.64s)]
*  will not be tolerated and the filth coming out of the pro-Hamas demonstrations and the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=90.32s)]
*  vile rhetoric coming out of these students' mouths will be not tolerated. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=95.28s)]
*  And it starts at the top. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=99.82s)]
*  You're exactly right. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=100.92s)]
*  There is no moral clarity here on the part of these college administrators who don't [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=102.44s)]
*  fire, you know, a professor who celebrated October 7th when babies were lit on fire and [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  he celebrated, he's on administrative leave and not fired. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=112.08000000000001s)]
*  So it starts at the top, but it starts at the top top at the White House when Corrine [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=114.84s)]
*  Jean-Pierre asked about anti-Semitism. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=118.44000000000001s)]
*  All of a sudden talks about Islamophobia, cleans it up the next day, should have been [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=120.84s)]
*  a gut answer. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=124.0s)]
*  It starts with Kamala Harris, you know, this effort to combat Islamophobia. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=125.10000000000001s)]
*  What we are seeing, look at FBI data from 2023, a 37% increase in anti-Semitism. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=128.8s)]
*  It was the highest of any religious group with Jewish people being targeted six times [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=135.18s)]
*  more than their Muslim counterparts. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=140.28s)]
*  So that was before the attack. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=143.12s)]
*  This attack happened and you have anti-Semitism up 388%. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  We should call out Al-Hait, yes, but the hate that is predominantly happening right now [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=148.04s)]
*  is anti-Semitism and it must be addressed and not equivocated as we're seeing at the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=152.44s)]
*  White House. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=156.48s)]
*  And Paul, so whenever we've heard like strong rhetoric coming out of our president's mouths, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=157.48s)]
*  it's usually for anything but this. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=162.56s)]
*  We know that there was a zero tolerance for firearms dealers who go rogue. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=164.66s)]
*  He said anyone who acts disrespectfully will be fired on the spot from his administration. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=169.44s)]
*  The list goes on, yet where is that strength, where is that condemnation about anti-Semitism [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=174.74s)]
*  now without equivocating it and bringing in anything else but this particular situation? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=179.6s)]
*  So let's remember something. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=185.42s)]
*  Kamala Harris is also supposed to be our border czar. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=187.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=189.8s)]
*  So that's a clue here, all right? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=190.8s)]
*  Kamala is where federal initiatives go to die. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=192.68s)]
*  Nothing's going to get done here. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=195.92s)]
*  There's going to be some rhetoric, et cetera. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=196.92s)]
*  And we're in trouble in Michigan. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=198.8s)]
*  And so we better do something because we're losing votes there up in the Hamtramck, Detroit [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=201.32000000000002s)]
*  areas, et cetera. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=206.0s)]
*  So realistically, it's just a political move to make sure that they assuage some of the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=207.0s)]
*  issues they're having in the electoral process here for the general, not in the primary. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=211.16000000000003s)]
*  And what it does ignore is exactly what Kayleigh articulates, which aside from the fact that [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=216.88000000000002s)]
*  all the rhetoric that you're hearing in the colleges is far more anti-Semitism than Islamophobia. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  You're sitting where I used to sit. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=226.44s)]
*  The violence resides there as well, including this latest arrest. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=228.20000000000002s)]
*  Now, federal government and the intel services in America are going to have to reposition [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=232.60000000000002s)]
*  themselves against that stuff. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=237.3s)]
*  And I can tell you now they were not. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=239.46s)]
*  In the same way, they're going to have to reposition themselves against Hamas, which [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=241.44s)]
*  was never considered a domestic threat. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=245.04000000000002s)]
*  So these are newly emerging things. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=247.60000000000002s)]
*  All you have to do is watch the videos of what's going on in our campuses to realize [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=249.24s)]
*  There is an enormous new potential suspect pool regarding violence, domestic violence, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=253.68s)]
*  ideologically driven violence. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=260.08s)]
*  The agencies are usually very reticent to dip into colleges. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=262.44s)]
*  That's a bit of a red line. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=266.64s)]
*  I know we're a nation of vanishing red lines, but that's one that's got to go because there's [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=267.92s)]
*  a lot of trouble on these campuses. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=271.8s)]
*  We've all seen it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=273.32s)]
*  We've got to get over that. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=274.32s)]
*  Looks like we need 21 Jump Street. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=275.32s)]
*  But to be honest- [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=277.2s)]
*  I mean, you know I'm a sucker for Johnny Depp and Richard Grieco. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=278.2s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=280.72s)]
*  I appreciate the reference. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=281.72s)]
*  Yesterday in town here, Kennedy, when I was walking home, I saw a huge short box truck [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=283.36s)]
*  that was like a billboard, LED lighting up flashing, like the Times Square kind. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=288.72s)]
*  And on it was absolutely vile anti-Semitic comments and imagery and concepts and the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=293.04s)]
*  like that I had to watch drive through unfettered throughout the streets of New York. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=299.04s)]
*  And you contrast that with the New York Times, for example, calling people that are pulling [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=303.52000000000004s)]
*  down the kidnapped by Hamas posters as a form of protest. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=308.68s)]
*  And now the White House comes out with the Islamophobia plan. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=314.28000000000003s)]
*  No wonder all of this, what we're seeing, it's growing, it's acceptable somehow. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=317.8s)]
*  It's a social contagion. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=322.0s)]
*  Yet nowhere is that black line being drawn since it's so clear to the rest of us. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=323.36s)]
*  It should be clear. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=328.16s)]
*  To rational people, it is clear. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=329.16s)]
*  You have malignant irrationalism at play here. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=331.64s)]
*  And so I look at this. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=335.84000000000003s)]
*  I look at the social media posts from, you know, our glorified vice president, and I'm [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=337.12s)]
*  thinking, who is running policy? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=341.68s)]
*  Is it Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=344.08s)]
*  You know, these people who should be censored for some of the comments that they have made [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=347.2s)]
*  because this is not anti-Israel. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=352.88s)]
*  This is anti-Semitism writ large. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=355.6s)]
*  And now it is codified. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=358.48s)]
*  And there are people who feel they have permission to not talk about, you know, the BDS movement, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=360.32s)]
*  which is really soft peddling it. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=365.16s)]
*  To put the eradication of Israel off the map. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=366.7s)]
*  That's what they want. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=370.7s)]
*  They're not holding back. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=371.7s)]
*  It is so incredibly dangerous. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=372.7s)]
*  So I'm glad that those trustees and I'm glad that those donors to these big schools who [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=375.09999999999997s)]
*  have sat by for decades are finally sitting up going, where are my millions going to? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=379.38s)]
*  This is it. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=384.4s)]
*  This is what academia has become. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=385.4s)]
*  And unfortunately, yes, it is. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=387.34s)]
*  And it's terrifying. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=390.18s)]
*  Think about those kids who want to go dine in the kosher dining halls. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=391.3s)]
*  And they can't because they are scared that they are going to come under attack by people [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=394.9s)]
*  who have been radicalized. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=400.14s)]
*  But they're trying to normalize that radicalization. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=402.02s)]
*  And that is what is so incredibly dangerous in these college campuses, which will only [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=405.29999999999995s)]
*  bleed into culture as a whole when these people enter into adulthood eventually. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=409.82s)]
*  Well, we just saw an example of that on Cornell because the you know, Patrick Dye, the suspect [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=415.82s)]
*  in those threats that were made online, you know, he made that very threat against the [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=421.18s)]
*  kosher dining hall. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=426.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=427.1s)]
*  That was exactly right. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=428.1s)]
*  I want to point out something that I don't think is getting any coverage. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=429.1s)]
*  And we focus a lot on campuses that are anti-Israel. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=431.94s)]
*  There are a lot of them that are pro-Israel. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=434.70000000000005s)]
*  And my team and I put together a list and the scroll on my phone is like 19 pages. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=437.06s)]
*  And I just want to say Arizona State University is an enormous college campus. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=443.18s)]
*  So when the when the president of ASU says we are pro-Israel, Michael M. Crow, put his [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=448.34s)]
*  name at the top. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=454.58s)]
*  Florida State University. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=455.58s)]
*  Florida State University, Connecticut State Colleges and universities, all of them. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=456.58s)]
*  Dillard University and Bushnell, which is located in Oregon, Florida International University, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=462.82s)]
*  HBCUs that are also on this list. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=468.9s)]
*  I mean, it goes on and on and on. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=471.65999999999997s)]
*  And it's pretty amazing that that doesn't get covered. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=474.42s)]
*  And I think it's important to say that there are people out there who are going to start [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=478.42s)]
*  to look at some of these other schools and universities that are not among the most, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=482.44s)]
*  you know, expensive in the world. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=487.22s)]
*  Kennedy, those elite bastions, as you might call them, of real democracies. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=488.98s)]
*  They like to look and talk and whatever. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=493.98s)]
*  They're going to look at places where they really want their kids to grow up further, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=496.46000000000004s)]
*  where their values are further. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=499.66s)]
*  ASU's great school. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=501.3s)]
*  I was just going to say that the opposition that Kennedy is talking about is well funded [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=505.18s)]
*  and well organized. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=510.1s)]
*  Where's the money coming from? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=512.1s)]
*  And I would posit that if you drill down far enough, we're going to see some foreign actors [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=513.98s)]
*  who don't have our interests at heart. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=519.98s)]
*  And let's leave it there. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltgs9G2SFQ0&t=521.78s)]
