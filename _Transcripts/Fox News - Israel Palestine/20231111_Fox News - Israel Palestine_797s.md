# Mark Levin: The New York Times has blood on its hands
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4)
*  Hello America, I'm Mark Levin and this is Life, Liberty and Levin. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=0.0s)]
*  What do we do in a constitutional republic [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=4.0s)]
*  when we have a media that dresses up as the free press, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=7.84s)]
*  but really isn't what was intended by our framers of the constitution? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=12.8s)]
*  Oh, the press is free, but the press is free to lie, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=17.12s)]
*  to censor, to cover up, to omit, to project, to create narratives, and that's [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=21.04s)]
*  what the American press has done, that's what they've done to Donald Trump, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=26.8s)]
*  that's what they've done to conservatives, that's what they do about [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=30.48s)]
*  everything. It is a radical element within our society, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=33.76s)]
*  it is part of the Democrat party, and it's part of the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=38.16s)]
*  American Marxist and now Islamist mentality, and I don't need to do a [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=41.28s)]
*  whole lot to prove it. Just spend a few hours doing research, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=47.92s)]
*  in fact I wrote an entire book on it, on freedom of the press, but I want to get [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=52.08s)]
*  into some specifics with you, because at times like this, when there's [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=55.92s)]
*  an obvious right versus wrong, good versus evil, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=61.440000000000005s)]
*  people trying to exterminate other people, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=65.04s)]
*  at a time like this you can really see who the culprits are, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=68.72s)]
*  who the reprobates are. But a little bit of context first, let's start with the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=73.84s)]
*  New York Times. I wrote a book, chapter six, on the New [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=78.56s)]
*  York Times during the Holocaust. Deborah Lipstead, who actually works for [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=82.0s)]
*  Biden right now, why she hasn't resigned yet, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=85.68s)]
*  that's on her conscience, called Beyond Belief, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=88.16000000000001s)]
*  an outstanding book on how the New York Times covered up the Holocaust. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=91.44000000000001s)]
*  Buried by the Times, fantastic professor, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=95.44000000000001s)]
*  Laura Leff, the Holocaust and America's most important newspaper. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=98.64000000000001s)]
*  Dr. David S. Wyman, a sinister, deceased, fantastic individual, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=103.12s)]
*  he wrote the first, The Abandonment of the Jews, America and the Holocaust, 1941-1945. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=107.76s)]
*  You can see these are serious books, serious people. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=113.12s)]
*  And it wasn't even just the Holocaust. Another great book, Stalin's Apologist, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=117.68s)]
*  Walter Durandee, by S.J. Taylor. This is the New York Times. This is the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=122.4s)]
*  New York Times. The New York Times has blood on its hands. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  In fact, it was so bad that on its 150th anniversary, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=132.4s)]
*  the former managing editor of the New York Times felt, well maybe I ought to [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=136.88s)]
*  write something about it. Max Frankel, November 14, 2001, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=140.4s)]
*  22 years ago, and his first paragraph is, and then there was failure, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=146.08s)]
*  none greater than the staggering, staining failure of the New York Times [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=150.96s)]
*  to depict Hitler's methodical extermination of the Jews of Europe [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=156.08s)]
*  as a horror beyond all other horrors in World War II, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=160.08s)]
*  a Nazi war within the war crying out for illumination. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  So the question has is, has the New York Times learned anything? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=171.20000000000002s)]
*  This from Tablet by Professor Leff. The New York Times is Nazi correspondent. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=175.12s)]
*  At the outbreak of the Second World War, the New York Times bureau chief from [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=181.68s)]
*  Berlin, Guido Enderis, was known to sit in the bar of the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=185.28s)]
*  city's famous Alden Hotel, spouting, quote, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=188.8s)]
*  a loud-mouthed defense of Nazism, unquote, eventually provoking another [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  reporter to complain to the Times publisher, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=196.4s)]
*  quote, isn't it about time that the New York Times did something about its Nazi [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=198.96s)]
*  correspondent, unquote? But the Times had no intention of [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=202.72s)]
*  doing anything about Enderis. In fact, it valued its close [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=207.12s)]
*  connections to the Nazi government, as it had throughout the 1930s. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=210.32s)]
*  All American newspapers found reporting in Nazi Germany difficult. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=214.8s)]
*  The government tightly controlled information and harangued and threatened [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=218.56s)]
*  reporters who managed to publish what it didn't like. The Nazi [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=222.24s)]
*  regime also didn't hesitate to use its strongest weapons, banning a newspaper [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=226.24s)]
*  from distribution in Germany, kicking a reporter out of the country, denying a [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  reporter's re-entry. As a putatively Jewish-owned newspaper, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=234.48000000000002s)]
*  the New York Times considered itself a special target. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=238.8s)]
*  Bureau chief Enderis' job, therefore, was, quote, administering reasonably soothing [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=242.08s)]
*  syrup, unquote, to Nazi officials, as another Times reporter puts it. When [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=246.8s)]
*  it comes to the fundamentals of life versus death, the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=252.0s)]
*  extermination of human beings by regime, the New York Times sided [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=255.76s)]
*  with, quote, unquote, the regime, in a manner in which it reported or [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=264.24s)]
*  didn't report information. And it's doing exactly the same thing [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=269.2s)]
*  today, despite its phony apology in 2001. Here's the New York Post. New York [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=274.56s)]
*  Times hires Hitler-praising Salman Hiji to cover the Hamas war. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=280.32s)]
*  The New York Times reporter came under fire last year for praising Adolf [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=286.64s)]
*  Hitler, and multiple resurfaced Facebook posts was rehired by the [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=290.56s)]
*  gray lady to cover the Israel-Palestine war. When it was uncovered, they dropped [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=295.04s)]
*  the guy. But then enough time passed, so they bring him back. And now, with [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=300.24s)]
*  October 7th, they want him to help present information to you about what's [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=305.44s)]
*  going on in the war. Palestinian filmmaker Salman Hiji hailed the Nazi [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=312.56s)]
*  leaders recently as 2018 in a post on Facebook when he shared a photo of [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=317.04s)]
*  himself captioned that he was, quote, in a state of harmony as Hitler was [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=321.68s)]
*  during the Holocaust, unquote. That same year, Hiji was hired by the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=325.68s)]
*  Times as a freelance journalist and worked on a slew of visual [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=330.4s)]
*  investigations published by the organization through 2021, including [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=333.28s)]
*  one on an Israeli airstrike that killed 44 people. His 2018 post, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=337.6s)]
*  including a 2012 Facebook post where he wrote, quote, how great you are [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=342.88s)]
*  Hitler in Arabic alongside a photoshopped image of Hitler, seemingly [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=347.12s)]
*  taking a selfie. At the time, Hiji didn't appear to be working for the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=351.84000000000003s)]
*  Times anymore, and it's since taken down as controversial pro-Hitler [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=356.56s)]
*  post. So why did they rehire him? Out of all the people? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=360.40000000000003s)]
*  New York Times, a few years back, remember this anti-Semitic cartoon? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=366.88s)]
*  Well, they apologized for it, but it was followed soon thereafter by this [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=372.24s)]
*  anti-Semitic cartoon with the Prime Minister of Israel with a selfie taking [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=376.40000000000003s)]
*  a picture of himself. You see his eyes with a starved David on a tablet. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=381.44s)]
*  The New York Times is loaded with Israel hating anti-Semites, just as it's loaded [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=387.52s)]
*  with American hating reporters, opinion writers and so forth. You have to ask [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=392.79999999999995s)]
*  yourself, if you're a reporter for the New York Times, you have any connection [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=398.0s)]
*  to the New York Times, aren't you ashamed of yourself with the blood that [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=401.2s)]
*  this newspaper has on its hands? And I can't do it right now, but also 1932, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=405.44s)]
*  Walter Durante was their correspondent in Moscow. He was Stalin's mouthpiece [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=411.36s)]
*  for 12 years. They knew it. And in 1932, Stalin slaughtered millions of [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=418.56s)]
*  Ukrainians, something about the Russians slaughtered on Ukrainians, you know, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=423.28000000000003s)]
*  but they did it then too. And the New York Times kept them. And not only that, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=427.04s)]
*  he got a Pulitzer Prize. But the New York Times isn't alone. Here we have CNN, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=432.56s)]
*  the Jewish Noon Syndicate, CNN's anti-Semitic disgrace. A CNN analysis [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=438.96s)]
*  explains anti-Semitism by engaging in it. CNN International Platform's anti-Semite [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=444.96s)]
*  to accuse Jews of racism. Christiane Amandpour and the institutionalization [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=452.08s)]
*  of media bias. CNN reporting Palestinian grief, but omitting Palestinian [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=457.84s)]
*  celebration of murder after October 7th. CNN's Mea Copa and Ali Hospital, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=464.0s)]
*  remember the fake headline from the New York Times? They weren't alone. CNN too. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=470.64s)]
*  But they slowly walked back, then they apologized, but they really didn't [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=474.88s)]
*  apologize. They're not alone. MSNBC, among the worst of them. They have a host [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=479.28s)]
*  here by the name of Mehdi Hassan. A few years back, he was at an event and he [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=486.4s)]
*  spoke his true feelings and it was videotaped. And he said, and of course, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=492.08s)]
*  the kaffir, the disbelievers, the atheists who remain deaf and stubborn to the [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=496.64s)]
*  teachings of Islam, the rational message of Quran. They're described in the Quran [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=501.44s)]
*  as, quote, a people of no intelligence. Allah describes them as not of normal [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=506.15999999999997s)]
*  morality, as people of no intelligence, no morality, people of no intelligence, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=511.03999999999996s)]
*  because they're incapable of the intellectual effort it requires to shake off those blind [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=515.28s)]
*  prejudices, to shake off those easy assumptions about the world, about the [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=519.92s)]
*  existence of God. In this respect, the Quran describes the atheists as cattle, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=523.4399999999999s)]
*  as cattle of those who grow the crops and do not stop and wonder about this world. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=528.64s)]
*  All these ulama unanimously agree that at the very minimum, if Yazid was not a kaffir, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=534.0799999999999s)]
*  then at the very minimum, he was a fasik, a transgressor, a breaker of Islamic laws, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=541.4399999999999s)]
*  a corrupt individual, a tyrant, a killer, a drunkard, a dog lover, a music lover, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=546.88s)]
*  a homosexual, a pedophile, a sexual deviant, someone who slept with his own mother. These [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=551.6s)]
*  are their views. Not my view, he says. He's since apologized. They always apologize. The [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=556.24s)]
*  New York Times is endlessly apologizing. He's now a host on MSNBC. MSNBC host Ali Velshi's [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=562.8s)]
*  rabid, reckless anti-Israel rant, Jewish news syndicate. There wasn't violence. There wasn't [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=569.6s)]
*  bloodshed. MSNBC whitewashes Al Sharpton's history, the Daily Wire. MSNBC host Joy Reid [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=577.6s)]
*  criticized Jews, among others, anti-Semitic rants, homophobic rants, racist rants, anti-American [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=586.48s)]
*  rants. That was what they found on her blog. First she denied it was hers. She said somebody [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=595.6s)]
*  put it up and used her name. Of course, that was a lie. And now she's a weekday primetime host at [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=601.6s)]
*  MSNBC. I mean, honestly, they can't do better than this. Let's look at Media Matters, this Soros [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=609.76s)]
*  front group that he helped create. Media Matters is the research arm of the Democrat Party slash [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=616.24s)]
*  Hamas supporting slash America hating media in this country. That doesn't mean all the media, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=623.76s)]
*  but I've given you examples of many in the media, have I not? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=631.2s)]
*  Media Matters president, this is from the Daily Caller, wrote blog posts about Japs, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=635.0400000000001s)]
*  Jewry, and Trannies. It's so foul what this Media Matters president, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=641.0400000000001s)]
*  Angelo Carasone, wrote. I can't even read it to you. And this is the guy, and this is the operation. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=645.6s)]
*  If you go to their webpage now that's trying to destroy Fox and Rumble and individual hosts, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=651.44s)]
*  radio hosts, yours truly, and the media, the media use this as a source. CNN uses it. MSNBC [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=657.6s)]
*  uses it. New York Times, Washington Post, all the rest of them use it as a source. Why am I telling [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=665.6s)]
*  you all this? Because as I said at the start, when you have a situation like we have today, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=670.8800000000001s)]
*  when you have the greatest genocide and atrocities against a people, the Jewish people in Israel, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=678.16s)]
*  since the Holocaust, and I have to sit here and sit on radio and explain what the media are doing, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=685.28s)]
*  how they're lying in support of Hamas, how they're lying in support of terrorist regimes, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=695.04s)]
*  how they're lying against Israel, how they use anti-Semitic guests and hosts, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=701.9200000000001s)]
*  that's pretty sick. And now you know why this media cannot be trusted, the vast majority of it. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=710.64s)]
*  When they attack Trump, when they lie about the trials, when they lie about so much because they [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=717.6800000000001s)]
*  have an agenda, they have an ideology, and thanks to the Supreme Court, the New York Times decision [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=723.52s)]
*  Sullivan, most of this is protected. It wasn't protected at our founding when you actually could [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=731.1999999999999s)]
*  bring libel suits and win under state law. The court decided in the early 1960s that this was [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=738.3199999999999s)]
*  free speech and it was to be protected at all costs. Fine. The government doesn't interfere, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=745.04s)]
*  but what about individuals or groups of individuals? They can't reply. They have no [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=751.4399999999999s)]
*  standing to do anything, which is why it gets worse and worse and worse and worse. And frankly, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=759.12s)]
*  which is why it's an honor to work here at Fox and an honor to work at Westwood One on my radio show [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=765.84s)]
*  with this kind of evil and hate, these kinds of smears and libel which occur on a fairly regular [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=772.24s)]
*  basis in these newspapers, these cable channels, these network shows, simply does not occur. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl8U2iYuce4&t=778.72s)]
