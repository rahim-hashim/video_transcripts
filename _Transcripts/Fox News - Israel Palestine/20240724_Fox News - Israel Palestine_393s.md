# Domestic pressures are ‘allowing daylight’ between US, Israel: Lee Zeldin
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [July 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o)
*  With that, we bring in former Republican New York Congressman Lee Zeldin. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=0.0s)]
*  He sat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, also ran for governor here in New York, was one [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=3.44s)]
*  of only two GOP Jewish members of the House. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Lee Zeldin, welcome. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=11.96s)]
*  Always good to have you with us. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=12.96s)]
*  Your reaction to this speech by Prime Minister Netanyahu? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=14.08s)]
*  Strong, substantial. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=18.76s)]
*  I mean, factual, inspiring. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=21.76s)]
*  I think that not only people who care about the U.S.-Israel alliance should be tuning [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=25.36s)]
*  in and listening, but people who have been on the opposite side should be tuning in and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=29.08s)]
*  learning. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=33.08s)]
*  There's been a lot of propaganda that's been out there, a lot of allegations that have [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=34.08s)]
*  been made, and the prime minister didn't dodge or avoid talking about really the heart, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  the substance of the most important topics of the day. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=44.12s)]
*  He really dug into all of them. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=46.96s)]
*  I think it's great to see so many people inside of the halls of Congress, really from [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=49.2s)]
*  both sides of the aisle, who decided to be there. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=55.56s)]
*  And for those who weren't there, I would just say there's nowhere more important to be than [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=58.96s)]
*  in that chamber if you can be, especially if you're Kamala Harris, or tuning in if you're [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=62.68s)]
*  not. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=66.88s)]
*  You make a great point. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=67.88s)]
*  And I was watching some of the applause. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=69.88s)]
*  I saw Hakeem Jeffries and Katherine Clark applauding while Netanyahu was speaking, both [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=71.48s)]
*  obviously very prominent Democrats. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=76.92s)]
*  And you know, this is a forum, right? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  This is a moment. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=81.62s)]
*  And the decision to not be in the room, to not listen at all, really flies in the face [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=82.62s)]
*  of this idea that democracy is in danger. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=88.82000000000001s)]
*  This is an opportunity for democracy to function, to listen to the other side if you don't agree [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=94.38000000000001s)]
*  with this. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=101.02000000000001s)]
*  I just want to play a sound bite. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=102.02000000000001s)]
*  This is Kamala Harris, the vice president and now the presumed candidate of the Democrat [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=103.02000000000001s)]
*  Party a while back talking about really scolding Israel for their reaction to October 7th. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=108.58s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=115.12s)]
*  What we are seeing every day in Gaza is devastating. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=116.12s)]
*  The Israeli government must do more to significantly increase the flow of aid. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=121.36s)]
*  And given the immense scale of suffering in Gaza, there must be an immediate ceasefire. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=132.04s)]
*  That was back in March. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=141.42s)]
*  Your thoughts on that and on the fact that she is not present there today, Lee? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=148.66s)]
*  Well there's nowhere more important for Kamala Harris to be than there. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=154.18s)]
*  As far as the allegation that aid wasn't being delivered to Gaza, the prime minister [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=157.8s)]
*  pointed out that plenty of aid has been sent to Gaza and if it's not getting to the people [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=163.46s)]
*  who need it most, it's Hamas stealing it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=169.62s)]
*  The allegations about civilians who have been killed, the prime minister talking about how [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=172.4s)]
*  little casualties there are under the circumstances of urban warfare where Hamas is using civilians [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=178.70000000000002s)]
*  as human shields, where they're firing from schools, from mosques, from hospitals. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=185.54s)]
*  And what the Israelis do as a matter of practice and tactics, whether it is roof knocking, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=191.42s)]
*  it's dropping leaflets, it's text messages, it's phone calls, they give advanced warning [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=198.1s)]
*  and they end up with a military disadvantage for doing so, but it's an important tactic [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=203.39999999999998s)]
*  that they are pursuing because they understand the need to mitigate civilian casualties as [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=208.39999999999998s)]
*  much as possible. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=214.18s)]
*  So I think it's great that he was getting into the heart of that. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=215.18s)]
*  But back to Kamala Harris, she has time and again engaged in rhetoric with regards to [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=218.08s)]
*  what happened on October 7th, turning on Israel quickly, empowering people who are on college [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=223.94s)]
*  campuses and on the streets who have gone way beyond what is protected free speech. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=230.06s)]
*  And what really what a leader does in this moment is lead these people, especially those [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=234.68s)]
*  who follow you. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=240.10000000000002s)]
*  These people who are out on the streets right now outside the Capitol, these aren't people [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=241.32s)]
*  who voted for Donald Trump. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=244.56s)]
*  They're not people who vote Republican. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=246.10000000000002s)]
*  If they do show up and vote, they have an inclination to vote for Kamala Harris. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=248.08s)]
*  So speak to them, lead them as opposed to being led by them. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=253.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, there's always been tension between Israeli leaders and U.S. leaders in [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=256.12s)]
*  terms of the level of support over the years. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=260.72s)]
*  Just quickly, this is what happened when Netanyahu spoke about President Trump, who he will see [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=264.46000000000004s)]
*  later this week in Florida. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=269.48s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=270.92s)]
*  Trump for his leadership in brokering the stark Abraham Accords. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=275.0s)]
*  Like Americans, Israelis were relieved that President Trump emerged safe and sound from [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=280.35999999999996s)]
*  that dastardly attack on him, dastardly attack on American democracy. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=285.52s)]
*  There is no room for political violence in democracies. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=291.12s)]
*  What do you expect President Trump, the candidate for the GOP, will say to Netanyahu when they [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=295.0s)]
*  have that meeting in terms of where he stands on what must happen next year? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=300.86s)]
*  President Trump, I would imagine we'll be asking what else can we do in the United States? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=306.58s)]
*  President Trump, during his term in office, he launched the historic Abraham Accords. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=310.94s)]
*  He moved the embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=315.53999999999996s)]
*  recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, signed the Taylor Force Act into [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=320.38s)]
*  law, leveraged USAID to UNRWA and other United Nations agencies. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=324.78s)]
*  And now the real question is, what else can we do to strengthen this alliance, to help [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=330.06s)]
*  Israel during this difficult time with facing existential threats from all around? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=333.29999999999995s)]
*  And that's really what should happen, regardless of whether it's a Democratic administration [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=338.62s)]
*  or a Republican administration, regardless of whoever's in charge of Israel at any given [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=343.14s)]
*  time. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=347.65999999999997s)]
*  But unfortunately for domestic politics, and because of what's going on in Michigan and [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=348.65999999999997s)]
*  polling and an election coming up, we're seeing a lot of hedging, playing both sides [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=352.21999999999997s)]
*  and allowing daylight between our countries. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=357.09999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we need to be very aware that Iran has a heavy hand in all of this and that [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=358.98s)]
*  they are leveraging this. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=364.34s)]
*  There are reports that they're supporting these protest movements that we have seen [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=366.38s)]
*  out in the streets in Washington right now. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=371.42s)]
*  Lise Elden, thank you very much. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=373.02s)]
*  Good to have you with us. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=374.74s)]
*  And those are the larger Middle East tensions and questions that Kamala Harris and President [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=375.74s)]
*  Biden will need to deal with and President Trump as well if he succeeds in this election. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=380.14s)]
*  interviews and most compelling analysis. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=388.94s)]
*  You won't get it anywhere else. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VpMqGLHU7o&t=391.5s)]
