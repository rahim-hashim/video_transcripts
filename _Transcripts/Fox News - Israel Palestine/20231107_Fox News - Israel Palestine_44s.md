# MSNBC host shut down by Israel's former prime minister
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzJtfLTvkVU)
*  Former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett shutting down MSNBC's Katie Chur when she argued Israel did not give Gazans enough land when the Jewish state handed them territory back in 2005. Watch. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzJtfLTvkVU&t=0.0s)]
*  It wasn't like you handed over statehood to two states. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzJtfLTvkVU&t=12.0s)]
*  We actually did. It was theirs to decide. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzJtfLTvkVU&t=15.0s)]
*  But it wasn't connected with the West Bank. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzJtfLTvkVU&t=18.0s)]
*  But that's beside the point. We're talking about Gaza. The West Bank is the West Bank and Gaza is Gaza. They got everything they wanted. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzJtfLTvkVU&t=20.0s)]
*  Would you try that again? Would you experiment again after what they did? No one wants to try experiments, dangerous experiments again. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzJtfLTvkVU&t=28.0s)]
*  Bennett also rejecting calls for a ceasefire, saying Israel is being held to a, quote, different standard. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzJtfLTvkVU&t=37.0s)]
