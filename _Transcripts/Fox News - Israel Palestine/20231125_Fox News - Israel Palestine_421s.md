# Hamas is playing the entire world like a ‘violin’: Expert
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I)
*  Let's bring in Katie McFarland. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=0.0s)]
*  She's the former deputy national security advisor. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=1.24s)]
*  Katie, all these beautiful, welcome first of all [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=4.34s)]
*  and happy Thanksgiving to you. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=6.92s)]
*  Hope you had a wonderful time with your family. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=8.6s)]
*  These images are heartwarming. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=10.68s)]
*  They do bring a lot of, you know, hope, I'm sure, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=12.32s)]
*  to other families in Israel. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=15.92s)]
*  At the same time, we see Joe Biden taking a lot of credit, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=18.28s)]
*  but not many Americans in this first tranche [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=22.28s)]
*  of hostages that have come over. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  What do you make of how this has been handled, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=29.119999999999997s)]
*  having been in the Trump administration yourself [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=31.32s)]
*  and seeing how they handled situations with hostages [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=33.14s)]
*  and this situation? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=35.92s)]
*  Look, I mean, Hamas, they're playing the whole world [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=39.36s)]
*  like a violin. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=42.92s)]
*  The reason they took those grannies and those babies [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=44.36s)]
*  was they knew this moment would come. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=47.06s)]
*  They knew that they could string out a ceasefire, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=49.04s)]
*  some kind of a hostage exchange. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=52.7s)]
*  They know they can't defeat Israel militarily [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=55.32s)]
*  or economically, but they can psychologically. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=57.68s)]
*  And that's why they're doing this. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  Now, of course, no Americans were in that first tranche. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=61.4s)]
*  They're gonna dribble those Americans out [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=63.76s)]
*  until the very end. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=65.36s)]
*  What they want, they wanna buy time. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=66.56s)]
*  Hamas buys time and what does it do with that time? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=68.58s)]
*  It regroups, it rearms, and it gets ready [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=71.28s)]
*  for another round of fighting [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=74.52s)]
*  to destroy the state of Israel. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=75.92s)]
*  And yet, I can't watch those. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I've got little grandchildren. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=80.2s)]
*  I watch those pictures. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=81.8s)]
*  My heart is tugged for the families [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=83.36s)]
*  and what they're experiencing [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=86.54s)]
*  and the worry, are they gonna get [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=88.02000000000001s)]
*  their little grandchildren back? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=89.52000000000001s)]
*  It just breaks your heart. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=91.66000000000001s)]
*  And Hamas knows that's what it's gonna do. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=92.98s)]
*  And so that's why they're doing it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=94.94000000000001s)]
*  They wanna buy time and ultimately, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=96.62s)]
*  they wanna look like the good guys in this. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=98.82000000000001s)]
*  They wanna look like the good guys [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=101.06s)]
*  who have taken good care of those kids [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=102.7s)]
*  and they're releasing them to their families. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=104.9s)]
*  And what they wanna do is have the whole world [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=107.14000000000001s)]
*  turn against Israel. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=110.26s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I don't know. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=113.58000000000001s)]
*  I don't think Hamas comes out looking so good, Katie. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=115.14s)]
*  I mean, in the end, we all know [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=117.5s)]
*  that these are innocent civilians. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=119.02s)]
*  Just think of those pictures that you've just shown. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=123.54s)]
*  It's the kids are looking okay. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=126.02s)]
*  The grandmothers look like they're okay. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=127.54s)]
*  And Hamas, they get what they want out of this. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=129.46s)]
*  They get the picture of the humanitarians [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=132.06s)]
*  who are releasing it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=133.9s)]
*  Contrast that to the pictures of Israel [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=134.98s)]
*  going after Gaza where you see level buildings. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=137.22s)]
*  Believe me, they're turning the public narrative [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=140.1s)]
*  against Israel. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=142.48s)]
*  And the longer this goes on, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=144.06s)]
*  the longer the hostage situation is dribbled out. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=146.14000000000001s)]
*  And remember, they're getting an exchange [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=148.7s)]
*  for the grannies and the babies. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=151.08s)]
*  What are they getting in exchange? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=152.78s)]
*  Israel doesn't have hostages that are grannies and babies. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=154.1s)]
*  Israel has terrorists who are in jail. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=157.4s)]
*  That's who they're getting exchanged for. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=159.98s)]
*  So, okay, so, but we've all thought [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=162.14000000000001s)]
*  we could never be more horrified [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=164.32s)]
*  than the pictures we saw in October [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=166.0s)]
*  of the killing of the Israel, the slaughter of the innocents. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=168.18s)]
*  But those pictures have been replaced. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=171.32s)]
*  And you're already seeing [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=173.5s)]
*  the anti-Israel demonstrations in Europe. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=175.26000000000002s)]
*  You're already seeing China, Russia, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=177.58s)]
*  everybody coming out and saying, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=179.94s)]
*  this is all Israel's fault. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=181.10000000000002s)]
*  You're seeing this on American college campuses. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=182.58s)]
*  And you're seeing it at the base of the Democrat party. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=184.5s)]
*  I'm really surprised that President Biden [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=186.86s)]
*  has stuck with Israel as long as he has. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=188.86s)]
*  But the calls for making this cease-file [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=192.08s)]
*  not just temporary, but permanent, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=194.14000000000001s)]
*  are gonna start next week, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=196.70000000000002s)]
*  and they're gonna be louder and louder and louder. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=198.74s)]
*  And yet Israel, if they don't destroy Hamas, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=200.7s)]
*  if they don't destroy those weapons cases, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=203.45999999999998s)]
*  if they don't take out those military commanders, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=205.14s)]
*  Israel's gonna have the same fight two years later. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=207.42s)]
*  KT, we're just getting news, breaking news, in fact. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=210.06s)]
*  Reuters reporting that Egypt has received positive signals [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=212.54s)]
*  from all parties for an extension of Gaza truce [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=215.61999999999998s)]
*  for one or two more days. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=219.28s)]
*  Your reaction to that, and do you think [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=221.06s)]
*  that the release of hostages we are expected to see [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=224.38s)]
*  at any moment now will go as smoothly today [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=226.57999999999998s)]
*  as it did yesterday? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=230.02s)]
*  I have every confidence [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=234.66s)]
*  that they're gonna make the Palestinian, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=235.82000000000002s)]
*  that Hamas is gonna make this work. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=237.18s)]
*  They're gonna have these hostage releases go slowly, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=239.10000000000002s)]
*  carefully, and they're gonna release the hostages. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=242.3s)]
*  But they got a lot of hostages. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=244.88s)]
*  And this could stretch on, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=246.38s)]
*  not just for a day or two or a week, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=247.54000000000002s)]
*  this could stretch on for a month. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=249.42000000000002s)]
*  And at that point, the world is gonna say, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=250.86s)]
*  look, we've had a cease-fire, let's stop the killing, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=252.78s)]
*  let's just be done with it, no more fighting. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=255.62s)]
*  And that's where Israel is gonna have a hard time [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=257.8s)]
*  because if Israel isn't backstopped by the United States [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=259.9s)]
*  with weapons resupply, if Israel has to figure out [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=262.73999999999995s)]
*  how to have an economy that works [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=266.14s)]
*  when most of its population, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=267.67999999999995s)]
*  the producers of the population of Israel, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=269.41999999999996s)]
*  it's a high-tech society, they're all being, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=271.97999999999996s)]
*  in the military right now, they've all been called up. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=273.96s)]
*  Israel's playing against the calendar. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=276.26s)]
*  They're playing against the clock. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=278.06s)]
*  They're playing against time. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=279.34s)]
*  And Hamas, they wanna stretch this out as long as they can. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=280.84s)]
*  Yeah, and part of this is how much does Hamas speak [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=284.65999999999997s)]
*  for Hezbollah or the Houthis or other organizations [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=286.72s)]
*  that are loosely connected or are upset at Israel [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=290.68s)]
*  through this fight in other places? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=293.36s)]
*  There have been 73 attacks on United States forces [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=295.08000000000004s)]
*  in Iraq and Syria alone. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=298.72s)]
*  You know, I sit this out looking, I go, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=300.76000000000005s)]
*  Americans were killed on October 7th, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=302.68s)]
*  they were taken captive. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=304.40000000000003s)]
*  We have American military in the Mediterranean [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=305.44000000000005s)]
*  and the American military is getting attacked daily. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=307.6s)]
*  Is America at war here and we don't even know it? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=310.90000000000003s)]
*  You know, this is the sort of story [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=314.35999999999996s)]
*  that nobody's really reporting and I'm really glad [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=316.64s)]
*  you brought it up because this is all Iran. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=318.59999999999997s)]
*  What does Iran wanna do in the Middle East? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=321.52s)]
*  Well, they wanna destroy Israel, they wanna kill Jews, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=323.2s)]
*  but they really want America out of the Middle East [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=325.67999999999995s)]
*  and they're gonna chip away at it. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=327.64s)]
*  They're gonna chip away at American presence there, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=329.52s)]
*  so they're gonna do these sort of one-off attacks here, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=331.71999999999997s)]
*  there, they're kind of provoking an attack. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=334.35999999999996s)]
*  And what happens if an American gets killed? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=336.52s)]
*  I mean, I think it's amazing that with all these attacks [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=338.76s)]
*  that have happened in the last couple of weeks, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=341.88s)]
*  that an American hasn't gotten killed. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=345.52s)]
*  What happens if an American gets killed? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=347.64s)]
*  Are we then in a war with Iran, like you said? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=349.64s)]
*  America doesn't let American citizens [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=352.28000000000003s)]
*  get killed without response. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=354.2s)]
*  So this situation is not over and I'm very concerned [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=355.8s)]
*  that it could escalate, not because anybody in America [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=360.0s)]
*  wants a war or because really Iran doesn't want a war either. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=362.24s)]
*  They just want America out of the Middle East, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=365.84000000000003s)]
*  the same way the Palestinians want Israelis and Jews [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=367.24s)]
*  out of the Palestinian, out of the area that, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=371.2s)]
*  between they say the West Bank, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=373.76s)]
*  the river of the Jordan River and the sea. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=375.96000000000004s)]
*  The chant is get Israel out, get the Jews [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=378.6s)]
*  out of all the areas of Israel. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=381.8s)]
*  Remember, Gaza is not an occupied country right now. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=383.76s)]
*  It's not an occupied territory. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=386.92s)]
*  The Israelis, they left 15 years ago. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=388.48s)]
*  That what they want is they want all the Jews [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=391.56s)]
*  and all the Israelis to get out of the region. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=393.8s)]
*  And so does Iran. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=396.2s)]
*  Iran wants Israel out and they want America out. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=397.32s)]
*  And they're doing it by playing on the psychological weapons [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=399.68s)]
*  that they have at their disposal. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv4hJFLQ0I&t=403.47999999999996s)]
