# ‘No stopwatch’ on defeating Hamas: Dr. Ophir Falk
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM)
*  Hamas will not be in control after it is done. David. Matt Finn, thank you very much. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=0.0s)]
*  So Israel is under intense pressure from all sides as the war heads into the new year. Foreign policy [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Dr. Ofeer Fok joins me now. Dr, thank you for [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=10.72s)]
*  being here. Happy New Year to you. When will the IDF be able to claim victory against Hamas? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=17.36s)]
*  Thank you for having me, David. The IDF will claim victory in this war once Hamas is destroyed and we [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=24.08s)]
*  free the hostages. That was the clear mandate that Netanyahu's war cabinet gave the IDF at the outset, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=33.92s)]
*  destroy Hamas and free the hostages. That's exactly what the IDF is doing now. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=41.04s)]
*  But you have no idea how long that will take to reach that goal. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  Right. So we don't have a stopwatch on this. It could take a week, it could take a month, it could take a year. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=50.8s)]
*  But what we have to do is to win this thing and to destroy Hamas. That's our only alternative. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=57.599999999999994s)]
*  That's the goal and that is exactly what the IDF is doing right now, destroying Hamas. Sorry, go ahead. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=65.6s)]
*  No, I'm just asking what would happen after that? Let's assume that you succeed in your mission, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  and we hope you do, but what happens after that? Who will control the area of Gaza? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  Right. So the Prime Minister actually laid down a very clear plan on that. One, we have to destroy Hamas. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=85.19999999999999s)]
*  After we destroy Hamas, that it can't serve as a threat to anybody on Earth, we have to demilitarize Gaza [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=91.83999999999999s)]
*  so that there will be no threat to Israel from Gaza. And three, we have to deradicalize Gaza and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=98.24s)]
*  the Palestinian society so that children will no longer be taught to cherish death, but to rather [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=107.6s)]
*  love life. They will no longer be taught to murder Jews, but rather they'll want to live side by side [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=113.84s)]
*  in peace with Israel. When that happens, there will also be peace. Once the deradicalization [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=120.96s)]
*  process begins, Gaza can be rebuilt. It can't be rebuilt, and then there will be prospects for peace, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=127.04s)]
*  not only with our near neighbors, but well beyond that. But can you think of any Palestinian [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=134.8s)]
*  controlled areas, whether it's Gaza or the West Bank, where education, for example, does [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=140.48000000000002s)]
*  teach a story of getting along with the Israelis rather than killing them? I mean, I can't. We know [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=147.68s)]
*  the UN has been complicit in coming out with Hamas-style propaganda in the schools. I mean, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=153.36s)]
*  you would have to take over the entire education system, would you not, of Gaza? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=159.36s)]
*  Well, I think deradicalization is not science fiction. It can happen. It happened [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  after World War II. It happened in Germany and Japan. It was de-Nazif-kite, and Japan also [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=170.96s)]
*  became deradicalized within five or seven years. They became close allies of the United States. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=177.76s)]
*  Today, they push for peace and prosperity throughout the world. More recently, after 9-11, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=184.48s)]
*  visionary leaders in the Gulf states deradicalized their population. If you go to the Gulf states, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=191.28s)]
*  if you go to the UAE on Friday mornings, you will hear peaceful sermons in the mosques. You won't [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=198.0s)]
*  hear them calling for murder, and they don't hate Jews there. So I don't think that is a [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=205.52s)]
*  science fiction. I think it's very possible. And frankly, there is no other alternative. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=210.96s)]
*  There's frankly no other alternative. But it is a tall order. And again, I just remember what the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=215.12s)]
*  Palestinian Authority did when they were competing with Hamas, what happened to them. Hamas literally [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=220.32000000000002s)]
*  killed their rivals in order to take all control. I mean, it is a very tall order. Let me just ask [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=227.28s)]
*  you about, though, that you mentioned what's happening in the other Arab states. One of the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=233.12s)]
*  reasons I think Iran was behind the October 7th massacre, etc., is because they were so upset at [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=237.44s)]
*  the progress that had been made in the Abraham Accords between Arab states and Israel. And there [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=243.44s)]
*  was, there has been a change in these Arab states to recognize Israel that you never thought [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=249.76s)]
*  imaginable 15 or 20 years ago. Is that now dead because of what's happened on October 7th and [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=254.72s)]
*  the time since? No, absolutely not, David. You're right. The main objective of Hamas on October 7th, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=262.8s)]
*  they had three objectives. One was to murder Jews. That's in their charter. They are a genocidal, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=272.08s)]
*  sick terrorist organization that their charter calls for the murder of Jews. Two, their second [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=277.6s)]
*  objective was to take Jews hostage, Israelis hostage to leverage that. And three was to derail [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=283.36s)]
*  the prospects for peace in the region. Our objective, Israel's objective, as detailed by [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=290.48s)]
*  Netanyahu's war cabinet, is to destroy Hamas. That's what the IDF is doing right now, to free [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=298.08000000000004s)]
*  the hostages. And once we have that, it'll be much easier to have prospects for peace in the region, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=304.40000000000003s)]
*  in the very near region and beyond. We're actually optimistic that that is possible. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=311.12s)]
*  You think it's possible to get back on track, but the Iranians, frankly, I think they believe that [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=316.40000000000003s)]
*  they're on their way to winning. Let's face it, what they want to do is take over the entire Muslim [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=321.76000000000005s)]
*  world. They want to transplant themselves in the roles that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=327.36s)]
*  Emirates and other Arab states now have. And they think they're on their way to do that. In fact, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=333.44000000000005s)]
*  in the United States, the support for Israel in the past month or so has gone down, partly because [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=339.04s)]
*  their propaganda efforts have been so successful. Right. So actually Prime Minister Netanyahu has [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=345.84s)]
*  been warning against these, the tyrants from Tehran from July 1996, when he gave a speech before [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=352.64s)]
*  Congress. Iran is the major threat. It's a huge threat, not only to Israel, not only to the Middle [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=359.84s)]
*  East, but to the world at large. I think most countries understand that today. Our allies [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=366.23999999999995s)]
*  understand that today. And actually we've had great support, great support from the United States, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=372.88s)]
*  from President Biden, bipartisan support from the American Congress, and actually from the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=378.48s)]
*  American people. And we appreciate that dearly. Well, Dr. Fock, we wish you the very best [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=385.68s)]
*  in the new year. We hope it's more peaceful than the last year has been. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=391.52s)]
*  Thank you very much for being here. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilmeade. And I'm Ainsley [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYGpu4ovbM&t=394.88s)]
