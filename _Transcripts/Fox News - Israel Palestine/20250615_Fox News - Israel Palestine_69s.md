# Crews work to rescue victims after devastating Iranian strikes #shorts  #foxnews #iran #israel #news
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [June 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFn3DQxbLR8)
*  I want to just show you, because these crews, now that they moved this large block, they [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFn3DQxbLR8&t=0.0s)]
*  are now digging once again, trying to get to some of the people that are trapped under [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFn3DQxbLR8&t=4.96s)]
*  the rubble. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFn3DQxbLR8&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  I do, again, just want to tell you the story of this son who is waiting just a block away [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFn3DQxbLR8&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  from where we're standing. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFn3DQxbLR8&t=15.98s)]
*  And when we arrived, he was sitting in a wheelchair, dressed in a hospital gown. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFn3DQxbLR8&t=17.6s)]
*  And he was staring into the distance. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFn3DQxbLR8&t=22.42s)]
*  And it looked like his girlfriend or his wife was sitting next to him, holding his hand. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFn3DQxbLR8&t=24.16s)]
*  And a family friend came up to our crew, and we talked to him. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFn3DQxbLR8&t=29.58s)]
*  And he said, our friend is trapped under the rubble. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFn3DQxbLR8&t=32.82s)]
*  And he was talking about the father of this man. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFn3DQxbLR8&t=34.7s)]
*  And he said he's 50 years old. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFn3DQxbLR8&t=38.18s)]
*  His name is Mer. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFn3DQxbLR8&t=40.06s)]
*  And he was a kind man who lived in this building. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFn3DQxbLR8&t=41.92s)]
*  But he went out of the shelter to get his phone. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFn3DQxbLR8&t=45.5s)]
*  And that's when the blast happened. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFn3DQxbLR8&t=48.16s)]
*  His son was injured again, taken to a local hospital. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFn3DQxbLR8&t=50.18s)]
*  And the son, although he was wounded, demanded that the team of doctors and nurses take him [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFn3DQxbLR8&t=52.86s)]
*  back to the blast site just hours after, still in his hospital gown and wheelchair, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFn3DQxbLR8&t=59.08s)]
*  to wait for his father to be pulled from the rubble. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFn3DQxbLR8&t=63.879999999999995s)]
