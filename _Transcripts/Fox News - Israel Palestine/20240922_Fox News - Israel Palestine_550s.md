# Donald Trump himself is a deterrent: Gov. Doug Burgum
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [September 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU)
*  Okay, joining us now, Governor Doug Burgum of North Dakota. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=0.0s)]
*  He's just landed back from that trip as we announced earlier. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=3.04s)]
*  So Governor, what do you make of that? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=6.92s)]
*  You heard the Admiral's explanation that they have been tough on Iran and that they haven't [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=9.52s)]
*  kind of let up on that pressure. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=13.3s)]
*  Well, I don't think the facts on the ground match the talking points here because as you [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=14.88s)]
*  noted, October 8th last year, October 7th, we had these atrocities. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=22.04s)]
*  When I was in Israel, we had a chance to walk in the footsteps, meet the families of people [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=26.72s)]
*  whose parents and children had been kidnapped, executed, mutilated, burned in their homes. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  That all that we all know happened in record level of hostage taking just on October 7th, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=37.96s)]
*  about a month or so after we gave $6 billion to Iran for five hostages. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  We raised the incentive for hostage taking over a year ago. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=50.24s)]
*  And then as you said, the next day on October 8th, the rockets started coming from Hezbollah [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=54.88s)]
*  into Israel. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=59.080000000000005s)]
*  And as you said, then we've got a whole 60, 70,000 people that have had to leave their [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=60.080000000000005s)]
*  homes. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=65.0s)]
*  There have been 8,500 rockets fired from Hezbollah since last year on October 8th into Israel. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=66.0s)]
*  So people talk about this being an escalation. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=72.6s)]
*  This is just the response. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=74.9s)]
*  I mean, I think October 7th is like Israel's 9-11, but it would be like a 9-11 where then [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=76.16s)]
*  you have the atrocities of that day, then people move into southern Manhattan and start [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=83.64s)]
*  slaughtering and burning innocent families. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=88.44s)]
*  And then a terrorist group sets up in New Jersey and every day launches rockets into [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=90.44s)]
*  southern Manhattan. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=95.12s)]
*  I mean, that's the equivalent of what the Israelis are going through. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=96.12s)]
*  So we have a responsibility to stand in solidarity with Israel. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=98.76s)]
*  But if you want to stop the escalation, we have to put maximum pressure on Iran. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=104.18s)]
*  We're not doing that under this administration. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=109.24000000000001s)]
*  President Trump did that. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=111.32s)]
*  President Trump was proven that he was able to financially reduce Iran's ability to fund [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=112.36s)]
*  all these terrorists. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=117.55999999999999s)]
*  They're the world's largest funder of terrorism. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=118.55999999999999s)]
*  And one of the facts you have to look at is their oil exports. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=120.36s)]
*  Their oil production and their oil exports are way up. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=122.67999999999999s)]
*  And so Iran is funding this seven-front war. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  And then this current administration, the appeasement parade continues. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=129.2s)]
*  There was just news out at the end of this week that we're going to announce next week [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=133.68s)]
*  about troop withdrawals from Iraq. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=137.56s)]
*  Iraq fired missiles at Israel last night. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=139.48000000000002s)]
*  The Houthis fired missiles. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=142.44s)]
*  We're firing missiles at Ben Gurion Airport last Sunday. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=144.6s)]
*  I mean, they're taking fire from seven different groups right now, all funded by Iran. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=147.08s)]
*  But to the to the Admiral's point, they have levied hundreds of new rounds of sanctions [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=151.8s)]
*  on Iran. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=156.04000000000002s)]
*  We have beefed up the U.S. presence militarily in the region. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  Fair to give them any credit for those efforts? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=160.96s)]
*  Well, I think this is like saying that they, you know, these numbers, 600 sanctions, they [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  have 500 sanctions on Russia. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=166.48s)]
*  And Russia is funding a war in Ukraine based on their oil production. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=168.72s)]
*  So the sanctions that they're putting on individuals, they get a big number that creates a talking [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=173.1s)]
*  point. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=177.16s)]
*  But they're not working. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=178.16s)]
*  They're not working because Hamas's budget has gone up triple. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=179.16s)]
*  If the sanctions are working, their budget would be lower. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=183.12s)]
*  Hezbollah, they fired 8,500 missiles in the last year. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=186.12s)]
*  In the last month, that's more than one an hour coming in. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=189.48s)]
*  But they've got 100, they've stockpiled 130,000 missiles. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=192.67999999999998s)]
*  These missiles, you know, Israel, they criticize Israel for responding to its attacks with [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=195.84s)]
*  the most precision we've ever seen in warfare ever. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=201.39999999999998s)]
*  If it's a 1% civilian casualties, the number of terrorists taking out, they're complaining. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=204.88s)]
*  Meanwhile, these missiles that are coming into Israel, these aren't precision guided [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=209.48s)]
*  missiles. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=213.23999999999998s)]
*  They're not anti-tank missiles. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=214.23999999999998s)]
*  They're anti-house. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=215.23999999999998s)]
*  They're indiscriminately launching missiles into communities. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=216.23999999999998s)]
*  And where's the outrage about that? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=219.72s)]
*  Again, as one of your quotes, because Israel is good at knocking missiles out of the air, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=223.0s)]
*  then somehow that doesn't make Hezbollah the bad guy. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=227.92s)]
*  They're literally shooting into communities, schools, and homes daily. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=232.0s)]
*  And now those have just ramped up. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=237.04s)]
*  Last night, hundreds more. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=238.84s)]
*  Does the US, though, have a moral obligation to raise the concerns about tens of thousands [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=239.84s)]
*  of civilians in Gaza losing their lives who are not combatants in this war? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=244.39999999999998s)]
*  There's never been a battle in American history, world history, the history of warfare that [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=250.84s)]
*  has been so thoughtful about trying to move civilians out of harm's way. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=256.64s)]
*  I mean, think about Hamas and all these terrorist groups. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=260.96000000000004s)]
*  This is not—we're in a different era. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=263.56s)]
*  They get more international support when more civilians die. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=266.88s)]
*  That's why their leaders wrap themselves sometimes even with their own families. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=270.64s)]
*  That's why they've got to build headquarters under schools and hospitals because when you [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=274.0s)]
*  come to try to take out the bad guys, if they're civilian, it increases their international support. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=278.24s)]
*  They literally—Hamas is supposed to be leading that in Gaza. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=282.68s)]
*  They have a reverse incentive to actually protect civilians. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=286.8s)]
*  They're better off in terms of their funding and international support from places like the UN. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=291.28s)]
*  And the UN was also complicit because UNRWA has been funneling money in there, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=295.71999999999997s)]
*  and some of the Hamas headquarters were underneath UNRWA buildings. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=300.36s)]
*  And so it's completely hypocrisy for the UN to be able to say that somehow Israel is at fault here. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=303.16s)]
*  It'll be very interesting to see the speeches next week at the General Assembly and what our [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=311.2s)]
*  president has to say about all of those issues. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=314.6s)]
*  But let me talk to you about the man who wants to be president on your side of the ticket [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=317.36s)]
*  because he is going to have to, if he's re-elected, confront all of these issues. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=321.64s)]
*  Financial resources are part of this puzzle. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=326.2s)]
*  And the latest FEC filings show that the Harris campaign has an enormous financial advantage [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=328.88s)]
*  based on what they've got, what they're spending, and what's still left in the bank. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=334.71999999999997s)]
*  Time is also, though, a resource, and it's ticking down. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=338.23999999999995s)]
*  Karl Rove writes this in The Wall Street Journal. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=340.79999999999995s)]
*  He says, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=342.44s)]
*  The argument is that President Trump has good arguments against her on all of those issues. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=343.32s)]
*  Do you talk to him about strategy? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=359.2s)]
*  Is he willing to be more focused on the issues, or does he see a need for that? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=361.24s)]
*  Well, I think we all know that, and the voters know that President Trump, if we're talking about [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=365.15999999999997s)]
*  the economy, the economy was super strong under President Trump, and it's been awful [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=371.8s)]
*  under Biden and Harris. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=374.84000000000003s)]
*  Interest rates, inflation, the cost of a home, price of food, price of gasoline, President [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=377.56s)]
*  Trump wins on those. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=382.32s)]
*  On national security, all these issues we talked about, literally he's a deterrent. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=383.44s)]
*  If you want to see the hostages come home, vote for Donald Trump because we will see [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=387.36s)]
*  exactly like we did when Jimmy Carter left office on the first day, Ronald Reagan, the [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=392.08s)]
*  hostages came home. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=396.64s)]
*  That will happen again because Iran knows that President Trump will be coming with sanctions [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=397.64s)]
*  and with things that will put them back where they were before when he was in office. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=402.4s)]
*  I got to stop you there because that's going to be a tough thing for families at home to [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=406.64s)]
*  hear. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=409.4s)]
*  You got to believe that this administration is trying to get them home. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=410.8s)]
*  Well I believe it, but I also believe that the appeasement parade that goes on from the [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=413.68s)]
*  Harris-Biden administration is what's escalating the war. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=417.68s)]
*  Every time Hamas hears for an official or Harris or Biden to say, we need to go for [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=421.4s)]
*  a ceasefire, we can't escalate, they go, great, we can just hang on until November 5th. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=426.8s)]
*  She might win. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=431.03999999999996s)]
*  If she wins, we're going to get even a better deal. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=432.03999999999996s)]
*  We might get a billion dollars a hostage. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=433.4s)]
*  So the weakness and the closeness of the election is actually an incentive for Hamas and others [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=436.24s)]
*  to not cut deals. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=441.5s)]
*  President Trump himself is a deterrent. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=443.0s)]
*  President Trump will help end and de-escalate this. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=446.15999999999997s)]
*  In the meantime, Israel is doing what they need to do to reduce the capability of an [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=448.84s)]
*  enemy that's on their border that's attacking their citizens. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=453.08s)]
*  Here we go, because we got to go. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=456.44s)]
*  I got to ask you quickly. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=457.44s)]
*  The Vice President says she wants another debate on October 23rd. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=458.44s)]
*  President Trump doesn't sound like he's into it. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=461.2s)]
*  What would you advise him? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=463.15999999999997s)]
*  Should he do it? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=464.15999999999997s)]
*  Well he's already done two debates. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=465.15999999999997s)]
*  Only one with her? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=466.15999999999997s)]
*  Yes, but I don't know if he, but we know his position. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=467.15999999999997s)]
*  He's the most well understood candidate, the most authentic. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=470.91999999999996s)]
*  He says what he thinks and everybody understands it. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=474.85999999999996s)]
*  She is the least known, least understood candidate ever running for history. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=477.76s)]
*  What we need is for her, for the press to actually, we don't need to debate. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=482.35999999999996s)]
*  They don't have to wait for the next debate to ask her the questions about what would [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=485.72s)]
*  she do about all of these issues. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=488.88000000000005s)]
*  But we just don't know. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=492.16s)]
*  We can only assume it's going to carry on, which again, with President Trump it was peace [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=493.24s)]
*  abroad and prosperity at home. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=497.96000000000004s)]
*  And under the Biden and Harris administration it's been the opposite. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=500.06s)]
*  Our economy's in the tank and the world is exploding. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=502.88000000000005s)]
*  And the last thing I need to say is Iran is closer than ever to getting a nuclear weapon [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=505.40000000000003s)]
*  under the appeasement we have. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=509.56s)]
*  Every American should understand, every American that cares about democracy and cares about [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=512.1s)]
*  Israel should be saying we have to get President Trump. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=517.0600000000001s)]
*  The leaders of the world need him back in. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=519.9s)]
*  Strength is what will help de-escalate these tensions in the world. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=521.74s)]
*  Yeah, the assessments of Iran's nuclear program are very frightening. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=525.22s)]
*  Governor, thank you for making the time. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZy0w_1wyZU&t=527.74s)]
