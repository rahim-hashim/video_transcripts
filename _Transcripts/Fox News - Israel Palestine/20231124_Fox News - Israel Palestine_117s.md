# Trey Yingst: This has been an 'agonizing' seven weeks
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsvKCfTJKhM)
*  We're going to go to Trey Yengst. He's joining us live at that airbase. Hey, Trey. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsvKCfTJKhM&t=0.0s)]
*  Hey, Julie. Good morning. Reports do indicate those 13 hostages are now in Egypt. They were [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsvKCfTJKhM&t=6.4s)]
*  greeted by Shin Bet officers from Israeli intelligence to confirm their identities, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsvKCfTJKhM&t=12.16s)]
*  and they are headed to Israel. We are told the Red Cross facilitating that release from Hamas [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsvKCfTJKhM&t=17.36s)]
*  custody to the Red Cross and ultimately to Israel. This has been an agonizing nearly seven weeks for [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsvKCfTJKhM&t=22.88s)]
*  the Israeli population that ceasefire going into effect 11 hours ago, and it does appear to be [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsvKCfTJKhM&t=29.04s)]
*  holding for now as this process plays out for the hostages. We are at the Hatzareem airbase in [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsvKCfTJKhM&t=34.72s)]
*  southern Israel outside of the city of Be'er Sheva. This is the first location in Israel that the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsvKCfTJKhM&t=40.24s)]
*  hostages will come to. We're not sure yet if they'll arrive here by helicopter or by bus, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsvKCfTJKhM&t=45.68s)]
*  but once here they will be medically evaluated. They'll be able to make phone calls with loved [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsvKCfTJKhM&t=51.2s)]
*  ones, and then ultimately they will be transferred to other medical facilities or centers across [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsvKCfTJKhM&t=56.0s)]
*  Israel. This has been just a moment of anticipation for the Israeli population as they watch this play [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsvKCfTJKhM&t=61.68s)]
*  out. The Israeli military and government trying to do everything they can for these hostages. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsvKCfTJKhM&t=68.32s)]
*  We saw ambulances arriving here earlier today. We've also seen video of the noise-canceling [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsvKCfTJKhM&t=72.56s)]
*  headphones, the sunglasses, the blankets, just anything that they can do to make these hostages [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsvKCfTJKhM&t=77.6s)]
*  comfortable when they are released. Remember, we're talking about 13 people here, women and [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsvKCfTJKhM&t=82.64s)]
*  children, and they are being exchanged for 24 female Palestinian prisoners and 15 male Palestinian [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsvKCfTJKhM&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  teenagers. As we push forward in this story, the break in the fighting expected to last for four [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsvKCfTJKhM&t=93.28s)]
*  days, and if it goes as planned, could see 50 Israeli hostages released in exchange for 150 [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsvKCfTJKhM&t=98.8s)]
*  Palestinian prisoners. Remember, though, that tension on the ground as thousands of Israeli [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsvKCfTJKhM&t=104.72s)]
*  infantry troops continue to operate inside Gaza. They are holding their fire for now, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsvKCfTJKhM&t=109.28s)]
*  but prepared for anything in the coming days. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsvKCfTJKhM&t=114.24s)]
