# Morgan Ortagus: 'It's terrifying to be a Jewish parent right now'
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE)
*  Doug, I saw you nodding several times. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=0.0s)]
*  What was Brett saying that was resonating with? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=2.32s)]
*  Because you serve so you know that was resonating with you in terms of [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=4.92s)]
*  strategy of the idea. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=8.94s)]
*  Well, the biggest thing that was resonating with me was actually this. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=10.74s)]
*  He was looking at this was a slow and methodical even pulling up the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  reserves. Remember the reserves had to be trained up. They had, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=16.62s)]
*  they're different than our reserve forces, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=19.12s)]
*  so they have to be trained up to get ready to go back in. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=20.78s)]
*  So that methodical process, that's why they just didn't go in immediately. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=22.8s)]
*  And for all the discussion for the Biden administration about taking it slowly, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=26.28s)]
*  well, that's exactly what they're doing and they're making sure that they go [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=30.04s)]
*  through it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=32.16s)]
*  Here's the interesting part that I'm going to look at for the next few days is [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=32.72s)]
*  not necessarily what's going on in Gaza, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=36.4s)]
*  which we know is happening there Hamas there is what will happen with Iran and [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=37.92s)]
*  the Iran back military groups and also Lebanon Hezbollah. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=41.24s)]
*  That is the one right now that you have to worry about because they have said [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=44.32s)]
*  they will do a proportional response, whatever that means to them. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=47.1s)]
*  So if all of a sudden they come across that Northern border, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=50.3s)]
*  you'll see a complete shift in this war. It'll go from Gaza to there. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  Gaza will be maintained while you have to face off that. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=56.96s)]
*  Well in Iran, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=60.36s)]
*  technically Morgan would have more control over that situation because they [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=61.2s)]
*  know that Hezbollah has up to 150,000 rockets that they can hit that very city [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=64.76s)]
*  that Brett Velikovitch was in Tel Aviv. They can hit Jerusalem. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=69.16s)]
*  They can hit wherever they want in the nation of Israel. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=72.2s)]
*  My question is though, where is Saudi Arabia? Where is Jordan? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=76.6s)]
*  Where is Qatar? For that matter, you know, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=81.12s)]
*  any Arab nation nearby that has said that they want to have some kind of [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  relations with us and we want to have some kind of relations with them. Egypt, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=88.56s)]
*  Egypt kicked a lot of Palestinians out already. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=93.36s)]
*  So we sort of know where they are, but they are sending aid. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=95.56s)]
*  Why don't they take care of their own Arab nation people? Why don't they do that? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=98.52000000000001s)]
*  We saw this for a decade in the Syrian civil war. Uh, when we had, you know, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=102.16s)]
*  millions of Syrians that were injured, that were displaced, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=107.02000000000001s)]
*  that were killed by Assad. You know, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=110.16s)]
*  it's, it's, it's kind of interesting to see these worldwide protests for the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=112.12s)]
*  Palestinians. Um, I want to know where all these people were for a decade of [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=115.28s)]
*  Syrian civil war. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=118.8s)]
*  I want to know where they are now. Yeah. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=119.64s)]
*  So I think there's something really interesting going on with Saudi Arabia [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=121.88s)]
*  right now. Um, MBS, the crown prince is not, you know, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=125.48s)]
*  he was very much working towards trying to get peace and recognition with [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=129.2s)]
*  Israel, essentially entering the Abraham Accords or something even bigger. Um, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=132.52s)]
*  he has not, uh, dismissed that he has not set, you know, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=137.16s)]
*  there's realities of the situation on the ground, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=140.48000000000002s)]
*  but all indications is that Saudi is going to possibly move forward. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=142.88s)]
*  Also it's been reported publicly that some of the missiles that the Houthis, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=146.16s)]
*  which are in Yemen, again, sponsored by Iran, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=149.94s)]
*  we're launching were actually shot down from Saudi Arabia. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=152.04000000000002s)]
*  That means essentially Saudi was protecting Israel and in Al Arabiya, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=155.36s)]
*  the woman who grilled Michal, the former Hamas leader, uh, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=159.6s)]
*  that Al Arabiya is owned by Saudi the way that Qatar owns Al Al Jazeera. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=163.32s)]
*  So what we're seeing here is that Saudi is very much leading and saying, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=168.44s)]
*  we're not happy with Hamas. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  We're not seeing the protest in Saudi Arabia that you're seeing in the rest of [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=175.0s)]
*  the Arab world. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=178.95999999999998s)]
*  Different country. Come on. Yeah. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=179.79999999999998s)]
*  Let's talk about protests in Saudi Arabia for a minute. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=181.23999999999998s)]
*  That's going to look a lot different than here. It was not fun, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=183.76s)]
*  but that's really interesting that. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=186.35999999999999s)]
*  And that's important to note too, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=187.95999999999998s)]
*  look at where what Saudi Arabia is doing is not happening. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=189.39999999999998s)]
*  Like Qatar, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=194.32s)]
*  where that $6 billion in sanction money that Iran thought it could get its [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=194.79999999999998s)]
*  hands on is frozen temporarily. And Michal, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=197.96s)]
*  the former leader of Hamas that you just mentioned is parked right there at the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=201.68s)]
*  diaspora offices for Hamas because they need good communication. Lisa. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=206.4s)]
*  Well, I just look at this and I think Israel doesn't just have a right to defend [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=211.4s)]
*  itself. It has a right to eliminate and eradicate Hamas and this terrorist [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=215.28s)]
*  threat. I mean, you had 1400 Israelis slaughtered in cold blood on October 7th. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=219.08s)]
*  That's equivalent to 48,000 Americans in a single day, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=223.84s)]
*  16 times what we saw on 9 11. And the response is maddening. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=227.32s)]
*  If you have the Biden administration, slow walking, Israel's ground invasion, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=231.32s)]
*  telling them to aid their enemy when we know that money is going to Hamas, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=235.04s)]
*  they have a $350 million annual military budget. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=238.39999999999998s)]
*  You have people still talking about a two state solution ceasefire. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=242.56s)]
*  When you had Hamas terrorists cut a pregnant woman's stomach open, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=246.95999999999998s)]
*  take the baby out, stab the baby, and then shoot the woman in the head. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=251.12s)]
*  And you're talking about, you know, some sort of a reserved response from Israel. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=254.48000000000002s)]
*  I mean, it is actual insanity. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=259.64s)]
*  Israel has every right to eradicate and destroy Hamas and they should absolutely [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=262.48s)]
*  do that. And if they don't, what do you think the response will be then? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=266.36s)]
*  How do you think Hezbollah will read that? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=269.76s)]
*  How do you think these other terrorist groups will read it? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=271.36s)]
*  How will Iran read it? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=273.36s)]
*  Well, Iran backs all of them, so they'll do exactly what Iran tells them to do. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=275.04s)]
*  Emily. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=279.2s)]
*  You know, Trey mentioned warnings earlier and Israeli leaders are warning [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=280.12s)]
*  that this could be a very long war. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=284.24s)]
*  And I think the undercurrent of everything that you all are saying is the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=285.96000000000004s)]
*  fact that this will last a very long time. Just this weekend, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=290.32s)]
*  we know that proxies launched a drone attack at U.S. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=293.44s)]
*  forces in Syria and thank goodness it essentially crashed without injuries. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=296.84000000000003s)]
*  But I think this is a marathon, not a sprint. And keep in mind that, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=301.76s)]
*  as we know now, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=304.88s)]
*  the U.S. is prepared to support a humanitarian pause in fighting to free [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=305.52s)]
*  hostages. And the Hamas leader said over the weekend, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=309.92s)]
*  he would release hostages if Israel would release Palestinian hostages, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=313.12s)]
*  to which the IDF said, this is psychological terror. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=316.92s)]
*  Nothing is ever on the table. So, you know, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=320.08s)]
*  the massive overlay to me is the patent dishonesty [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=323.0s)]
*  emanating from Hamas and the actual toxicity that sort of plagues [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=327.56s)]
*  this entire situation. So as we analyze, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=332.64s)]
*  there's no truth really to be analyzing other than knowing that the enemy has a [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=335.44s)]
*  language of lies only. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=339.84s)]
*  Moving on to this now, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=342.0s)]
*  anti-Israeli sentiment reaching a terrifying new low yesterday. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=343.8s)]
*  Chilling footage shows an airport in Russia's heavily Muslim Dagestan [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=347.48s)]
*  region being stormed by an angry and hateful mob. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=352.04s)]
*  Some carrying banners with anti-Semitic slogans rushing onto the tarmac and [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=355.84000000000003s)]
*  searching for a flight of Jews and Israelis that landed from Tel Aviv. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=360.84000000000003s)]
*  Horrifying footage. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=371.24s)]
*  A small number of Jews and Israelis were reportedly left isolated by the enraged [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=394.2s)]
*  mob. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=398.96000000000004s)]
*  One group even tried to break into what appears to be a secure staff area of [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=399.4s)]
*  the airport. Now, when they finally got inside, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=403.84s)]
*  you can see a terrified woman in a hijab wave her hands as she tells the angry [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=406.47999999999996s)]
*  mob, there are no Israelis here. And just like that, they moved on. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=411.32s)]
*  What if there was Israelis in there? Outside, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=417.0s)]
*  they continued their search, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=420.47999999999996s)]
*  even trying to flip a security car on the airport tarmac. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=421.59999999999997s)]
*  The Jerusalem post is reporting one rider could be heard saying, quote, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=425.03999999999996s)]
*  we are here for the Jews. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=430.35999999999996s)]
*  We came to kill them with the knives and shoot at them. Morgan, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=432.4s)]
*  it's difficult for me to even say those words, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=436.67999999999995s)]
*  let alone imagine the fear and abject terror of those poor Israelis and Jews [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=438.79999999999995s)]
*  that were in that situation. This is patently unacceptable. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=443.59999999999997s)]
*  Are you okay? It's really hard to be a Jewish parent right now. I'm sorry. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=451.35999999999996s)]
*  I thought about you this week and to Harris when I saw this, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=456.72s)]
*  cause your husband is Jewish and, and you know, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=459.36s)]
*  whenever Hitler was going after the Nazis, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=462.76s)]
*  they didn't care if your kids were half Jewish. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=465.28000000000003s)]
*  And I thought about you as I was thinking about coming down numbered. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=467.52000000000004s)]
*  And I thought they would go after my daughter. They would go after yours. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=470.6s)]
*  It's quickly as they would mine. And it's, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=473.92s)]
*  it's just terrifying to be a Jewish parent right now. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=478.28000000000003s)]
*  You know, wow. I think, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=481.68s)]
*  I think about all those I love from the Jewish faith every day and in my [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=484.32s)]
*  prayers. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=487.88s)]
*  And my biggest prayer is that we don't become anesthetized or blind to what's [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=488.96000000000004s)]
*  hand folding before eyes. We haven't seen the hunting of Jews. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=493.44s)]
*  And if you could translate all of it, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=496.56s)]
*  and I've looked at a transcript here from Dagestan, it's hunting, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=498.24s)]
*  it's catch them. It's what Emily, it's hard to say. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=501.24s)]
*  Emily's so right about what they wanted to do. And they were screaming it, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=504.72s)]
*  proudly screaming it. And I think about that one Arab woman. I mean, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=508.8s)]
*  what, what if there had been Israelis in there? That's a great question. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=513.88s)]
*  But what if there were, and she helped, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=516.84s)]
*  I have all the hope in the world that it's not going to be everybody against the [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=518.64s)]
*  Jews again. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=522.76s)]
*  Well, I know that's, you know, it's funny. I know this time very clearly, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=523.64s)]
*  who would hide us and who would watch us go by, you know, like Doug, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=527.72s)]
*  I'm a reservist. So I, I apologize. Everybody had been up for like four or five [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=531.84s)]
*  days a row at 5 a.m. So I'm a little tired, but you know, Doug, I, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=536.4s)]
*  I just, and you're such a, you know, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=540.8399999999999s)]
*  a person of faith and appreciate what you do in the reserves as well. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=542.56s)]
*  The one thing I thought through all of this is I'm going to teach her to fight. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=546.64s)]
*  You know, I'm wearing my star of David. I'm not taking it off. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=550.64s)]
*  I'm not going to hide. And that's what I'm going to teach my daughter. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=554.56s)]
*  And as much as I look at these college campuses and I look right here in New [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=558.28s)]
*  York City, that, you know, kids, not much older than her, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=561.3199999999999s)]
*  had to barricade themselves in a library, had to be escorted out of the back. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=565.24s)]
*  This is happening in America. And I said this to a friend over the weekend. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=568.84s)]
*  It is, we are not protected. We are not immune from this in America. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=572.24s)]
*  You know, we often at our temple and I'm sure at many churches, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=577.16s)]
*  we have had security for a long time. We've had to up our security. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=580.48s)]
*  We've had to cancel some events, but the only thing I can tell to, you know, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=584.5600000000001s)]
*  to everybody watching is this is why, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=588.92s)]
*  and Lisa just said it so eloquently in the last segment. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=591.5600000000001s)]
*  This is why we have to fight them. This is why, you know, I just, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=594.28s)]
*  I refuse not to wear Jewish symbols. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=597.76s)]
*  I refuse to try and hide our identity and who we are. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=600.04s)]
*  I will not do that in America and around the world, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=603.68s)]
*  Jews are being forced to do that. And so thank you for what you said, Lisa. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=606.88s)]
*  And this is why Israel has to exist. I mean, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=610.7199999999999s)]
*  this is why we have to protect Israel. I mean, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=613.56s)]
*  look at what these people want to do to Jews around the world. I mean, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=615.9599999999999s)]
*  they said we are here for the Jews. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=619.8399999999999s)]
*  We came to kill them with knives and to shoot them. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=621.8s)]
*  The people out supporting this, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=624.6s)]
*  even in the streets of America and in Congress, the Hamas Congress, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=625.92s)]
*  they support terrorism. They just support the destruction and the death of Jews. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=629.28s)]
*  That's what we have. We have to be honest about this conversation. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=633.28s)]
*  Instead you have some in the media pushing Hamas propaganda from the Gaza [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=635.8s)]
*  health ministry, which is Hamas, right? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=640.3199999999999s)]
*  Or even defending the Palestinians. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=642.4s)]
*  When you look at even 2021 where majority of Palestinians supported Hamas, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=644.52s)]
*  that is their government. Okay. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=648.72s)]
*  So I think part of what is healthy in this and part of what we have to do in [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=650.64s)]
*  the media, particularly just be honest about all of this, right? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=655.1999999999999s)]
*  To tell the truth, to call out what is evil and this is evil. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=657.92s)]
*  What is happening in America? And we can't blanket over. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=661.72s)]
*  We can't talk about the plight of what's happening in Gaza. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=664.3199999999999s)]
*  We talk about the plight of 1400 Israelis that were murdered in cold blood [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=667.04s)]
*  equivalent to 48,000 Americans here. It's madness. It's disgusting. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=671.0s)]
*  It's evil. We're in a battle of good versus evil right now. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=675.88s)]
*  If you're equivocating right now, and we've talked about this in our country, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=679.32s)]
*  if it's in Chicago, you've been to Jewish groups a lot and have to go through [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=682.7600000000001s)]
*  security, but we talk about never forget. Bull. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=685.4000000000001s)]
*  We've got a whole group of Americans right now that are forgetting. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=689.0400000000001s)]
*  They're forgetting why Israel exists. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=691.84s)]
*  They're forgetting what happened to Jewish people and they're seeing it right here. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=693.24s)]
*  This is not a movie. What happened up the street in this, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=696.32s)]
*  in this library was not a depiction. It was real. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=698.88s)]
*  And here's the part that bothers me the most right now. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=702.0s)]
*  And in these thugs of Hamas period thugs of Hamas who draped, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=704.0s)]
*  fillaged and plundered Palestinian people different. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=708.0400000000001s)]
*  The thugs that are running this need to understand that all they understand is [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=710.32s)]
*  force. So for us to have multiple attacks on our basis, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=714.2s)]
*  and we respond by hitting a warehouse, Biden, it's time to step it up. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=718.2800000000001s)]
*  It's time to be more than just tall. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=721.6800000000001s)]
*  It's time to make sure that this is not good on all over the world. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=723.2s)]
*  You know, as we discuss this, I think about, as everyone is watching, you know, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=727.6800000000001s)]
*  the question is, what can everyone do? Call your congressperson, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=731.12s)]
*  let them know in stark contrast to representative Jayapal, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=735.4s)]
*  which said the president doesn't represent many of Americans. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=738.68s)]
*  You call them and tell them what you want them to and how you want them to [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=742.08s)]
*  represent. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=745.4399999999999s)]
*  It is an abomination that the only countries that stood with the U S at the UN [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=746.12s)]
*  in condemning these attacks were Austria, the Czechoslovakia, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=750.68s)]
*  and the Czech Republic and Croatia. And Croatia said, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=755.16s)]
*  it was a Croatia or the Czech Republic that said we should leave the UN because [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=759.88s)]
*  this is absolutely unacceptable that the UN is simply wanting to support a [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=763.04s)]
*  ceasefire and not condemning it for these hateful attacks that they are. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=767.28s)]
*  Because when we stand quiet, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=770.72s)]
*  when we don't stand vocally in solidarity with the Jewish people who represent [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=772.4s)]
*  our own, then this is what will happen. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=776.6s)]
*  That someday we'll be left with the world saying, never forget, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=779.56s)]
*  instead of saying, no, it stops right now. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=782.12s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. You know what? I would just add this. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=784.6s)]
*  It will be the Jews today and it will be the rest of us tomorrow. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=788.12s)]
*  And we know that because when Mashal, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=791.6800000000001s)]
*  the former leader of Hamas put out that all call three weeks, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=793.9200000000001s)]
*  three Fridays ago and said, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=797.2800000000001s)]
*  get in the streets and protests and anything you can do on your own. Well, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=799.12s)]
*  we know what he meant. That was for Jews. That was for Christians. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=802.72s)]
*  And that was for something called soft Arabs. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=806.96s)]
*  I suppose those would be the ones who might help others or not shoot others. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=809.4000000000001s)]
*  We are all in play here. And as Emily says, we cannot remain silent. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=814.2s)]
*  And I won't. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpiVT9XTNE&t=818.44s)]
