# Israeli Rep. to the UN: We see no other choice but to enter Rafah
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [March 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY)
*  With us right now is the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=0.0s)]
*  Ambassador, very good to have you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=4.68s)]
*  There's no doubt there's pressure on your country, sir. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=7.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=8.76s)]
*  Thank you for having me, Neil. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=9.76s)]
*  I apologize. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=10.76s)]
*  Sir, no doubt a lot of pressure on your country. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=11.76s)]
*  What do you think about it? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  How do you feel about it? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  Look, I still believe that the relations between Israel and the United States are unbreakable. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=17.6s)]
*  And as the president used to call them, ironclad, we do not hide that we have some disagreements [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=27.04s)]
*  on how to conduct the war in Gaza. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=34.56s)]
*  But still, we feel that the administration and, first and foremost, the president, is [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=38.2s)]
*  committed to the most important objective of this war, which is the full eradication [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=44.8s)]
*  Hamas' terror capabilities, because we all understand that if Hamas stays in power, there [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=52.96s)]
*  is no future not only for Israelis but also not for the Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=58.32s)]
*  As you know, the goal might be the same, Ambassador. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=64.24000000000001s)]
*  The way you go about it is very different. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=68.0s)]
*  The administration dead set against what Benjamin Netanyahu and your government want to do by [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=69.64s)]
*  extending this war into Ra'apah. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=73.04s)]
*  They say, and this is quoting from Bennett Patel, the U.S. State Department deputy spokesperson, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  and I quote here, we believe that Hamas can be defeated, but it must be done in a targeted [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=79.83999999999999s)]
*  and more precise manner. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=84.32s)]
*  And hopefully it does not impact or have any negative impact on Palestinian civilians. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=85.8s)]
*  They go on to say that an attack on Ra'apah will make that much worse and blow it way [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  out of proportion. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=96.82s)]
*  You say? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=97.82s)]
*  Look, we share the concern to mitigate the civilian casualties in Gaza. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=99.82s)]
*  But one has to remember, we didn't want this war. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=109.04s)]
*  We did not initiate this war. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=112.12s)]
*  We were attacked on October 7th. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=115.06s)]
*  We were massacred. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=117.4s)]
*  There is no one who wants to avoid a military operation in Ra'apah more than Israel. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=118.84s)]
*  It's our children, our soldiers, who are paying the ultimate price if they enter Ra'apah. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=124.92s)]
*  But we are left with no other choice. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=131.72s)]
*  There are still four Hamas battalions in Gaza. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=133.48000000000002s)]
*  If we do not eradicate them, so Hamas will definitely rearm, regroup, take over again [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=138.35999999999999s)]
*  Gaza, and they will attack us again and again, as they promised to do. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=145.44s)]
*  So we are always open to listen to our closest ally, the United States of America. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=150.26s)]
*  That is why we are sending a high-level delegation to D.C., as you reported. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=154.88s)]
*  And yeah, we hope to see whether there are other tactics or strategy that we can implement [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  that would help us to avoid a military operation in Ra'apah. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=167.76s)]
*  Right now, we see no other choice but to enter Ra'apah to eradicate Hamas' terror capabilities. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=171.92s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu had a video conference call with Republican senators, and apparently [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=178.8s)]
*  he wanted to do the same with Democratic senators, but Chuck Schumer declined. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=185.68s)]
*  Chuck Schumer, of course, the same Senate leader who was calling for new elections in Israel. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=191.0s)]
*  What are your relations with Chuck Schumer? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=198.12s)]
*  Well, I thought they were fine, and we appreciate the fact that for many years he supported [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=204.12s)]
*  Israel and he's a friend of Israel. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=211.64s)]
*  But honestly, as I said, I was—before I became a diplomat, I was also a senior politician [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=214.64s)]
*  in Israel. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=221.24s)]
*  You don't do the things that—you don't say these things that Senator Schumer said. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=222.76s)]
*  It was a shameful speech. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=228.76s)]
*  You don't intervene into your closest ally political arena. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=231.92s)]
*  You definitely don't do it in a time of war. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=236.44s)]
*  And to call for an early election and the replacement of an elected prime minister at [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=240.4s)]
*  a time of war, it is shameful. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=246.0s)]
*  In the meantime, though, getting ready for this ceasefire resolution that was called [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=249.12s)]
*  on by the United States on the part of you and Hamas that would have a six-week pause [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=254.16s)]
*  in hostilities to work out hostage release. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=259.4s)]
*  But that's the United States leading this effort. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=262.56s)]
*  I believe, sir, it's the first time in this war. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=264.96s)]
*  Does that worry you? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=267.88s)]
*  Do you worry about the pendulum swinging against you when it comes to this country and support [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=268.88s)]
*  for you? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=272.96s)]
*  Look, I'm in close contact with Ambassador Thomas Greenfield with regards to the draft [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=273.96s)]
*  resolution that was submitted by the United States. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=282.2s)]
*  I was just updated before this interview that it will be voted upon tomorrow morning here [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=285.88s)]
*  in the United Nations at the Security Council. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=291.67999999999995s)]
*  I won't say that we like all aspects and all clauses that are included in the draft [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=295.59999999999997s)]
*  resolution, but we can live with this resolution because it still condemns Hamas, which is [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=302.0s)]
*  something that still did not happen here in any other U.N. body, and it still ties, it [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=311.68s)]
*  makes the connection between a hostage release deal and an immediate ceasefire. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=317.91999999999996s)]
*  It doesn't call for an unconditional and immediate ceasefire without the release of [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=325.92s)]
*  the hostages. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=334.04s)]
*  So, yeah, we don't like the United States involving the U.N. The U.N. is a terrible [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  place in our military operation, but still this is a draft that we can live with. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=341.56s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=349.36s)]
*  Ambassador, thank you very much. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=350.28000000000003s)]
*  I know these are tenuous times. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=351.56s)]
*  Be well, be safe. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=353.04s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rqny2XoclY&t=354.44s)]
