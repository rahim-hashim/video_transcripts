# Former FBI assistant director warns US facing greatest terrorist threat since run up to 9/11
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ)
*  In just the past few weeks, multiple foreign terrorist organizations have called for attacks [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=0.0s)]
*  against Americans and the West. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=8.96s)]
*  The FBI Director Ray, nor the president, have any idea whether or not there is somebody [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=11.8s)]
*  from Hamas roaming around the United States of America who could strike this kind of deadly [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=17.52s)]
*  attack on our own country. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=22.76s)]
*  Alright, you notice a pattern here. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=25.8s)]
*  More and more governors, in fact the governors of Oklahoma and Texas, who were visiting [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=27.52s)]
*  Israel to warn us what's going on over there and the threat of terror over there is in [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=32.08s)]
*  fact likely to happen over here. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=35.88s)]
*  Christopher Ray, the FBI Director, saying as much just a few days earlier. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=37.56s)]
*  Chris Wecker is the former FBI Assistant Director. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=40.72s)]
*  Chris, good to have you. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  Are they right? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=44.92s)]
*  Is it just a matter of time before we're dealing with what Israel's dealing with here? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=45.92s)]
*  Absolutely, Neil. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=51.2s)]
*  I mean, this is the greatest terrorist threat to this country since the pre-9-11 run-up. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=53.4s)]
*  And I think it's even more pronounced now because we have these conflicts. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=59.6s)]
*  These cells in the United States, I mean, when I say cells, I mean Hezbollah and Hamas, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=64.6s)]
*  but mostly Hezbollah have been around for a long, long time raising money, committing [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=69.0s)]
*  crimes and raising money for Hezbollah. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=73.6s)]
*  Those cells could quickly morph into violent cells and with the southern border being as [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=76.0s)]
*  open as it is, we have no idea who's in this country. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=82.0s)]
*  So it's a combination of what's going on in the Middle East as well as that wide open [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=85.8s)]
*  southern border. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=90.8s)]
*  We got to have a couple hundred FBI agents on that border trying to determine who's coming [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=91.8s)]
*  in. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=96.6s)]
*  We have completely negated all the security steps that we took after 9-11 to keep terrorists [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=97.6s)]
*  out of this country. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=102.6s)]
*  So the fear is they're already here, Chris. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=103.6s)]
*  And then the question becomes the added inspiration of this Hamas activity against Israel started [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=106.6s)]
*  four weeks ago this very day. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=114.0s)]
*  And I'm just wondering, because that's how Christopher Ray framed it, that they would [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=116.19999999999999s)]
*  take inspiration from that and follow up on that. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=120.0s)]
*  In what way? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=123.39999999999999s)]
*  Clearly, I mean, we've seen this over the years where a lone terrorist hears the call, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=125.6s)]
*  They operate semi-independently in the sense that they're not card-carrying Hezbollah or [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=132.0s)]
*  card-carrying Hamas or Al-Qaeda or ISIS. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=137.0s)]
*  But then there's also the greater threat, I think, of organized terrorist activity in [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=139.9s)]
*  the U.S. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=144.4s)]
*  Yes, these cells were already here, but there's even more flowing across our border every [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=145.4s)]
*  day without question. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=150.1s)]
*  And we don't know where they are or who they are. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=152.5s)]
*  If you're a terrorist, you're going to sneak across that southern border. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=156.74s)]
*  You don't need to take a plane or use any other means to get into this country. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=159.88s)]
*  And they can come in in groups and cells. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=164.01999999999998s)]
*  They often get mistaken for being Hispanic if they actually do go through a border crossing. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=166.35999999999999s)]
*  But most of them don't. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=171.64s)]
*  They go around the border crossings and come in illegally with the help of the cartels, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=172.68s)]
*  which is another scary alliance. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=176.72s)]
*  We're waiting in the meantime, Chris, before Antony Blinken, our Secretary of State, is [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  meeting with a number of our leaders, his counterparts, foreign ministers from the likes [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=183.07999999999998s)]
*  of Jordan and Egypt, Saudi Arabia, what have you. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=187.28s)]
*  When it comes to those representatives with whom he's chatting, to a man, they seem to [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=191.56s)]
*  be saying, go slow, Israel, cool it on what you're doing at the border. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=195.96s)]
*  Yet we discover that Hamas-wounded fighters are sneaking in on these ambulances and getting [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=201.48000000000002s)]
*  out of the country. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=205.88s)]
*  So many of them might have already left the country. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=207.68s)]
*  Then it begs the question, to do what? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=211.16000000000003s)]
*  To do bad things. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=216.04s)]
*  I mean, I was the FBI's on-seat commander in Iraq, and we were investigating bombings [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=217.04s)]
*  throughout the theater, targeting civilians primarily. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=221.92s)]
*  And the hand of Iran was all over these bombings. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=225.28s)]
*  And when you see 500 pounds of high explosives and what that can do, it wakes you up to the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=230.35999999999999s)]
*  level of commitment, because that suicide bomber is planning on going out himself as [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=236.23999999999998s)]
*  well. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=240.07999999999998s)]
*  I saw him bomb a Red Cross and other facilities, the UN. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=241.07999999999998s)]
*  There are no boundaries for these people, and they are dedicated to destroying the Western [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=244.92s)]
*  civilization as we know it. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=249.32s)]
*  So they're in it for the long haul. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=251.23999999999998s)]
*  And I guess the point being, Neil, you can't trust them. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=253.95999999999998s)]
*  No matter what they say, you cannot trust them. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=257.36s)]
*  In the meantime, we have this policy of going after and beefing up our troop presence, I [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=260.12s)]
*  believe mostly in Syria. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=264.52s)]
*  I think we're up to 1,200 troops, if memory serves me right, Chris. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=265.52s)]
*  And it's meant to attack these Iranian-funded proxies that have been behind 28, 29 attacks [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=268.90000000000003s)]
*  over the last couple of weeks. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=275.18s)]
*  But as I mentioned with a couple of other guests, Chris, never Iran itself. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=276.78000000000003s)]
*  And the fear is obviously, you go after Iran itself, the war has expanded dramatically. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=279.94s)]
*  But Iran's already doing that, and Iran is already anticipating our reticence to expand. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=286.90000000000003s)]
*  So they keep doing that. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=293.92s)]
*  So what's the answer? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=295.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's my belief that Iran already has nuclear capabilities, and they've been [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=296.28s)]
*  lying to us all along. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=303.44s)]
*  So we're dealing with a nuclear power here. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=305.55999999999995s)]
*  So I can understand why we're going to hit the proxies, why we're going to nibble around [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=308.15999999999997s)]
*  the edges, but I don't think that Iran understands that. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=311.15999999999997s)]
*  When Trump hit Soleimani, that sent the right message. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=314.71999999999997s)]
*  And I think we need to take those types of measures that are dramatic, not just, as I [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=318.4s)]
*  said, nibbling around the edges. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=323.64s)]
*  But we need to send a clear message. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=325.16s)]
*  We don't have to evade Iran. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=327.16s)]
*  We don't have to do what we did in Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=328.16s)]
*  But we need to hit some really high-value targets, even if they are in Iran, because [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=330.8s)]
*  they know they don't have the capability to go up against the United States. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=334.96s)]
*  We still are the world's greatest military power. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=338.44s)]
*  But we have to send a clear, dramatic message, much like the Soleimani hit. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=343.02s)]
*  Chris, thank you very much. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=347.84000000000003s)]
*  Chris Wecker, the former FBI Assistant Director. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=349.64s)]
*  He's been in harm's way all his life, dealing with this and seeing it firsthand. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TiBoXUDMpQ&t=352.6s)]
