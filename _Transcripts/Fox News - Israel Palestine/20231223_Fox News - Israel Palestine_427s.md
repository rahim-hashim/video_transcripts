# ‘EARTH MOVING’: Former Israeli PM says Oct 7 changed their society ‘forever’
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ)
*  Jackie and Greg, for more on this, let's bring in former Israeli prime minister and currently [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=0.0s)]
*  the leader of the opposition in the Israeli Knesset, Yair Lapid. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=5.0s)]
*  Mr. Lapid, thank you for being here as we go into, I believe, what is day 78 of the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=8.96s)]
*  war. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=15.16s)]
*  I want to get your reaction to what transpired here this week in what appears to be a watered-down [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=16.16s)]
*  resolution from the UN. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=22.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=24.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=25.36s)]
*  Well, you know what? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=26.36s)]
*  If they're going to have resolutions in the UN, why don't they start with imposing the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=27.36s)]
*  ones before? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=31.520000000000003s)]
*  We've been talking with the UN forever and ever now about Resolution 1701 in the northern [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=33.36s)]
*  border, in Lebanon. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  This has been there for a decade now. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=40.68s)]
*  Nobody is complying to this resolution. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=43.36s)]
*  So if they just want to talk to themselves, it's fine by us. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  But if they're taking resolutions seriously, they should start by making sure that they're [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=49.64s)]
*  imposing the resolutions they had before. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=54.559999999999995s)]
*  Yair, has the UN gone far enough in condemning Hamas? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=57.28s)]
*  It doesn't appear their language was really quite forceful about what happened on October [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=62.48s)]
*  7th. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=68.28s)]
*  This is, you know what, it's amazing to me. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=69.92s)]
*  You know, they had, the Security Council was gathered because the UN Secretary General [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=72.44s)]
*  Guterres used what they call Article 99, which is a very, very rare article he can use in [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=81.44s)]
*  order to have the Security Council gathering. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=86.92s)]
*  Now, they didn't use it in Syria, half a million people killed. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=89.96000000000001s)]
*  They didn't use it in Congo, four million people killed. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=93.92s)]
*  They didn't use it in Darfur, half a million people killed. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=96.64s)]
*  They're using it when the Jews are being attacked and killed, and they're using it against the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=100.4s)]
*  Jews and against Israel. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=105.28s)]
*  So it is amazing to me that the United Nations is acting the way they are. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=106.68s)]
*  Let's talk about what's happening in Israel now. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=112.2s)]
*  There are signs that Israel's economy is having struggles now with so many Israelis called [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=114.84s)]
*  up for reserve duty, with Palestinians not being a part of the full workforce coming [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=121.08s)]
*  out of places like the West Bank. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=127.76s)]
*  What is your assessment of the war's impact on Israel right now? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=129.32s)]
*  Well, let's tell our enemies not to hold their hopes too high. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=135.12s)]
*  The Israeli economy is strong, the Israeli society is strong. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=140.84s)]
*  Even the differences we do have are due to the fact that we are a vital and vibrant democracy, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=144.68s)]
*  and our economy is a very advanced economy, very high-tech economy, and it can endure [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=149.76s)]
*  whatever it takes in order for us to win this war and especially to bring back the hostages. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  This is, you know, when a society like Israel is totally focused on achieving a goal, we [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=161.7s)]
*  will prevail. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=168.57999999999998s)]
*  Let's talk about leadership. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=170.85999999999999s)]
*  From the early days, you were not wanting to put any daylight between yourself and Prime [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=172.61999999999998s)]
*  Minister Netanyahu, but now it appears, at least from your social media, that it may [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=177.54s)]
*  be time for someone else to lead Israel. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=183.54s)]
*  What is your thought? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=187.38s)]
*  Well, there is a reason, of course, why I've decided to stay in the opposition and not [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=189.5s)]
*  to join the Netanyahu government, and I have my thoughts about the kind of leadership we [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=194.34s)]
*  need these days. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=198.66s)]
*  But if you'll excuse me, Griff, I feel a bit uncomfortable discussing this in international [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=199.66s)]
*  media while the country is at war. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=204.74s)]
*  On the war, you're right, there is no daylight. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=207.29999999999998s)]
*  Two goals, the total eradication of Hamas and bringing back the hostages back to their [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=209.78s)]
*  homes and to their families. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=216.7s)]
*  And, Yair, I can completely understand wanting to, you know, not in the international media [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=218.29999999999998s)]
*  talk about it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=224.22s)]
*  I guess kind of where I was going with that question is, you know, we've heard talk about [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=225.22s)]
*  when will there be the next election in Israel. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=229.22s)]
*  Is it time? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=232.73999999999998s)]
*  Are we nearing the time for a new election or not? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=233.73999999999998s)]
*  Well, I would say 2024 is an election year, not only in the United States but also in [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=237.1s)]
*  Israel. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=242.29999999999998s)]
*  I think what has happened to us on October the 7th is earth moving and has changed the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=243.3s)]
*  Israeli society forever, and there will be, as a consequence, a political result to it. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=249.74s)]
*  So yes, I think we're going to an election. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=256.78000000000003s)]
*  You know what? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=259.1s)]
*  It's part of being a democracy. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=260.1s)]
*  Democracies can have an election even during wartime. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=261.1s)]
*  The United States has been through election even during World War II, which is the greatest [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=265.7s)]
*  world in the history of humankind. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=270.66s)]
*  And, Yair, I just want to get, in the time we have remaining, your sense of how the families [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=272.58s)]
*  are doing. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=278.78000000000003s)]
*  The hostages are still being held. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=279.78000000000003s)]
*  The families of the victims that were killed. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=282.1s)]
*  How is the spirit of Israel and how are those families doing? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=285.14s)]
*  You know, it's heartbreaking. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=288.34000000000003s)]
*  I'm sitting with the families on a daily basis discussing this with them. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=290.54s)]
*  Just imagine, I don't know, Griff, do you have children? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=294.94s)]
*  I do. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=297.82s)]
*  Two daughters. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=298.82s)]
*  So just imagine one day somebody's breaking into your house, taking your two daughters, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=300.02s)]
*  and they disappear for 80 days. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=306.06s)]
*  And you don't know if they're alive or dead or since his daughter's even, I don't want [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=308.21999999999997s)]
*  to go into there, but where things can happen. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=312.18s)]
*  So this is what is happening to the families. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=315.58s)]
*  It's devastating beyond belief. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=319.1s)]
*  And the entire country is in a constant, it's just sorrow. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=321.96s)]
*  There's sadness in the air. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=327.90000000000003s)]
*  We're at the beginning, there's a new year coming and everybody's just sad. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=330.74s)]
*  Sad and devastated and trying to figure out what kind of people are doing this. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=336.06s)]
*  Taking children from their homes and holding them hostages in a religious war. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=341.06s)]
*  And should you be part of an election cycle forthcoming, what will be your message to [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=347.02000000000004s)]
*  the Israeli people, those that have been so sad, that are now making such great sacrifices [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=352.42s)]
*  as you try and get to some sort of end goal with situation in Gaza? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=357.82s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=364.82s)]
*  Well, I say the answer is we have been in tough spots before, even tougher than this. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=366.18s)]
*  My grandfather died in the Mauthausen concentration camp and my father was a child in the Budapest [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=372.42s)]
*  ghetto. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=378.22s)]
*  We've been to places no other nation has been to and we always prevailed and we always found [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=379.22s)]
*  the strength within ourselves to rebuild and to rejoice and to become something new [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=385.26s)]
*  and even better than before. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=391.26s)]
*  So even this tough spot we're in is going to become the opening or the starting point [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=393.34s)]
*  for something greater and better. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=399.82s)]
*  Israel is going to be fine. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=402.09999999999997s)]
*  That is the spirit of resolve in one we have seen time and again from Israel, Yair Lapid. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=405.06s)]
*  Thank you for taking time and joining us. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=410.98s)]
*  Happy holidays to you. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=412.74s)]
*  Happy holidays, happy new year. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=414.78s)]
*  Thank you, Griff. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5wsH8XMUrQ&t=416.21999999999997s)]
