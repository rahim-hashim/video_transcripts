# Rocket alerts go off in Southern Israel
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8)
*  result. Trey Yengst has the breaking news live from Tel Aviv. Trey. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, hey, we're following some really developing stories right now. We can see air defense coming [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  off of some areas near to Tel Aviv flying through the sky. And when I look at the, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=12.48s)]
*  and I'm just going to just stay with me here, I'm going to look at where these red alerts are [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=20.0s)]
*  on right now. There are sirens sounding right now in communities across Israel. We just saw another, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=23.84s)]
*  some sort of missile interceptor fired off from an area around Tel Aviv. It is unclear what, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=32.24s)]
*  whether this is David's sling or the Aero system, it is not the Iron Dome from this location. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=39.44s)]
*  And I'm just going to step out of the frame here and see if we can, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  you can see any of these interceptors go off here, but let's just talk about what's happening. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=49.92s)]
*  There's a lot of red alerts right now that are, and reports of explosions heard near Be'er Sheva. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=53.68s)]
*  Okay. And right now you can see an interceptor coming off. I'm not sure if our cameras are able [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=63.28s)]
*  to pick that up, but that right there is the missile defense that is currently being used [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=67.76s)]
*  across Israel. We're going to try to get more information on what exactly is being [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=74.88s)]
*  fired here, but this is a clear indication that some of these Iranian drones or missiles have [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=81.52s)]
*  made it into Israeli airspace. The local channels right now that I can see are airing footage from [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=88.96s)]
*  inside Israel of interceptions taking place. They're also on the right side of Israeli channels [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=96.0s)]
*  in Hebrew. They have a list of the cities where sirens are currently sounding. And so again, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=103.68s)]
*  this is a really unprecedented situation and I just want to confirm some information here [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=110.0s)]
*  before I report it to air. So just stay with me. And there are sirens that are currently sounding [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=114.64000000000001s)]
*  in Jerusalem and Demona. That is where the nuclear facility is for the Israelis. So again, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=120.4s)]
*  a lot of developments right now. This is the initial Iranian response to the strike earlier [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=127.84s)]
*  this month that targeted seven members of Iran's IRGC in Syria at the Iranian consulate. But again, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  this attack is starting to reach Israeli territory. There are Israeli defense officials still meeting [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=142.32s)]
*  at the Kerea, Israel's version of the Pentagon, just a few miles from here, determining what the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=148.4s)]
*  Israeli response against Iran will be. John? All right. So very, very quickly, Trey, you talked [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=153.6s)]
*  about the Aero system and David's sling. Those are designed to intercept missiles or projectiles [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  that are coming in from varying altitudes. Do I have that right? Yes, absolutely. So Israel has [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  a tiered air defense system. The lowest tier is the Iron Dome, a system that was used over the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=178.32s)]
*  past 190 days during the war between Israel and Tamas. This is a short range system. It was [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=184.95999999999998s)]
*  developed in 2011 and it is used to shoot down rockets from places like Gaza and Lebanon. Then [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=191.44s)]
*  the system above the Iron Dome is called David's sling. This is a system that is able to intercept [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=199.12s)]
*  medium and in some cases long range missiles that are targeting Israel. And then finally, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=205.04000000000002s)]
*  you have the Aero 2 and the Aero 3 systems. These are Israel's most advanced missile defense systems. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=210.88s)]
*  They are used to shoot down ballistic missiles, Shahab missiles that could be fired by the Iranians. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=217.04000000000002s)]
*  These are likely the missiles that would be used if they take it to the ballistic category. But again, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=222.64000000000001s)]
*  I want to be very careful with what we're reporting here in terms of the missiles that are being used. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=227.60000000000002s)]
*  There is a major difference between cruise missiles and ballistic missiles. And so far, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=233.04s)]
*  I have not been able to independently confirm that any ballistic missiles have been used by [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=237.6s)]
*  the Iranians. We have been able to confirm that a wave of attack drones was launched from Iranian [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=241.76s)]
*  territory toward Israel. There were also indications that the Americans shot down at least one of the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=246.64s)]
*  drones that was trying to target Israel. And there are also reports that cruise missiles were used in [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=253.92s)]
*  this attack. But again, and I just want to read a little bit here as we're talking, John, because [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=260.24s)]
*  there are reports still at this moment of sirens sounding across Israel. And again, we could see [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=265.76s)]
*  some of this missile defense active from Tel Aviv. There were interceptor rounds that were coming off [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=273.12s)]
*  of the skyline, soaring through the air and headed toward the projectiles entering Israeli airspace. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=280.64s)]
*  But the amount of sirens that are sounding across Israel indicate this was not an Iranian attack that [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=289.52s)]
*  was focused simply on military installations. And I also should note here, remember, and we just [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=296.56s)]
*  covered this, John, Israel's Home Front Command only told people in the southernmost and northernmost [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=302.64s)]
*  parts of this country to be close to bomb shelters. There were sirens sounding in Israel's largest [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=308.96s)]
*  city of Jerusalem. There were also sirens sounding in Demona. This is close to Israel's [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=316.16s)]
*  nuclear facilities. Parts of the West Bank had sirens. Be'er Sheva, Israel's third largest city. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=322.16s)]
*  And these are still alerts that are coming in at this hour. Israeli channels as we speak, John, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=329.20000000000005s)]
*  are airing videos from different parts of this country where you see air defense systems that [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=334.64000000000004s)]
*  are active. And excuse me for looking down here. I just want to keep you updated on the information [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=340.0s)]
*  that we are getting in. Iran says at this hour that they've concluded their attack. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=344.64s)]
*  The Israelis will certainly not see it that way. Israel is still facing fire at this moment. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=349.91999999999996s)]
*  These alerts are coming in onto my phone as we speak. Red Alerts, this is the system used to [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=355.91999999999996s)]
*  inform Israeli civilians of rocket and drone attacks. And they are still sounding at this hour. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=361.91999999999996s)]
*  So we're talking about hundreds of thousands and actually really more at this moment [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=369.44s)]
*  headed to bomb shelters in Israel as a result of this Iranian attack. It is ongoing at this moment [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=375.12s)]
*  and sirens continue to sound across this country as Israel's air defense systems are trying to [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=382.32s)]
*  engage these targets launched from Iran as part of this Iranian response to the killing of a top [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=388.0s)]
*  Iranian general earlier this month in Damascus, Syria. John? It is about 10 minutes till two in [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=394.56s)]
*  the morning in Tel Aviv where Trey is working. Trey, you're doing a great job. We thank you for [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRljJtuobr8&t=401.6s)]
