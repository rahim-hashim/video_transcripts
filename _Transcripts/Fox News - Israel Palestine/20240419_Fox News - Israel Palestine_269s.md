# US embassy issues warning, takes action after Israel's attack on Iran
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI)
*  The U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem is telling employees and their families to exercise caution after [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel carried out a strike on Iran and restricted personal travel outside the Greater Tel Aviv, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=6.0s)]
*  Jerusalem and Beersheba areas until further notice. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=11.76s)]
*  Rabbi Aryeh Lightstone served as the senior adviser to Donald Trump's ambassador to Israel [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=15.32s)]
*  and is live near Tel Aviv right now. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=20.64s)]
*  Rabbi, good morning to you. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=22.6s)]
*  What is the mood like in Jerusalem or in Israel right now following the strike last night? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=24.16s)]
*  The mood, I think, is actually quietly confident. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=29.92s)]
*  There are two different things that give you a sign in Israel in terms of how things are [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=34.24s)]
*  going. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=38.040000000000006s)]
*  Number one is the amount of leaks that come from the government, which traditionally leaks [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=39.040000000000006s)]
*  like a sieve. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=42.52s)]
*  And the other is whether the schools are in session or not. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=43.96s)]
*  And for the last eight hours, the government has not leaked anything, and the schools are [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=46.68000000000001s)]
*  in session. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=51.2s)]
*  So when both of those things happen, the Israeli people are rather satisfied that their government [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=52.2s)]
*  is going about their business as they should be. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=55.86s)]
*  Speaking of leaks, Rabbi, the news that we have been getting through reports, possibly [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  through Israel itself, is that this strike wasn't going to happen for some time after [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=63.879999999999995s)]
*  Passover or even after Israel launched its ground invasion into Ra'afa, but it took [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=68.75999999999999s)]
*  place last night. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=74.94s)]
*  Do you think that was by design by Israel to sort of muddy the waters in terms of their [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=76.25999999999999s)]
*  timeline for the strike? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=81.69999999999999s)]
*  And if so, why? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=83.08s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=85.08s)]
*  I think most of the time that you have reporters declaratively tell you something that they've [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=86.48s)]
*  heard from the Israeli Security Cabinet, it's because the Israeli Security Cabinet wants [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=90.52s)]
*  you to think that way. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=94.52s)]
*  And so therefore, thinking that the attack would happen after Passover, perhaps delayed [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=95.92s)]
*  until after the Gaza war was completed, was a faint in order to have Iran sort of relax [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=100.8s)]
*  a little bit. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=107.56s)]
*  The ultimate success over here is that Israel was able to demonstrate to the Iranian leadership [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=108.56s)]
*  that they can hit anywhere at any point in time in Iran, and they won't see it coming. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=115.56s)]
*  Are you worried, Rabbi, that there's going to be a retaliatory strike by Iran in Israel? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=121.0s)]
*  No, today I'm not, mostly because Israel allowed Iran a way to back out of this. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=126.28s)]
*  Iran is publicly declaring to their people that there was no strike. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=132.28s)]
*  They even have news trucks driving around the city of Ishafan showing, see, no explosions [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=135.52s)]
*  over here, and therefore setting up a situation where they can claim that there was an attempt [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=140.28s)]
*  by Israel, it was not done by Iranian air defenses, and everything can sort of reset. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=145.26s)]
*  Iran does not want a full-scale war against Israel. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=149.94s)]
*  And when they saw Israel, together with its allies, chief amongst them, the United States [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=153.74s)]
*  of America, standing up against their attack, my guess is that Iran will attack a soft target [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=158.1s)]
*  in the next, I don't know, four to six weeks, an embassy perhaps in South America, or some [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=163.34s)]
*  Jewish gathering somewhere in Western Europe. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=168.76s)]
*  So Rabbi, there is big news out of The Wall Street Journal. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=171.78s)]
*  They reported yesterday that the White House is renewing their push for Israel to normalize [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=174.14s)]
*  relations with Saudi Arabia. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=179.1s)]
*  But in order for that to happen, Israel is going to have to agree to Palestinian statehood. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=181.18s)]
*  Two-part question here. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=187.18s)]
*  What does Palestinian statehood actually mean? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=188.7s)]
*  And also, what do you think about this possible deal overall, normalization of relations with [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=192.26s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, which is something Israel would want in exchange for that Palestinian statehood? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=197.5s)]
*  Yeah, so I spent most of my time focused on normalization in the Middle East. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=203.22s)]
*  It is the future. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=207.46s)]
*  There will be peace. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=208.46s)]
*  There will be prosperity. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=209.46s)]
*  The question is how that will come about. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=210.78s)]
*  And with the Biden administration, we're looking at a three-plus year track record of failure [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=212.74s)]
*  after failure after failure on policy, especially foreign policy. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=217.66s)]
*  Why do we think that they would get this particular deal correct? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=222.86s)]
*  Israel wants to make peace with Saudi. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=226.54s)]
*  At its core, through Vision 2030, Saudi would like to normalize relationships with Israel. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=228.5s)]
*  All of the rest of the stuff that the U.S. has introduced to this deal will just muddy [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=234.06s)]
*  the water, make the relationship more challenging, and allow the Palestinians, who should not [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=238.74s)]
*  have a veto over progress, not only a veto over progress, but perhaps a positive statement [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=243.5s)]
*  in order to be able to destroy all of the path to normalcy and normalization throughout [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=249.5s)]
*  the Middle East. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=254.3s)]
*  Rabbi, thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=255.3s)]
*  Right outside Tel Aviv. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQwIU1PuuI&t=257.74s)]
