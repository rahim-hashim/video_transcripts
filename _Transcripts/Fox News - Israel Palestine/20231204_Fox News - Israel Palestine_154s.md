# Israeli doctors reveal ‘terrible’ condition of Hamas hostage survivors
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8)
*  All right, we're back with the Fox News lawyer right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8&t=0.0s)]
*  The United States has launched a drone strike in northern Iraq, killing five Iranian proxy [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8&t=2.92s)]
*  fighters. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8&t=9.44s)]
*  Meanwhile, in the Red Sea, the USS Carney shooting down three drones coming from Iran-backed [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8&t=10.44s)]
*  Houthi rebels on Sunday. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8&t=19.16s)]
*  Check back in with Trey Yanks live in southern Israel with the latest. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8&t=21.64s)]
*  What is going on, Trey? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8&t=25.98s)]
*  Yeah, guys, you can hear in the distance there a lot of outgoing artillery fire right now. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8&t=28.92s)]
*  The Israelis are targeting the northern part of the Gaza Strip with what appears to be [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  a large fire mission likely hitting the Sajiya neighborhood, one of the last strongholds [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8&t=38.760000000000005s)]
*  in northern Gaza for Hamas fighters. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  They've been going after leadership there over the past several days. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8&t=46.92s)]
*  We also can report at this hour that Israeli forces are operating on the ground near the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8&t=50.36s)]
*  second largest city in Gaza called Khajn Younis. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8&t=55.78s)]
*  They're actually telling civilians that previously were using the Saladin Road to move from the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8&t=59.18s)]
*  northern part of Gaza to the south, not to use that evacuation corridor right now. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8&t=63.7s)]
*  They are pointing them to the sea to evacuate close to there. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8&t=68.26s)]
*  There's clearly some significant ground fighting taking place, and they say they are pausing [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8&t=71.86s)]
*  military operations in that southern city of Ra'afah to allow for a humanitarian evacuation [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8&t=76.22s)]
*  to get as many civilians out of the way right now. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8&t=82.42s)]
*  This comes as the Israelis are learning more about the hostages that were held inside Gaza [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8&t=85.4s)]
*  as you continue to hear that artillery in the distance. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8&t=90.60000000000001s)]
*  I do want you to take a listen to Ilan Levi, a spokesman for the Israeli government, who [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8&t=93.2s)]
*  had this to say about what they've learned. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8&t=97.12s)]
*  Ilan Levi-Illani was so traumatized by over 50 days of captivity that she refuses to let [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  go of her mother, even to let her go to the bathroom at home. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8&t=107.0s)]
*  Officers are attesting to the consequences for the health of the survivors, saying they [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8&t=111.92s)]
*  have quote, never seen such terrible hygiene as the conditions in which Hamas returned [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8&t=115.9s)]
*  the hostages. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8&t=122.16s)]
*  As the Israelis continue to search for the hostages still inside Gaza, there are questions [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8&t=126.16s)]
*  about what comes next for the ground operation. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8&t=131.18s)]
*  They are now putting pressure on the northern part, the central part, and the southern part [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8&t=134.08s)]
*  of the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8&t=138.12s)]
*  You've got two million civilians, that outgoing artillery right now targeting the northern [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8&t=139.32s)]
*  part of Gaza. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8&t=143.48000000000002s)]
*  But again, the question here is where will those civilians go as the ground and air operations [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  expand? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8&t=149.76s)]
*  Guys? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8&t=150.76s)]
*  That's the big question. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8&t=151.76s)]
*  Trey, thank you very much. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leamRpIPwE8&t=152.76s)]
