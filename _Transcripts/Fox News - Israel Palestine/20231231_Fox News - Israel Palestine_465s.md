# This could have a ‘catastrophic effect’ on our military, GOP rep warns
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM)
*  The Wall Street Journal editorial board wrote this weekend that it's time for President Biden to pardon Alcones, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=0.0s)]
*  writing in part, quote, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=6.4s)]
*  His family notes he was held in jail after his arrest for nearly a month, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=7.9s)]
*  though Japan is supposed to hand over U.S. military members to American authorities [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=12.6s)]
*  absent a compelling reason such as a flight risk. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=17.6s)]
*  These deficiencies may have made it impossible for him to receive a fair shake from the Japanese legal system. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=21.0s)]
*  As more than 30 members of Congress wrote in a letter last year, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=28.2s)]
*  Mr. Biden could pardon Lieutenant Alcones or commute his sentence, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=32.4s)]
*  but the administration appears worried this would upset Tokyo. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=37.0s)]
*  Florida Congressman Michael Waltz joins us now. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=41.5s)]
*  He's been working to try to free Lieutenant Alcones. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=44.9s)]
*  I know you've been on top of this case, Congressman, for a long time. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=48.2s)]
*  Put this in context and you served as a Green Beret, you served in our military, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=51.8s)]
*  you know how this process is supposed to work. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=57.3s)]
*  But it's not as if this guy went out and shot somebody or committed some crime, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=59.5s)]
*  a horrific consequence of the death of two people from a driving accident. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=64.0s)]
*  But this case seems extreme. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=68.89999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Jason, well, first, I want to give full credit to Senator Mike Lee of Utah, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=73.2s)]
*  representative and Navy veteran Nick Lelota of New York, who have tirelessly worked on this case, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=79.9s)]
*  have traveled to Japan repeatedly and pressured the Biden administration to do the right thing [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=86.8s)]
*  and call on the Japanese government to give Lieutenant Alcones back to his family where he belongs. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=93.8s)]
*  You're right. This was a tragedy over in Japan, but it was an accident. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=100.3s)]
*  And what their work and this whole episode is exposed is that our service members [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=105.4s)]
*  are incredibly vulnerable when they are stationed overseas. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=111.2s)]
*  In Lieutenant Alcones's case, yes, he was in Japanese prison and yes, they are a wonderful and great ally, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=115.9s)]
*  but he was denied legal counsel. He was denied an interpreter. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=122.8s)]
*  He was held in solitary confinement. He was treated in the worst of ways. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=125.9s)]
*  I am glad to finally see him home. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=132.5s)]
*  But the fact that he's now being held in a U.S. prison because of a Japanese conviction on an accident [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=135.2s)]
*  and after how he was treated is unconscionable to me. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=143.1s)]
*  I'm calling on President Biden. I am calling on the Department of Justice. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=146.7s)]
*  Release him today. They have the authority to do so. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=150.7s)]
*  Let this brave hero go home to his family and exercise the authority that you have. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=154.1s)]
*  This shouldn't come down to pressure from Congress. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=162.1s)]
*  This is just doing the right thing as leaders, as Americans, and taking care of our troops, taking care of our veterans. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=165.7s)]
*  Let this man go home. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=172.7s)]
*  Yeah, he's served a sentence nearly three years and while he's back in the United States, he's not truly home. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=175.9s)]
*  I mean, he hasn't been able to see his kids for goodness sake since what happened. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=181.5s)]
*  And it's just unconscionable to me that that would not be allowed to happen at this point. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=187.1s)]
*  And I'm just struggling to understand the rationale of why he would continue to be incarcerated, not be pardoned. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=192.7s)]
*  It seems as if the administration is much more concerned about Japan's feelings on this than they are about taking care of a U.S. service member. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=200.9s)]
*  Well, Jason, very quickly, what we don't know, what we're asking the administration, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=212.70000000000002s)]
*  was some kind of deal cut with the Japanese government that he would be detained here at home. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=215.9s)]
*  We don't know. And we and his family deserve transparency. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=221.70000000000002s)]
*  But there's bigger impacts here. We have 50,000 service members stationed in Japan. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=225.5s)]
*  And when they see one of their fellow veterans, a naval officer, being treated this way, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=231.3s)]
*  and we're looking at a recruiting crisis and a retention crisis, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=236.9s)]
*  I guarantee you their families are starting to question whether we should re-enlist if this is how we're going to be treated by an allied government and by our own government. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=240.7s)]
*  And then more broadly, and again, I give Senator Lee and Rep. Lillodeau credit, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=251.89999999999998s)]
*  we have language in the defense bill we just passed to take a harder look directing the administration to review the over 100 status of forces agreements, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=255.89999999999998s)]
*  which govern how our service members are treated when they're overseas by the local governments. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=266.7s)]
*  They need to review those agreements. We need to make sure that our service members are taken care of. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=272.09999999999997s)]
*  And our language in the defense bill is directing the administration to do that over the next year. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=278.3s)]
*  Very good. I want to transition, Congressman. Your service in our military is vital here. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=286.3s)]
*  You know, the Americans' assets and personnel have been attacked more than 100 times. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=292.7s)]
*  And we seem to respond to that or defend ourselves to a degree. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=298.3s)]
*  But we got service members, one was injured and was in critical condition. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=302.3s)]
*  Are we just going to continue to take incoming fire or are we actually going to do something about it? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=308.7s)]
*  Yeah, Jason, this is just maddening. I can tell you on good authority that our ship captains right now being fired upon by the Houthis with Iranian-made and trained anti-ship missiles. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=315.1s)]
*  They don't have the authority to shoot back at the shooters themselves. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=329.1s)]
*  They only have the authority to shoot down the missiles. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=333.1s)]
*  It's like telling a cop who's being shot at you can dodge the bullets, you can swat down the bullets, but you can't shoot the shooter. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=336.1s)]
*  And that's what we have to be able to do. Not only take out the Houthis that are launching these things at our ships and at international shipping. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=343.1s)]
*  This is an attack on the whole world because 20 percent of global trade passes through that sea. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=351.1s)]
*  But we have to go after Iran itself. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=357.1s)]
*  And what President Trump knew was that only when you take out something Iran cares about, one of its field generals, some of its financial assets, only when you when you hurt the regime itself, will peace be restored. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=359.1s)]
*  Sometimes you have to escalate to de-escalate. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=372.1s)]
*  But this administration is so afraid of escalation that eventually, Jason, one of these missiles are going to get through. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=375.1s)]
*  It's going to sink one of our ships. It's going to do more than just critically wound. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=382.1s)]
*  It's going to have a catastrophic effect on one of our bases. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=386.1s)]
*  And meanwhile, Iran looks like the tough guy around the Middle East and the United States once again under Joe Biden looks feckless and weak. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=389.1s)]
*  So the ramifications of this are broad and wide. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=399.1s)]
*  And finally, all of those ships that were surging into the Middle East, they should be in the Pacific countering China. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=401.1s)]
*  They that aircraft carrier, the USS Ford, should have been home by Christmas. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=409.1s)]
*  So, again, it's family. You know, those family members of those sailors are saying, you know what, maybe the military isn't for us. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=414.1s)]
*  Maybe we don't reenlist. You are supposed to be home. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=421.1s)]
*  You're not allowed to fully defend yourself. You're not allowed to take out the shooters. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=424.1s)]
*  You'll be treated badly by our allies and by our own government if you have some type of car accident. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=428.1s)]
*  And you wonder why we're in the worst recruiting retention crisis since Vietnam. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=434.1s)]
*  It's because of bad policy by and bad leadership by this White House. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=440.1s)]
*  Congressman Michael Waltz, thank you for your service in our military and thanks for joining us on Sunday Morning Futures. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=447.1s)]
*  We do appreciate it. Happy New Year. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=452.1s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTXB-HhnUM&t=454.1s)]
