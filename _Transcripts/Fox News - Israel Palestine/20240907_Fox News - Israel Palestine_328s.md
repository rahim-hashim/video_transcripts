# ‘BLATANTLY CLEAR’: Columbia graduate sends heated message to protestors
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [September 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg)
*  They're calling for the death to design this entity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=0.0s)]
*  They're calling for the eradication of America. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=2.92s)]
*  Even though this semester all they've done is throw red paint on the statue and block [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=6.0s)]
*  entrances for one day, we have to live in fear of what they could do next when they [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=10.92s)]
*  choose inevitably to escalate. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=16.52s)]
*  They are trying to terrorize us. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=18.92s)]
*  They are terrorists. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=21.1s)]
*  That was a Columbia University student saying anti-Semitic protesters act like terrorists [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=23.38s)]
*  as the new semester kicked off earlier this week with protests at the campus. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=29.32s)]
*  Joining us to tell us more is Columbia University graduate, excuse me, Katie Arie. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=34.08s)]
*  Thank you so much, Katie, for being here. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=41.2s)]
*  So I just mentioned you graduated in May. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=42.72s)]
*  You're still active in the halal. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=45.0s)]
*  And you also still have friends on campus. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  I want you to take a listen to what this protester said. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=49.08s)]
*  I think there are a lot of responses to that, especially as a Jewish student myself. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=51.72s)]
*  I don't want to discount the seriousness of anti-Semitism, but I think that the vast [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=58.04s)]
*  majority of claims have been either outright deceitful or have been overinflated. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=62.8s)]
*  Katie, what are your thoughts on that? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=68.72s)]
*  Overinflated, she's saying about anti-Semitism on campus. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=71.96s)]
*  You know, unfortunately, amongst this woke culture that has unfortunately brainwashed [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=76.44s)]
*  our fellow my fellow students into believing that there is this binary of oppressed and oppressor. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=82.68s)]
*  There are a few token Jewish students who have sadly fallen prey to this narrative, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=88.12s)]
*  whether that's out of fear of being ostracized by fellow students or for other reasons. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=94.4s)]
*  I can't speak to their own morality, but it's been blatantly clear not only in the task force, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=102.64000000000001s)]
*  anti-Semitism Task Force reports, there's been extreme anti-Semitism on campus, but [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=109.8s)]
*  also that there's been extreme anti-American rhetoric being spewed on these campuses. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=114.88s)]
*  These people have shown a complete disregard for morality, a complete disregard for laws [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=120.44s)]
*  and what's right and what needs to be upheld in this country and on our campus. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=126.8s)]
*  And the administration has very sadly condoned this behavior. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=130.4s)]
*  And I can say, I don't know that student personally, but the student standing next to him was confronted [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=133.48s)]
*  with the idea of he was quote, a Westerner advocating for the total eradication of Western [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=138.60000000000002s)]
*  civilization like Columbia University, apartheid divest claimed that they were. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=143.76000000000002s)]
*  And he confirmed that in fact, he was one of those students who believed that. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=149.0s)]
*  So unfortunately, these people have spewed misinformation, disinformation and just flat [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=152.88s)]
*  out lies for now 11 months since the day in Israel of that brutal attack on Israeli and [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=158.44s)]
*  American civilians. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=164.58s)]
*  And so unfortunately, what they say now can't even be taken with a grain of salty. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=166.22s)]
*  They're completely incredible. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=169.94s)]
*  Well, and as you mentioned, one month from today will mark one year since the October [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=170.94s)]
*  7th attacks. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=176.3s)]
*  And now we know, according to the DOJ, there's been an arrest of a man who is planning attacks [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=177.3s)]
*  in New York City on October 7th, this upcoming October 7th. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=183.74s)]
*  And also in their documentation, the DOJ said that part of the concern and what this suspect [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=189.70000000000002s)]
*  said was that New York is a good place to attack people who are Jewish. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=196.22s)]
*  What is it like for you to be in New York City right now? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=201.94s)]
*  It's terrifying. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=205.94s)]
*  It's terrifying as a Jewish young woman, but also it's terrifying as an American. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=206.94s)]
*  I mean, these people have shown over and over and over again with saying things like they [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=210.82s)]
*  are Westerners advocating for the total eradication of Western society. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=215.5s)]
*  They believe that America needs to be quote, eradicated and eliminated. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=219.56s)]
*  They believe it's evil. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=224.06s)]
*  They burn Israeli flags, but they also burn American flags. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=225.1s)]
*  They are clearly immoral. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=228.98s)]
*  They clearly want to spew this godless, hateful gospel around. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=230.46s)]
*  And unfortunately, we see it in Colombia as a really good example of how this hate gets [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=235.18s)]
*  spewed and gets condoned, right? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=241.45999999999998s)]
*  When students leave their homes, they're leaving their parents who are the moral boundaries, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=243.26s)]
*  whatever morality that is that they share with their children. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=249.14s)]
*  When they come to a place where the administration is supposed to serve in that role and when [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=252.02s)]
*  the administration has 18 out of 22 students who broke into a building with hammers, took [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=255.82s)]
*  over their private property, held a poor facilities worker hostage while they screamed for death [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=262.62s)]
*  to America and death to Israel. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=269.5s)]
*  When they have 18 of those 22 students in good standing with the university, it shows [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=271.34s)]
*  that this is morally acceptable at Colombia. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=276.26s)]
*  And unfortunately, when the district attorney in New York dropped those charges against [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=279.06s)]
*  these people who clearly broke the law and clearly have a disregard for the law and just [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=283.86s)]
*  want to bring hate and death to the U.S. as Iran calls the U.S. the great Satan and Israel [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=288.94s)]
*  the little Satan, they clearly feel similarly. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=295.02s)]
*  And he dropped all the charges against them. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=297.52s)]
*  That shows them that this is okay. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=299.02s)]
*  And I'm not surprised. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=300.42s)]
*  I was sickened by the reports of the potential terrorist attack, but they believe that quote, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=301.42s)]
*  Osama bin Laden did what he had to do and they continue to show that that's what they [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=306.62s)]
*  believe and they're going to support it. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=310.42s)]
*  And unfortunately, unless it's stopped, it's going to continue. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=311.7s)]
*  Well, Katie, we're so glad that you're here today. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=314.1s)]
*  Your voice is so important. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=316.34000000000003s)]
*  Thank you very much for being here. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9BYamvIRg&t=317.34000000000003s)]
