# Kamala Harris is snubbing, boycotting Israel: Elise Stefanik
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [July 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0)
*  Dana. So not exactly a warm welcome for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Democratic [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=0.0s)]
*  boycotts and mass protests prompting the New York Post headline Israel Left Behind. Congresswoman [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=4.8s)]
*  Elise Stefanik, Republican of New York and chair of the House Republican Conference. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=10.48s)]
*  So much to get to here. I mean, there was a big protest yesterday. I don't know who [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=13.84s)]
*  they think they're persuading. And you had this quote from Walter Russell Meen in the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=17.28s)]
*  Wall Street Journal saying that tensions between Bibi Netanyahu and Kamala Harris. Harris is [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=21.56s)]
*  expected to meet Netanyahu during his visit to Washington. But the snub is unmistakable. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=26.86s)]
*  It is fueling rumors of a rift between the Harrison Biden approaches to the Middle East. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=32.14s)]
*  How do you see it this morning, Congresswoman? Well, this is a snub and it is a boycott and [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=37.06s)]
*  it is absolutely a disgrace that the sitting vice president of the United States would [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=41.9s)]
*  not attend what I believe will be one of the most important speeches at one of the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=46.019999999999996s)]
*  gravest national security threats that the world faces. That is the bloodiest day for [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=49.82s)]
*  the Jewish people when Hamas attacked a terrorist group backed by Iran, attacked Israel, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=54.22s)]
*  our most precious ally. So it is inexcusable. But Dana, this is where the Democrat Party [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=59.26s)]
*  is today. As Bill Hemmer just said, that number is going to be over 80 Democrats who [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=63.78s)]
*  boycott this important joint address. House Republicans are committed to strongly [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=68.62s)]
*  supporting Israel. We will continue to show that moral and national security leadership [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=74.06s)]
*  on the world stage. And Prime Minister Netanyahu is making history today. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=78.58s)]
*  This will be the head of state who has delivered the most joint addresses to the United [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=82.74000000000001s)]
*  States Congress, beating Winston Churchill. I think back to my freshman term in 2015, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=87.38s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu delivered another historic speech to Congress. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=92.74000000000001s)]
*  It was the first one I ever attended talking about his opposition to the flawed Iranian [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=96.7s)]
*  nuclear agreement. And you know who boycotted that? Joe Biden, when he was vice president. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=101.74000000000001s)]
*  So this is today's Democrat Party. It's a disgrace. Here's a montage of Democrats [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=105.98s)]
*  saying that they won't go and why. I am not attending. I don't think Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=110.58s)]
*  has any interest in getting to peace in the Middle East. I certainly am not going to go. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=116.1s)]
*  I didn't go the last time he was here. I will never be supporting him. I'm not going because [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=121.25999999999999s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu has led that region into a complete humanitarian disaster. Why don't they [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=127.14s)]
*  ever blame Hamas? It's because they are becoming the pro-terrorist wing of the Democrat Party. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=136.82s)]
*  Again, take a step back, Dana. Israel is a growing democracy, the strongest democracy, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=143.45999999999998s)]
*  the only democracy in the Middle East. They have respect for human rights and they have a right to [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=148.7s)]
*  defend themselves. What I hope and I believe we will hear from Prime Minister Netanyahu is how [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=153.82s)]
*  we're going to eradicate the terrorist who slaughtered civilians in Israel, beheaded babies, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=158.9s)]
*  burnt women, and have eight Americans who were abducted and kidnapped who are being burrowed [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=165.62s)]
*  away in tunnels among the terrorist regime in Gaza. So we as the United States need to [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=172.62s)]
*  strongly stand with Israel. House Republicans are committed to doing so and President Trump [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=178.46s)]
*  was the strongest U.S. president when it comes to supporting Israel. Compare that with Kamala [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=183.34s)]
*  Harris who is refusing to attend this address. I also want to get to this. You have introduced [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=188.62s)]
*  a resolution condemning the border czar Kamala Harris over her role in the crisis. You say that [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=194.14s)]
*  the record, this is the record we have here, she was okay with taxpayer-funded health care for [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=199.57999999999998s)]
*  illegal immigrants, decriminalizing border crossing, so no penalties for lawbreakers, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=204.94s)]
*  and support of sanctuary cities, limiting cooperation with federal authorities. The spokesman [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=209.89999999999998s)]
*  for the White House, Andrew Bates, he says as we speak, congressional Republicans continue their [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=214.7s)]
*  months-long blockade of critical resources for ICE and the Border Patrol in the tough bipartisan [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=218.61999999999998s)]
*  border security agreement supported by the Biden-Harris administration. Is she on her back [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=223.5s)]
*  foot when it comes to this issue, getting into this race? She's on her back foot. She's going to [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=229.98s)]
*  even be more on her back foot, and I think we're at a high watermark for Kamala Harris's polling. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=234.3s)]
*  It's going to go lower. She was designated by Joe Biden as the borders czar, and what has happened, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=238.38s)]
*  the most catastrophic open border in our nation's history. The number one issue, no matter what [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=243.18s)]
*  congressional district, no matter what state you pull, is this border crisis, and Kamala Harris [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=247.42000000000002s)]
*  owns it lock, stock and barrel. She oversaw the gravest national security threat, economic threat, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=252.22s)]
*  the fact that 500 individuals on the terrorist watch list crossed the border illegally during [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=257.5s)]
*  Kamala Harris's role as borders czar. She owns this border crisis, and it's going to be a driving [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=261.74s)]
*  factor going into this election cycle. And again, Dana, as Democrats in backroom deals [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=266.38s)]
*  didn't allow voters across this country to select their nominee, Kamala Harris has been designated [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=271.66s)]
*  by Democrat donors and Democrat elites, but the American people are smart. They know that she [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=277.5s)]
*  owns the failures of the Biden Harris administration, whether it's the border crisis, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=282.14s)]
*  whether it's the historic inflation crisis, and voters are going to hold her accountable. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=286.53999999999996s)]
*  Compare that to the success, the most secure border in modern history under President Trump [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=290.38s)]
*  and the booming economy. So I think this will be a stark contrast and choice this election cycle [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=295.02s)]
*  this November, and President Trump is going to win on these issues. So much more to talk about [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=300.06s)]
*  with you. Please keep us posted on how that speech goes today. Netanyahu addressing the Congress [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=304.38s)]
*  at two p.m. Thank you. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilmeade. And I'm Ainsley Earhart. And [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADB9mJN75p0&t=309.09999999999997s)]
