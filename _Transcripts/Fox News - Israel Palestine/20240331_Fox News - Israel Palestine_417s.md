# GOP senator urges Biden to put ‘everything on the table’
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [March 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU)
*  Joining us now, GOP Senator Rick Scott of Florida. Senator Scott, welcome back to Fox News Sunday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, happy Easter. It's a special day for Christians. It absolutely is. And [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=6.36s)]
*  we, by the way, just have a statement from the White House on that. We're gonna get to that a little bit later in the show. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  There's been some controversy you may have heard, but I want to start here with the bridge and us just talking with Governor Moore. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=15.56s)]
*  There is talk that some of this will have to come through a funding package in [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=21.88s)]
*  Congress where you guys are fighting over a lot of things. Do you see that moving? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=25.6s)]
*  Well, first off, my heart goes out to everybody [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=30.56s)]
*  that lost their life, and I hope they found, you know, the bodies. I feel sorry for those families, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=33.56s)]
*  and I know it's gonna take a lot of work. Look, this is, this should be an issue that we all come together. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=38.56s)]
*  Unfortunately, the Biden administration has played politics. I still have Florida farmers from a hurricane a year and a half ago [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=43.56s)]
*  that still aren't getting relief. So the federal government is a partner. The federal government needs to be [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=49.56s)]
*  a partner, but we need to stop playing politics, and that's exactly what the Biden administration has done. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  Well, let's talk about, speaking of politics, you're fresh back from a trip to Israel. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  The Biden administration has both publicly and privately [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=66.12s)]
*  created some distance when it comes to how it feels about the current administration there [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=69.12s)]
*  in Israel, and the vice president just days ago was asked about consequences if Israel moves into Rafa with this planned ground invasion. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=73.12s)]
*  Here's what she said. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=81.12s)]
*  Are you ruling out that there would be consequences from the United States? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=83.68s)]
*  I am ruling out nothing. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=87.68s)]
*  What do you think those consequences are, and how is that public talk, that position going over with Israeli leaders? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=89.68s)]
*  It's not going over well. I met with President, Prime Minister Netanyahu and other, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=97.68s)]
*  the foreign minister, the defense minister, they know that they have to go into Rafa to destroy Hamas. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=101.68s)]
*  They have to destroy Hamas. They need American support, but they're gonna go into, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=106.68s)]
*  they're gonna go into Rafa to get rid of Hamas, whether the US supports them or not. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=112.24000000000001s)]
*  I don't understand it. We still have American hostages. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  I met with families of, that, you know, their family, American hostage families over, while I was over there. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=119.24000000000001s)]
*  I went to one of the kibitz I'd been to in 2019, where 60, over 60 Jews were killed just because they're Jews. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  Kids, people were raped. They were just shot at point blank. They were burned alive. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=132.24s)]
*  I went to a music festival where 363 people were killed just because they were Jews. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=137.8s)]
*  There's over 40 hostages. I met with IDF soldiers. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=142.8s)]
*  They need American support. Here's my takeaway. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=146.8s)]
*  Number one, they need and deserve American support. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=148.8s)]
*  They have to go into Rafa to destroy Hamas. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=152.8s)]
*  Number two, Qatar needs to get the hostages out. They need to be held accountable for doing that. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=155.8s)]
*  Number three, Iran needs to be held accountable. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=159.8s)]
*  And then we all have to do everything we can to support them. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=163.36s)]
*  So I'm going to work hard to get these hostages home. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=168.36s)]
*  I think the Biden administration and Democrats need to change their tune. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=172.36s)]
*  They vote against Israel aid. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=175.36s)]
*  You know, they didn't see, America didn't even stand up for Israel at the UN, with the UN resolution. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=177.36s)]
*  I mean, this is disgusting what the Biden administration is doing. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=182.36s)]
*  Support Israel. They've got to kill Hamas. They just, they'll never get their country back. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=185.36s)]
*  At the same time, there are numerous reports out there that billions more in weapons, bombs, fighter jets are flowing to Israel from the Biden administration. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=190.92000000000002s)]
*  So is this a matter of, in your estimation, publicly talking tough, but privately the U.S. is getting Israel what it needs? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  And that's despite pressure from the left. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=205.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, there's going to be, this is a long fight. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=208.92000000000002s)]
*  There's going to be a time where they're going to need more weapons. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  There's been prior weapons packages that is given Israel aid, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=215.48s)]
*  but there's going to need to be more aid given to be able to destroy Hamas. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=220.48s)]
*  And by the way, we've got to, we've got to focus on destroying Hamas. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=224.48s)]
*  And we've also got to focus on what are we doing to get these hostages out? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=229.48s)]
*  Why isn't the Biden administration doing anything to hold Qatar accountable for what's going on over here? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=233.48s)]
*  Well, and to that point, I want to read this is from Richard Goldberg, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=238.48s)]
*  the foundation for Defense of Democracy is a former Trump administration security official. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=242.04s)]
*  He says, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=246.04s)]
*  What more do you think this administration should or could be doing with regard to Qatar? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=267.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, they need to put everything on the table. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=272.04s)]
*  Why do we have a military base in Qatar when they're holding, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=275.04s)]
*  when they're hosting the leaders of Hamas? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=278.04s)]
*  And why aren't they, they could by themselves, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=281.04s)]
*  Qatar right now could tell Hamas, you will be leaving the country, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=284.04s)]
*  unless these hostages are released today. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=287.04s)]
*  And guess what? Those hostages would be released today. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=290.04s)]
*  Hamas, I mean, Qatar doesn't want to do that. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=293.04s)]
*  They don't want to lose our military base. I don't get it. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=296.04s)]
*  I mean, they're holding a military base in the same place where your enemy is being hosted by the government. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=298.6s)]
*  How can we do that? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=303.6s)]
*  I mean, that doesn't make any sense to me. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=305.6s)]
*  And they're hosting, holding American hostages. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=307.6s)]
*  I want the Biden administration to start talking about the fact we have American families [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=310.6s)]
*  being held hostage in Hamas, in Gaza by Hamas. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=314.6s)]
*  And we have Israeli families. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=318.6s)]
*  What are you, what is Biden doing to get those out? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=320.6s)]
*  Stop talking about what, you know, stop criticizing the Netanyahu [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=323.6s)]
*  administration, by the way, is Biden won a war? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=327.6s)]
*  Has Biden fought in a war? No. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=330.04s)]
*  He doesn't. What's his background in doing this? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=332.04s)]
*  How does he know better how to go into Rafa and get rid of Hamas? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=334.04s)]
*  He doesn't. Makes you mad when you hear this stuff. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=337.04s)]
*  I want to really quickly ask you about the peer that has been proposed to set up [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=340.04s)]
*  and bring in humanitarian aid into Gaza. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=344.04s)]
*  U.S. troops supposed to help set that up, run that operation, but not set ground, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=346.04s)]
*  not set foot into Gaza. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=350.04s)]
*  The IDF apparently is going to expend their resources to create a security bubble there. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=352.04s)]
*  There are people on both sides of the aisle here in D.C. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=357.48s)]
*  that are growing increasingly worried that U.S. troops are going to be endangered by that [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=359.48s)]
*  operation or be pulled into something more broadly. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=363.48s)]
*  What's your take? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=366.48s)]
*  Well, first of all, IDF is doing everything they can to protect civilians. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=368.48s)]
*  Who's not is Hamas. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=371.48s)]
*  So I do not want American soldiers at risk, all right, in Gaza. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=373.48s)]
*  That's not fair to American soldiers. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=378.48s)]
*  We've asked and we have a letter to the White House asking, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=380.48s)]
*  tell us what your plan is to make sure Americans, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=382.92s)]
*  Americans men and women are not put at risk. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=385.92s)]
*  We watched what happened with Afghanistan, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=387.92s)]
*  with the withdrawal where we lost 13 service men and women. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=389.92s)]
*  This administration doesn't seem to need to have a plan for anything because it doesn't. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=392.92s)]
*  We haven't heard what their plan is to do this. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=396.92s)]
*  But I know that Netanyahu, the leadership in Israel, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=398.92s)]
*  the IDF is doing everything they can to protect civilians and who's not is Hamas. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=402.92s)]
*  Senator Scott, thank you for sharing your insights after just getting back from that [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=407.92s)]
*  trip. We appreciate your time. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=412.36s)]
*  Thank you, Shannon. Happy Easter. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKR8dSpN7GU&t=415.36s)]
