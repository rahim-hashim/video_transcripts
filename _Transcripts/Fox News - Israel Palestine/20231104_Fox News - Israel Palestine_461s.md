# Qatar must decide ‘which side of history’ they want to be on: George Birnbaum
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E)
*  One of the things that Anthony Lincoln hopes to gauge, at least talking to a lot of these Arab leaders with whom we'll be meeting throughout the course of the day, is how strong they are on this pause. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=0.0s)]
*  Some go so far as to say a ceasefire. In fact, a majority of those leaders have been demanding that right now. Forget just a temporary pause. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=10.0s)]
*  George Birnbaum, the former chief of staff to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Mr. Birnbaum, very good to have you back. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=16.0s)]
*  Let me ask you about that pause for any length of time. Seems understandably so when we hear the prime minister explain the reasons and what they've been dealing with, justified here. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=22.0s)]
*  But you're feeling the pressure, and I'm sure the prime minister is. How do you respond to that? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=34.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, there is pressure. But there is a duty to the Jewish people in the state of Israel to continue this fight and not let up. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=39.0s)]
*  Certainly the pain and suffering that the Palestinian people are feeling in Gaza is not something that anybody wants. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=50.0s)]
*  But we have to look at the facts. The facts are that I don't think anyone does well under a government led by Islamic extremists. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=57.0s)]
*  So it's the Taliban in Afghanistan, the Atollos in Iran, Hezbollah in Lebanon, or Hamas in Gaza. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=66.0s)]
*  There are plenty of examples around the world of successful Muslim countries like Indonesia and the United Emirates and others. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=73.0s)]
*  We have to get rid of the fundamentalists. We have to get rid of the radical Islamists. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=80.0s)]
*  And so, yes, I'm sure everyone wants to ceasefire. I don't think a single parent of an Israeli soldier wants to continue risking their sons and daughters lives. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=84.0s)]
*  But this has to be done until we eradicate the Islamic fundamentalists from Gaza. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=93.0s)]
*  So if that is the goal, and I understand the goal, Hamas has essential and had all this time, certainly since 2007, control of Gaza. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=98.0s)]
*  That goes away. But you want to go a step further from that and just annihilate Hamas. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=106.0s)]
*  But a lot of people in this country want to know what does that ultimately mean? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=112.0s)]
*  It's one thing for them not to have any control in Gaza, period, but to annihilate. Maybe just tell me. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=117.0s)]
*  Well, it doesn't only include ridding Hamas of any ability to lead and control Gaza. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=124.0s)]
*  It also includes taking care of the four or five Hamas billionaires living in Qatar when you have Mashal who's worth, I think, five billion and Kania worth four billion. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=131.0s)]
*  I mean, when you look at how their people suffer in Gaza and you've got these billionaires controlling the radicals in Gaza, that has to also be eradicated. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=145.0s)]
*  So we have to eradicate. You know, we always talk about taking off the head of the snake. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=155.0s)]
*  Hamas in Gaza is one thing, but the head of the snake lives in Doha. They are billionaires. We have to get rid of them, too. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=161.0s)]
*  You know, it's interesting, too, because you mentioned Qatar and you think of this role they're playing in opening up this passageway with Egypt and Ra'a. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=168.0s)]
*  And then I'm thinking to myself, you know, they're portraying themselves as a friend to Israel in this process to try to protect individuals. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=174.0s)]
*  You seem to have a very different view of their role here. And they do house a number of Hamas militants as well. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=182.0s)]
*  So I'm just wondering how ever this is ultimately sorted out, what will be done about Qatar, what will be done about some of these Arab countries that not only house but comfort and pay some of the worst Hamas elements? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=190.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, Qatar and other nations will have to decide which side of history they want to be on. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=209.0s)]
*  Well, they've already decided, right? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=214.0s)]
*  They may have to have a gut check. And when this is over, we'll know where they stand. Right now, they're standing with the terrorists. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=217.0s)]
*  Right now, they're standing with those who fundraise and deliver technology and weapons to terrorists. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=227.0s)]
*  They're going to have to and I hope that the U.S. and other nations will put pressure on Qatar to eradicate those elements from their country when this is over as well, because it cannot keep up with the current situation. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=234.0s)]
*  We can get rid of Hamas in Gaza. As long as the head of the snake continues to exist and fundraise and live their billionaire lifestyles, this will continue. We have to get rid of both. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=246.0s)]
*  You know, you're a good reader, the global reaction to all of this, and I'm sure you're aware that from the United Nations to virtually all the major Arab nations, to say nothing of a lot of Western nations that are urging Israel to cool it, don't overdo it, don't respond disproportionately. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=256.0s)]
*  Do you ever feel that there was none of this rage four weeks ago this morning when I was sitting where I am now and these attacks were first being waged? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=273.0s)]
*  Very little reaction and condemnation to that. And within, you know, literally 72 hours, it had seemed Hamas was in this odd position of winning then, even now, the PR war. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=283.0s)]
*  Let me tell you something, Neil. Your viewers can see here the yellow star that my father wore during the Holocaust. Gilead Ardan, the UN ambassador from Israel, wore a yellow star in the Security Council the other day to remind the UN why the UN was created. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=298.0s)]
*  It was to stop genocide. It was to say never again. And to me, never again is not a PR battle. Never again is a very serious, serious saying. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=317.0s)]
*  And I think Israel will continue to do what it needs to do, regardless of winning or losing the PR battle, because this can never happen again. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=327.0s)]
*  And we are committed to never letting it happen again. And so, yeah, I mean, you know, we may have ups and downs when it comes to the PR battle. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=337.0s)]
*  We may have some people supporting us, other nations being against us. Israel will never let this happen again. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=346.0s)]
*  And so that's what we have to remain focused on and not be caught up in the battle of PR and who's winning or losing PR, but rather making sure that genocide never happens again. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=353.0s)]
*  You know, we're watching right now a protest going on in Paris, George. These are pro-Palestinian protests. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=362.0s)]
*  We've seen a number of them right where I am now in New York City. Another one expected this weekend in Washington, D.C., a very big one, which will be featuring pro-Palestinian protesters. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=369.0s)]
*  These are in Western nations, Western governments. How do you feel about that? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=379.0s)]
*  Well, I think we have to be vigilant, but I think we have to also remind everyone that to be pro-Palestinian means getting rid of Hamas. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=385.0s)]
*  We wanted a two-state solution. They've said no to three different prime ministers to having a two-state solution. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=394.0s)]
*  We want the Palestinians to live side by side with us. We want to coexist. We want to prosper together. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=400.0s)]
*  Maybe that isn't really the goal here. Maybe that's just a ruse. Maybe this attack four weeks ago proves that that was not the goal. The goal was something more dramatic. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=406.0s)]
*  I think you're right, Neil. I think you remember when they say pro-Palestinian now, they're not saying pro-Palestinian. They're saying free Palestine. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=414.0s)]
*  They're saying free Palestine from the river to the sea. What they're talking about is being pro-genocidal. They want to eliminate the Jewish state. They want to eliminate the Jewish people. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=422.0s)]
*  And so, yes, they're going to protest, but our voices are going to be just as loud, if not louder. And we've seen strong world support push back against these protests. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=430.0s)]
*  All right, Mr. Rembert, I'm very good seeing you again. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=440.0s)]
*  Thank you, Neil. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQC8QJxnt2E&t=442.0s)]
