# Sen. Graham calls out Biden admin over pausing aid to Israel
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [May 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA)
*  including American hostages and destroy Hamas to get justice for the worst atrocity against [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=0.0s)]
*  Jews since World War II and to prevent the next atrocity. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=6.4s)]
*  Hamas' goal is also simple, survive. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=10.28s)]
*  Hamas' leaders and its last four battalions are holed up in Ra'afah, so Israel has to [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=14.4s)]
*  defeat Hamas in Ra'afah to win. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=19.740000000000002s)]
*  Hamas wins if it survives in Ra'afah, and Joe Biden has threatened to withhold weapons [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=24.12s)]
*  from Israel for fighting in Ra'afah. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=29.8s)]
*  Therefore, Joe Biden objectively favors a Hamas victory over Israel. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=32.88s)]
*  It's just that simple. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=38.8s)]
*  And the President is only emboldening Hamas. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=41.08s)]
*  Why would Hamas release hostages when Joe Biden will give Hamas exactly what it wants, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=44.64s)]
*  survival without releasing hostages? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=51.44s)]
*  He's also emboldening Iran. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=54.44s)]
*  Here's what Joe Biden has done since October 7th. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=57.0s)]
*  Sanctions for Israelis and an arms embargo on Israel. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=60.52s)]
*  Sanctions relief and the end of an arms embargo on Iran. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=65.12s)]
*  Now some people say Joe Biden is doing this for his reelection, which would be bad enough. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=70.92s)]
*  It would also, I have to add, be grounds for impeachment under the Democrats' Trump-Ukraine [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=76.92s)]
*  standard, withholding foreign aid to help one's reelection. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=82.48s)]
*  Only with Joe Biden, it's true. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=88.16s)]
*  But I'm afraid it's also worse than that. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden and Israel-hating Democrats are using electoral concerns as a pretext to do [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=95.26s)]
*  what they've always wanted to do, to cut Israel loose. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  Remember a lot of Barack Obama's aides, who are now Joe Biden's aides, disputed that Hamas [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=107.8s)]
*  was even a real terrorist group to begin with. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=112.72s)]
*  For that matter, remember that Joe Biden himself threatened Israeli Prime Minister Menachem [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=116.68s)]
*  Begin more than 40 years ago with cutting off aid to Israel. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=122.02s)]
*  Begin humiliated Biden, warning him not to threaten Israel and saying, I'm not a Jew [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=129.32s)]
*  with trembling knees. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=135.92s)]
*  Israel is fighting a just and necessary war. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=139.04s)]
*  Their knees are not trembling. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  As Prime Minister Netanyahu just said, they'll fight alone if they have to. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  But let me assure all the Israelis watching, you won't have to fight alone. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=150.1s)]
*  You don't have a problem with America. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=156.56s)]
*  You have a problem with Joe Biden and Chuck Schumer and the Democratic Party. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=158.79999999999998s)]
*  And the American people are going to solve that problem for you in six months. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=164.2s)]
*  Well, thank you, Lindsay, for your leadership on this and all issues that pertain not only [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=174.36s)]
*  to America's national security interests, but to that of our allies. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=180.72s)]
*  72% of Americans support the idea that Israel needs to take the actions necessary to protect [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=185.56s)]
*  itself and to end the rule and reign of Hamas, a terrorist organization operating not only [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=194.39999999999998s)]
*  there but in an entire region of the world. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=199.6s)]
*  That is a much larger percentage of the American people, obviously, than support what Joe Biden [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=203.04s)]
*  is doing. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=208.72s)]
*  And as has been pointed out, this is an opportunity for America to stand shoulder to shoulder [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=209.72s)]
*  with our closest ally and to convey to the people of that country that the United States [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=218.4s)]
*  is a reliable ally and that we can be counted on. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=223.72s)]
*  The problem with what's happening with the Biden administration today is not only does [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=226.92s)]
*  it force people to question our reliability as an ally, it puts Israel's national security [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=230.76s)]
*  interests at risk. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=237.24s)]
*  This is insane what is being suggested by this administration after the Congress in [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=239.44s)]
*  huge bipartisan fashion supported over $14 billion to go to aid Israel. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=245.39999999999998s)]
*  This administration would decide unilaterally without any input from Congress or anybody [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=251.32s)]
*  else that because they don't like the way that Israel is defending itself against this [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=257.2s)]
*  threat that somehow they're going to start cutting off the very assistance that the United [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=261.47999999999996s)]
*  States Congress said that we want sent to Israel to our ally to make sure that they're [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=266.2s)]
*  able to defend themselves and to root out this terrorist organization operating on their [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=271.24s)]
*  border. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=278.24s)]
*  The American people support Israel overwhelmingly as has already been pointed out. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=279.24s)]
*  And they also believe that Israel needs to do what is necessary. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=286.72s)]
*  And if that includes going into Ra'a to root out the Hamas threat, then that is necessary [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=291.76000000000005s)]
*  for their very survival. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=298.24s)]
*  This is an existential threat for the people of Israel. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=299.44s)]
*  The United States need to have their back. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=302.28s)]
*  We have their back. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=304.84s)]
*  The American people have their back. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=306.16s)]
*  The Republicans here in the United States Senate have their back. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=307.71999999999997s)]
*  And we will do everything we possibly can to make sure that Joe Biden, notwithstanding [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=310.56s)]
*  his statements of the last few days here, does what the American people and the United [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=315.76s)]
*  States Congress have said we need to be doing to support our strongest ally in the world. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=321.2s)]
*  Well, first, Lindsay, thank you so much for your leadership. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=329.84s)]
*  Let's review a little bit of recent history. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=334.36s)]
*  As Senator Thune has just outlined, it was the administration that put together a supplemental [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=337.84s)]
*  funding request to provide weapons systems, munitions, equipment, and other means of assistance [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=346.04s)]
*  to Israel. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=356.6s)]
*  This repeatedly, by overwhelming bipartisan margins, supported that funding, supported [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=359.12s)]
*  assisting our closest ally in the Middle East, Israel. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=368.96s)]
*  And what did the administration do? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=374.52s)]
*  Without any consultation over the weekend, the administration decides to halt the delivery [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=378.12s)]
*  of essential weapons to Israel. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=386.52s)]
*  They did not inform the Appropriations Committee. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=389.8s)]
*  They did not inform the Formulations Committee. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=394.02s)]
*  They did not inform the Armed Services Committee. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=398.4s)]
*  It was a unilateral decision. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=402.88s)]
*  Yesterday, during the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee hearing, many of us questioned [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=405.8s)]
*  Secretary Austin about the decision made secretly over the weekend without consultation with [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=412.96000000000004s)]
*  Congress. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=421.96000000000004s)]
*  He said that it was not a final decision. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=423.24s)]
*  If you pause, if you halt the delivery of weapons systems that Israel needs to defend [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=428.46000000000004s)]
*  itself and to win the war against a terrorist group that is dedicated to its destruction, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=437.28000000000003s)]
*  that is a decision. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=447.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=450.6s)]
*  Senator Rich. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=451.6s)]
*  Well, thank you very much. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=452.6s)]
*  I put out a press release on this a little earlier today, which has a lot more detail [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=454.96000000000004s)]
*  than what I'm going to say, and it's going to be brief. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=458.56s)]
*  Look, the nonpartisan weapons sales process has kept domestic political squabbles out [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=461.4s)]
*  of this for a long, long time. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=468.03999999999996s)]
*  It's been in place for about a half a century, and it has worked really, really well. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=471.2s)]
*  The administration has stepped outside those boundaries now with what they're doing here [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=476.64s)]
*  without any notifications to us. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=482.79999999999995s)]
*  Look, we have a situation here where the Congress passed funding, the administration allowed [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=485.32s)]
*  these weapons sales, myself and the other three members of Congress who closely look [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=492.64s)]
*  at these sales and take that obligation seriously all signed off on it, and now in the heat [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=498.2s)]
*  of battle this administration is saying, we're going to pull this back. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=503.71999999999997s)]
*  This is unprecedented. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=508.74s)]
*  It's going to be watched by our enemies. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=510.2s)]
*  It's going to be watched by our allies, and it is not helpful to the national security [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=511.78s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=516.62s)]
*  More importantly, what the administration claims to be trying to do is to reduce the [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=518.22s)]
*  collateral damages when Israel goes into Ra'afah, and they are going into Ra'afah. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=523.6s)]
*  They've said they're going in with or without anybody else's help. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=529.38s)]
*  What is the system that they've held up? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=533.6999999999999s)]
*  It's the kits that make the bombs smart bombs and precision bombs instead of general bombs. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=535.86s)]
*  They're doing exactly the opposite of what they say they're trying to do. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=541.38s)]
*  This is simply a nod to their far left flank. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=546.14s)]
*  It's trying to have a foot on each side of the fence, which it can do. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=549.02s)]
*  Within two hours of the president's announcement last night, Hamas said they were withdrawing [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=553.14s)]
*  from negotiations on hostages and on a ceasefire. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=559.66s)]
*  What the president has done is handed a great victory to Mahas here. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=563.98s)]
*  It's going to invigorate the fighting that they're doing in Gaza, and it's going to [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=567.28s)]
*  stop the negotiations that have been ongoing. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=571.52s)]
*  This was a horrible mistake. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=575.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=576.4s)]
*  Well, what have I learned? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=577.4s)]
*  It took Hamas two hours to withdraw. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=580.24s)]
*  It means they have bad internet, because I think they would have withdrawn the moment [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=583.12s)]
*  they heard. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=588.4399999999999s)]
*  We have several other speakers, but I just want to emphasize one thing. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=589.8199999999999s)]
*  This is all about President Biden and Lord Austin trying to take over the war from Israel. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=593.76s)]
*  I got one message for Israel. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=603.2s)]
*  Don't let them do it. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=607.8s)]
*  Joni. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=610.4399999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=611.4399999999999s)]
*  Yes, thanks everybody for coming out today. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=612.4399999999999s)]
*  And Lindsay, thank you for your leadership on this. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=615.04s)]
*  And I just returned from Israel on Tuesday morning. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=618.8399999999999s)]
*  Senator Ted Butt and I had traveled through the region, through the Middle East, and over [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=623.9599999999999s)]
*  and over we heard from regional leadership about how important it is for America to step [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=629.02s)]
*  up their leadership. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=637.8399999999999s)]
*  There's a void of leadership in the White House today. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=640.4s)]
*  And if anything, there's no leadership but in place of that appeasement. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=645.6800000000001s)]
*  And we see Joe Biden doing that. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=651.92s)]
*  So what we saw and what we heard while we were traveling through the Middle East is [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=654.12s)]
*  that our service members, our service members are under attack. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=658.24s)]
*  They're under attack from Iran, from Iranian proxies throughout the Middle East. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=665.28s)]
*  And our citizens are being held captive by Hamas. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=672.48s)]
*  We cannot forget that there were over 40 Americans killed on October 7th in the attack perpetrated [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=676.44s)]
*  by Hamas when they went into Israel. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=686.66s)]
*  We have eight Americans that are being held by Hamas, three of whom we know are deceased. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=690.74s)]
*  They're alive, God willing, are still alive. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=701.68s)]
*  The last thing that we need is a president who waffles on his support to Israel. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=705.52s)]
*  So much for that ironclad support, his words, not mine, Joe Biden's ironclad support of [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=712.3199999999999s)]
*  Israel. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=722.24s)]
*  Folks, he's lying to Israel and he's lying to all of you. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=723.24s)]
*  It is not ironclad. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=730.64s)]
*  He is withholding weapons that are needed by our closest friend and ally in the Middle [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=732.12s)]
*  East, Israel. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=736.88s)]
*  We already have these mouthpieces for Hamas here at home. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=739.08s)]
*  We've seen them all on these liberal campuses out there supporting and saying they are Hamas, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=742.8000000000001s)]
*  our own students at liberal elite colleges. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=750.76s)]
*  We don't need the president stepping into that arena as well. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=754.48s)]
*  The president is a tool, folks. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=760.04s)]
*  He is a tool. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=763.1199999999999s)]
*  Okay, in this case, he's a propaganda tool. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=764.1199999999999s)]
*  But Hamas is using him and he is allowing it and he is turning his back on Israel. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=768.04s)]
*  So our message today should be to remember Mr. President, Hamas created the humanitarian [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=775.56s)]
*  disaster in Gaza. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=783.52s)]
*  Hamas knew exactly what would happen when they attacked on October 7th. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=785.6s)]
*  They knew that Israel would respond and that they would strive for victory and the destruction [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=790.72s)]
*  of Hamas. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=797.12s)]
*  They knew that this is not Israel's fault. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=798.78s)]
*  This is Hamas's fault. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=802.92s)]
*  This is Sinwar's fault. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=804.84s)]
*  This is Iran's fault. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=806.56s)]
*  It is not Israel's fault. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=809.3199999999999s)]
*  So we don't need Joe Biden being a mouthpiece for Hamas. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=811.78s)]
*  We certainly don't need it in our White House. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=817.0s)]
*  We need new leadership. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=819.98s)]
*  The national security policy of Joe Biden and the Democrats is precisely backwards. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=829.74s)]
*  For three and a half years, Joe Biden and the Democrats have undermined and weakened [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=835.5799999999999s)]
*  our friends and allies and they have sent billions of dollars to our enemies. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=840.3s)]
*  It is exactly opposite what you would be doing if you were actually focused on U.S. national [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=846.78s)]
*  security interests. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=852.58s)]
*  Let's look at our enemies. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=855.62s)]
*  Tragically, Joe Biden has been the greatest friend the Ayatollah Khomeini has ever had [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=857.9s)]
*  on planet Earth. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=864.3s)]
*  Tragically, Joe Biden has been the greatest friend to Hamas and Hezbollah that there is [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=867.0200000000001s)]
*  on planet Earth. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=874.22s)]
*  Now those sound like extraordinary statements. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=875.22s)]
*  What are the facts? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=878.74s)]
*  Under the Biden presidency, this administration has flowed more than $100 billion into Iran. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=881.7s)]
*  $6 billion in ransom for five Americans, a policy which many of us said at the time would [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=891.5s)]
*  only lead to more Americans being taken hostage and we saw tragically on October 7th that [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=897.5799999999999s)]
*  proved exactly right. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=902.78s)]
*  $10 billion in funds in Iraq that the Biden administration wanted to flow to the Ayatollah [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=904.62s)]
*  and then over $80 billion in oil. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=910.62s)]
*  When Joe Biden came into office, the Trump administration with the active support of [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=916.94s)]
*  all of us had vigorously imposed oil sanctions and had cut Iran's oil exports from 1 million [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=921.0600000000001s)]
*  barrels a day down to about 300,000. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=928.62s)]
*  The Iranian economy was in shambles. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=931.58s)]
*  The Ayatollah was on his knees. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=933.88s)]
*  Joe Biden came in like the cavalry coming to the rescue and immediately stopped enforcing [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=936.82s)]
*  oil sanctions. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=944.26s)]
*  And what happened? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=945.78s)]
*  Iran's oil sales went from 300,000 barrels a day to now more than 2 million barrels a [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=946.78s)]
*  day. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=954.22s)]
*  Every one of those barrels is a gift from Joe Biden and the Democrats. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=956.48s)]
*  That is over $80 billion. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=960.42s)]
*  Mind you, this is from the same administration that does everything they can to kill oil [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=965.18s)]
*  and gas production in America while allowing a theocratic Ayatollah. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=970.7s)]
*  Understand the Ayatollah chants with mobs chants death to America and death to Israel [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=976.4200000000001s)]
*  and Joe Biden has said here's $100 billion. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=981.86s)]
*  This seems like a great idea. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=984.82s)]
*  And what happened with that $100 billion? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=987.8000000000001s)]
*  Well, 90% of Hamas' funding comes from Iran. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=990.66s)]
*  90% of Hezbollah's funding comes from Iran. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=995.6600000000001s)]
*  October 7th was in a very real way funded by money given by Joe Biden and the Democrats [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=999.7800000000001s)]
*  to Iran and Hamas and Hezbollah. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1006.6400000000001s)]
*  And by the way, Biden also sent hundreds of millions of dollars into Gaza, even though [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1008.9000000000001s)]
*  many of us said if you send it to Gaza, it will go to Hamas and be used for terrorism. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1013.22s)]
*  They knew that. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1018.8800000000001s)]
*  They agreed with that. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1019.8800000000001s)]
*  The Biden administration concluded it was quote, highly likely the money would go to [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1020.9399999999999s)]
*  Hamas for terrorism. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1025.14s)]
*  You know what they did? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1026.14s)]
*  They waived the anti-terrorism laws and said send it anyway. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1028.2s)]
*  Where are we now? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1033.08s)]
*  Where we are now is the Biden administration is sending money right now to Gaza. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1035.16s)]
*  Many of us said if you send the money to Gaza, it will be seized by Hamas. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1042.7s)]
*  What happened? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1046.08s)]
*  The government came in and boom, immediately seized by Hamas, exactly like we said. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1047.28s)]
*  But they're combining it with blocking weapons to Israel. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1052.84s)]
*  The Biden White House has been the most anti-Israel administration this nation has ever seen. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1058.8799999999999s)]
*  Literally from day one, the Biden White House has been undermining Israel at every step [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1065.76s)]
*  of the way. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1070.36s)]
*  When October 7th happened, when Hamas death squads were murdering 1,200 innocent civilians, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1072.44s)]
*  were raping women and little girls, while the attacks were happening, the Biden State [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1079.68s)]
*  Department sent out a tweet at 3 in the morning saying Israel must not retaliate. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1084.28s)]
*  There should be no military response. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1089.96s)]
*  That tweet was disgraceful. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1093.42s)]
*  I called it out at 3 in the morning and they deleted the tweet within minutes. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1094.56s)]
*  The next day, Tony Blinken, the Secretary of State, sent another tweet. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1099.36s)]
*  He said, I just talked with a Turkish foreign minister. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1102.8s)]
*  We agreed Israel must not retaliate, must not strike back. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1105.4799999999998s)]
*  I called that tweet out again. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1110.9199999999998s)]
*  They deleted it again. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1112.3999999999999s)]
*  Where are we today? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1114.9199999999998s)]
*  Well yesterday, Joe Biden said, quote, I made it clear if Israel goes into RAFA, I'm not [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1116.9199999999998s)]
*  supplying the weapons. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1122.28s)]
*  We're not going to supply the weapons and the artillery shells. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1124.82s)]
*  I will point out Joe Biden and the Democrats lied to the American people on the supplemental [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1127.68s)]
*  funding bill that was just voted. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1132.52s)]
*  They claimed it was to provide military funding to Israel. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1135.48s)]
*  We now know they were lying. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1138.8400000000001s)]
*  It was instead to give money to Gaza and Hamas and everywhere else except Israel. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1142.68s)]
*  We should have sent this military aid six months ago. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1150.54s)]
*  Many of us went to the Senate floor to force a vote on emergency military aid in November, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1155.28s)]
*  right after October 7th. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1160.36s)]
*  Every single Democrat voted no. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1162.28s)]
*  It was a straight party line vote. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1164.08s)]
*  A final observation. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1167.08s)]
*  What Joe Biden is doing is not new. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1170.04s)]
*  He has spent decades attacking and undermining Israel. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1173.76s)]
*  Yes, it is true the radical left wing of the Democrat Party, the pro-Hamas wing of the [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1180.0s)]
*  Democrat Party is on the rise, is on campuses, and the Democrats are terrified of him. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1184.68s)]
*  All of that is true. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1189.1200000000001s)]
*  Yes, it is true. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1190.1200000000001s)]
*  They're terrified they're going to lose Michigan unless they give in to the pro-Hamas wing [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1192.2s)]
*  of the Democrat Party. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1197.0400000000002s)]
*  But understand these sentiments are not new for Joe Biden. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1199.64s)]
*  In 1982, when by the way I was 11 years old, in 1982 Joe Biden was a Senator from Delaware [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1203.0800000000002s)]
*  and he confronted Israel's Prime Minister Menachem Begin during his Senate Foreign Relations [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1213.0400000000002s)]
*  Committee testimony. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1219.3000000000002s)]
*  And you know what Joe Biden was doing in 1982? [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1221.3000000000002s)]
*  Same damn thing he's doing in 2024. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1224.8400000000001s)]
*  He threatened to cut off aid to Israel in 1982. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1226.96s)]
*  And Prime Minister Begin responded as follows, quote, don't threaten us with cutting off [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1232.68s)]
*  your aid. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1239.24s)]
*  It will not work. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1240.92s)]
*  I am not a Jew with trembling knees. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1243.38s)]
*  I am a proud Jew with 3,700 years of civilized history. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1247.28s)]
*  Nobody came to our aid when we were dying in the gas chambers and ovens. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1253.0800000000002s)]
*  Nobody came to our aid when we were striving to create our country. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1258.88s)]
*  We paid for it. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1263.44s)]
*  We fought for it. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1265.2800000000002s)]
*  We died for it. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1267.0200000000002s)]
*  We will stand by our principles. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1269.2800000000002s)]
*  We will defend them. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1272.3200000000002s)]
*  And when necessary, we will die for them again with or without your aid. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1274.42s)]
*  Even though Joe Biden wants to abandon Israel, and even though the Democrats in the Senate [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1283.52s)]
*  and House apparently support him in wanting to abandon Israel, America does not and we [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1290.0s)]
*  should not let him. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1296.08s)]
*  We should stand together and say America stands united with Israel and Hamas should be utterly [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1298.04s)]
*  destroyed. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1306.36s)]
*  Roger. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1307.36s)]
*  All right. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1308.36s)]
*  Amen. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1309.36s)]
*  Damn, he's good. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1310.36s)]
*  He's going to pass the plate. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1312.1999999999998s)]
*  He is really good. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1314.9599999999998s)]
*  Senator Cruz, what that reminds me of is I keep calling Joe Biden's national security [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1318.9599999999998s)]
*  policy his schizophrenic national security policy and you hit on a lot of the points. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1322.6799999999998s)]
*  Senator Graham, I'm honored to stand in this foxhole with you. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1329.76s)]
*  I've never been more honored to stand with these group of soldiers here fighting for [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1332.4399999999998s)]
*  the safety and well-being of Israel. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1336.6399999999999s)]
*  No, I've often said don't watch or I've often said watch what Joe Biden and the Democrats [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1340.36s)]
*  do. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1346.6399999999999s)]
*  Don't watch what they say. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1347.6399999999999s)]
*  Watch what they do. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1348.6399999999999s)]
*  This is Senator Schumer, November 14th in the National Ball. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1349.6399999999999s)]
*  I quote him, we will not rest until you get all the assistance you need. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1353.6s)]
*  We will not rest until you get all the assistance you need. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1358.4799999999998s)]
*  Several hours later, we had a vote where they tabled standalone funding for Israel. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1361.24s)]
*  As a matter of fact, six times the Democrats have voted against standalone funding for [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1365.68s)]
*  Israel. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1369.8400000000001s)]
*  I would ask Leader Schumer, where's his outrage today? [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1371.3200000000002s)]
*  If he sits here and says that he would not rest until Israel gets the help they need, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1374.2s)]
*  where is his outrage today? [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1379.2s)]
*  April 17th, Wall Street Journal, Joe Biden, and I quote him, now is not the time to abandon [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1382.6000000000001s)]
*  our friends. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1389.3600000000001s)]
*  The House must pass urgent national security legislation for Ukraine and Israel. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1390.6000000000001s)]
*  So April 14th, the President of the United States is saying this is urgent. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1395.6s)]
*  This week, as several people have referenced, on Holocaust Remembrance Day, Joe Biden said [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1400.3999999999999s)]
*  never again. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1404.56s)]
*  Never again to the Holocaust survivors and Jewish Americans. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1406.24s)]
*  Here he is saying one thing, but he does another. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1409.48s)]
*  His words are empty. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1412.0s)]
*  This is why he has no respect on the world stage. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1413.3999999999999s)]
*  He now holds aid up to Israel with zero transparency and zero communication to Congress. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1419.0s)]
*  I want to just talk a second about Joe Biden's schizophrenic foreign policy. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1425.52s)]
*  This is what makes him so very weak and why our enemies don't fear us and our allies don't [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1431.32s)]
*  respect us anymore because he has a schizophrenic policy. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1438.16s)]
*  He says he wants to help Israel, but he's bowing knee to a handful of votes in Michigan. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1441.9s)]
*  He can't thread this needle. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1448.16s)]
*  He's putting political aspirations ahead of sound national security policy. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1449.52s)]
*  That's why it seems schizophrenic to me and to many Americans as well. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1454.52s)]
*  At the end of the day, we don't know where Joe Biden stands. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1460.0s)]
*  I don't know where he stands on this issue. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1463.16s)]
*  He says one thing, he does another. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1464.92s)]
*  Does he stand with Israel or does he stand with Hamas? [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1467.96s)]
*  Does he stand with the anti-American protesters rioting across American's college campuses? [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1471.7s)]
*  All of his actions are saying that he stands with Hamas. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1478.1599999999999s)]
*  Again, I'm honored to be up here today and I just want our friends in Israel to know [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1481.76s)]
*  as for me and my family, we're standing with Israel. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1486.4399999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1489.6799999999998s)]
*  There are only 49 of us, so there'll be an end to this. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1490.6799999999998s)]
*  Well, welcome to Joe Biden's America. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1496.36s)]
*  Tuesday morning, I left beautiful big sky country in Montana and flew back to Washington, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1499.4799999999998s)]
*  D.C. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1504.28s)]
*  I landed at DCA. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1505.28s)]
*  My staff picked me up and we're on our way to see George Washington University. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1506.84s)]
*  I walked on that campus. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1513.1999999999998s)]
*  I stood in front of the statue of George Washington. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1515.6799999999998s)]
*  The statue of the founder of our country was wrapped in a Palestinian flag. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1519.6s)]
*  His head was wrapped in the kaffir, the black and white checkered scarf. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1526.9199999999998s)]
*  Vandalized the bottom in red spray paint. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1534.3200000000002s)]
*  It said genocide. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1536.0800000000002s)]
*  And then there was a whiteboard leaned up against the bottom of the statue. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1538.64s)]
*  Now keep in mind, this is ground zero of the pro-Hamas encampment. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1543.44s)]
*  So as I'm looking at the statue of George Washington, I'm seeing tents as far as you [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1548.16s)]
*  can see with this pro-Hamas encampment. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1553.8400000000001s)]
*  And on that whiteboard, it said, no Zionism. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1558.32s)]
*  Later that day, and by the way, when I was on campus, I chatted with some of the Jewish [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1566.96s)]
*  students, one of the rabbis there, as they are afraid to even walk on their campus. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1572.04s)]
*  Yet later that night, these pro-Hamas protesters went to the university administrators and [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1578.28s)]
*  the president's home and called for the beheading of some of the administrators and leaders [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1586.16s)]
*  at GW. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1592.0s)]
*  I didn't think I'd live to see the day of this going on in our university campuses. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1594.8400000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden did nothing. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1600.3600000000001s)]
*  And then the lethal aid that Joe Biden said he wanted to provide Israel, it's now on [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1602.8600000000001s)]
*  hold. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1608.6000000000001s)]
*  Why is it on hold? [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1609.6000000000001s)]
*  To appease his liberal base in places like Dearborn, Michigan, because Joe Biden's in [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1610.9s)]
*  trouble in Michigan. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1616.88s)]
*  This is not going to help Israel win the war. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1620.38s)]
*  It's not going to help to get our hostages home. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1623.48s)]
*  Mr. President, Afghanistan was bad enough. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1626.6200000000001s)]
*  Now you're going to leave more Americans stranded and in the hands of terrorists. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1630.44s)]
*  Every single Democrat should be standing with us at this moment, condemning the president's [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1637.46s)]
*  remarks and pleading with him, demanding he reverse his course. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1642.76s)]
*  The choice is very simple. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1647.0s)]
*  There's a moment of moral clarity needed in American history at this moment, at this hour. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1648.9s)]
*  It's simply this. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1654.74s)]
*  You are either for Israel or you're for Iran and their desire to exterminate Israel and [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1655.96s)]
*  Jews around the world. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1664.48s)]
*  Ted, but Katie and me want to take questions. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1666.48s)]
*  Senator Graham, thanks for hosting this, for your leadership on this issue and around the [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1672.48s)]
*  world. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1676.1200000000001s)]
*  I just returned from a congressional delegation trip with Senator Ernst to the Middle East. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1677.1200000000001s)]
*  And while we were there, we met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1682.92s)]
*  We discussed the situation about hostages and their military operations in Gaza. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1686.26s)]
*  After everything we heard, we know that President Biden's decision to withhold critical ammunition [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1692.28s)]
*  to Israel, it's a total betrayal of our friend and our ally. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1697.22s)]
*  Israel's in a existential fight for survival against genocidal Hamas terrorists. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1703.52s)]
*  And those same Hamas terrorists currently hold eight American citizens, including North [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1708.54s)]
*  Carolina native, Keith Siegel. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1713.6399999999999s)]
*  The best way that we can bring them home, it's by increasing pressure on Hamas. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1717.44s)]
*  But by withholding lethal aid, President Biden is signaling to Hamas that it's okay to hold [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1723.3200000000002s)]
*  out and to continue their campaign of terror. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1728.22s)]
*  So the bottom line is this, President Biden is making it harder to bring these hostages [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1731.5800000000002s)]
*  home. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1736.16s)]
*  And the ultimate absurdity of this decision by President Biden is that the administration [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1737.16s)]
*  is withholding precision guided munitions. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1742.3200000000002s)]
*  Senator Risch spoke about this earlier, because the Biden administration is actually making [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1745.64s)]
*  civilian casualties more likely. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1750.0s)]
*  But at the end of the day, we know what all of this is about. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1753.1200000000001s)]
*  For President Biden, this is about November elections. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1757.92s)]
*  And I know firsthand that President Biden is overruling his own national security team, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1760.64s)]
*  and he's letting a few radical activists on his staff dictate our foreign policy. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1767.0200000000002s)]
*  He's just too weak to say no. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1772.48s)]
*  President Biden is putting politics over our friends and allies, the Jewish people, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1775.52s)]
*  and our friends, the American hostages. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1780.8s)]
*  This is one of the most shameful displays we've ever seen from a U.S. president. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1783.48s)]
*  It telegraphs to the world that the U.S. is not to be trusted. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1788.4s)]
*  We deserve better. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1793.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1798.96s)]
*  I want to start by thanking Senator Graham for leadership on this and so many important [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1799.96s)]
*  issues. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1803.0s)]
*  You know, as I stand here listening to all of my colleagues make such incredible points [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1804.2s)]
*  that somehow this administration continues to miss, I can't help but think they also [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1810.52s)]
*  continue to miss the opportunity to learn from history. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1815.72s)]
*  As we heard Senator Daines talk about what's happening on our college campuses, talking [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1819.6s)]
*  about the lack of enforcement of Title VI, this administration refusing to protect our [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1823.6s)]
*  Jewish brothers and sisters as they want to go to class, they want to eat peacefully [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1828.16s)]
*  in dining halls, be okay in their dorms. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1831.56s)]
*  I remember that discrimination upon race, denigrating someone upon race, blocking someone [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1835.48s)]
*  from a classroom wasn't okay in the 1960s. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1842.44s)]
*  Do you hear me? [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1846.32s)]
*  And it is not okay today. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1847.9199999999998s)]
*  This administration needs to stand up and stand against anti-Semitism. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1851.52s)]
*  What else they're failing to learn from? [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1857.04s)]
*  I mean, yesterday we celebrated 79 years since VE Day, the victory there in Europe, liberating [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1859.96s)]
*  Europe from Nazi terror. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1867.36s)]
*  Earlier this week, we honored those 6 million Jews that died in the Holocaust. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1870.36s)]
*  You heard a place in this country, a Harvard-Harris poll just came out, where it said between [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1877.0s)]
*  the ages of 18 and 29, one in five of those individuals don't believe the Holocaust even [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1880.76s)]
*  existed. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1887.8s)]
*  And on that note, I think it's important that we continue to tell the story of October 7th, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1889.96s)]
*  because somehow that has gotten lost. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1894.2s)]
*  Senator Graham led a delegation to Israel. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1896.76s)]
*  We sat across from Israeli leaders. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1899.8799999999999s)]
*  We watched the footage, the horrifying footage of those Hamas terrorists with the GoPro cameras [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1902.6s)]
*  strapped to their heads and their chest. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1910.76s)]
*  When we talked to the Israeli officials, we mentioned 9-11, and they said, yes, it's similar, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1914.24s)]
*  but I want you to understand why it's different. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1920.2s)]
*  You were able to wake up on September 12th and tell your kids that the perpetrator was [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1922.64s)]
*  oceans away. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1929.1200000000001s)]
*  We woke up on October 8th, and the people who want to eradicate this entire population [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1931.24s)]
*  are just miles down the road. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1937.52s)]
*  I want you to think of what we're asking for parents in Israel who are tucking their [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1939.6s)]
*  children in at night, these disgusting, barbaric terrorists. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1944.04s)]
*  They're not going after soldiers. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1949.1599999999999s)]
*  They're coming after babies and beheading them. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1951.52s)]
*  We watch them rape women. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1955.04s)]
*  We watch them pull Holocaust survivors from their wheelchair. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1956.8s)]
*  We watch them burn parents alive in front of their children. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1960.8s)]
*  This is what we are up against. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1964.36s)]
*  You cannot in good conscience ask parents to tuck their kids at night without believing [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1966.32s)]
*  that Israel can move forward and eradicate Hamas. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1972.92s)]
*  There are still four battalions in Ra'a. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1976.96s)]
*  So understand what that means for the innocent people of Israel. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1981.08s)]
*  We must do more. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1986.6s)]
*  Never again is now. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1987.8s)]
*  And I urge the President of the United States to not be the very first president to not [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1990.12s)]
*  stand with Israel. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1995.24s)]
*  They are our greatest ally, and they deserve us to stand shoulder to shoulder with them [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=1996.68s)]
*  as they fight the evil that is Hamas. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2001.16s)]
*  Well, thank you all. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2003.96s)]
*  So real, real quick, let's just build up where Mr. President reconsider this. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2006.3200000000002s)]
*  It's OK to reconsider and change your mind when circumstance warms. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2012.0800000000002s)]
*  For over a year, I have been working with the Biden administration and many of my colleagues [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2016.72s)]
*  up here to try to have an agreement between Saudi Arabia and Israel that would end the [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2021.5600000000002s)]
*  Arab-Israeli conflict on President Biden's watch. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2028.68s)]
*  I believe a Democratic president is best positioned to build on the Abraham Accords when it comes [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2033.0s)]
*  to Saudi Arabia and Israel. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2038.5200000000002s)]
*  That would be a major accomplishment. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2040.24s)]
*  I think President Trump understands he would get his fair share of credit. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2042.76s)]
*  I have been to Saudi Arabia and Israel five times since the war. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2046.64s)]
*  The goal is to try to bring Saudi and Israel to the table to conclude a deal that would [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2051.96s)]
*  end the Arab-Israeli conflict, isolate Iran, and find a better, hopeful future for the [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2058.16s)]
*  Palestinians through direct negotiations with Israelis. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2064.12s)]
*  I am still committed to that. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2068.2799999999997s)]
*  Mr. President, if you do not change this policy, you will have destroyed the last best chance [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2070.56s)]
*  to deliver lasting stability in the Mideast for generations. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2076.68s)]
*  Saudi Arabia is watching. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2082.3199999999997s)]
*  Would you, as a nation, sign a defense agreement with the United States, knowing what we have [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2084.84s)]
*  just done to Israel? [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2090.5600000000004s)]
*  Is signing on the dotted line with the United States in a mutual defense agreement equivalent [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2093.44s)]
*  to outsourcing your national security to the United States? [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2098.36s)]
*  That is the message you are sending. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2103.0400000000004s)]
*  Israel is being asked to turn the war fighting over to the United States. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2105.6400000000003s)]
*  Let us plan how to do this, not you. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2110.36s)]
*  That is a huge mistake. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2114.8s)]
*  Number one, I trust Israel more than I trust Austin. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2116.1600000000003s)]
*  He still said Afghanistan withdrawal was a good idea. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2119.44s)]
*  Bottom line, there is a lot at stake here. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2123.44s)]
*  I think the region and the world is going to second-guess future relationships with [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2125.76s)]
*  us, Mr. President, if you do not change your mind. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2130.4s)]
*  Finally, is it right to give bombs to Israel in these circumstances? [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2133.64s)]
*  I think the answer is yes. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2140.88s)]
*  I want to define the problem Israel faces. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2143.48s)]
*  Hezbollah is a terrorist organization that has over 100,000 weapons pointed at Israel. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2147.08s)]
*  They are Shiites. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2154.0s)]
*  They are in Lebanon. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2155.0s)]
*  They actively attack Israel regularly. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2156.52s)]
*  Hamas is a terrorist organization that is dedicated to the destruction of the Jewish [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2161.88s)]
*  state, not helping the Palestinians. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2169.6000000000004s)]
*  Their charter is not to bring about a better life for the Palestinians, but to destroy [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2172.76s)]
*  from the river to the sea all the Jews. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2177.36s)]
*  This is what they said after October the 7th. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2180.44s)]
*  We are not ashamed to say this with full force. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2184.2400000000002s)]
*  We must teach Israel a lesson and we will do this again, again, and again. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2187.92s)]
*  This is the spokesperson of Hamas after October 7th telling Israel we are coming for you again, [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2193.48s)]
*  again, and again. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2200.08s)]
*  Now, what is the proportional response to that? [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2201.08s)]
*  I want you to ask every Democrat and Republican, were you okay with using two nuclear bombs [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2206.12s)]
*  against Japan to end the war? [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2212.76s)]
*  Was that proportional? [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2215.0s)]
*  Were you okay with the firebombing of Dresden to break the backs of the Nazis? [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2216.84s)]
*  What is the right response to a group that rapes your women, puts your babies in an oven, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2222.56s)]
*  and threatens to do it again? [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2230.32s)]
*  Drop bombs if you have to. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2232.76s)]
*  So, you've got Hamas, you've got Hezbollah, and the biggest Satan of all is Iran. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2234.6400000000003s)]
*  In one week, Israel was attacked by Hezbollah, Hamas, and Iran. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2243.32s)]
*  300 rockets and missiles launched from Iranian territory to the state of Israel. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2248.76s)]
*  In one week, what is the proper response to three organizations dedicated to killing all [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2255.6000000000004s)]
*  the Jews if you're a Jew? [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2263.28s)]
*  What's the proper response 80 years after the Holocaust to make sure you don't have [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2266.84s)]
*  the second Holocaust? [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2272.16s)]
*  The fight! [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2273.72s)]
*  The fight with all your might! [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2275.7599999999998s)]
*  And here's what I want to say about the IDF. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2277.3199999999997s)]
*  I've been there like all my colleagues. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2279.92s)]
*  They're doing their best to restrict civilian casualties, I think. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2281.92s)]
*  Here's the enemy. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2287.52s)]
*  They're doing their best to make sure Israel kills as many Palestinians as possible. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2289.08s)]
*  They have command headquarters under a hospital. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2295.52s)]

*  Withholding weapons makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to get American hostages [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2346.3399999999997s)]
*  back and Israeli hostages back because you're incentivizing bad behavior. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2352.22s)]
*  Withholding weapons makes Iran stronger, not weaker. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2358.06s)]
*  Withholding weapons in the most just war since World War II makes Saudi Arabia more doubtful. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2363.06s)]
*  The consequences of this decision, Mr. President, are going to change the region and the world [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2370.66s)]
*  for all the worse. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2375.86s)]

*  How they do it is subject to negotiation. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2393.94s)]
*  But what I fear is this decision to withhold weapons has made the likelihood of going in [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2397.54s)]
*  Ra'aafa greater, not less. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2403.62s)]

*  Mr. President, if you can summon the courage to say we're going to give Israel the weapons [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2416.94s)]
*  they need, I think we can get the Saudi Israel deal back on track. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2425.58s)]
*  I think you'll have all the critics up here behind you applauding. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2430.78s)]
*  And what do we want? [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2434.52s)]
*  We want Israel to survive and thrive. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2436.62s)]
*  We want Hamas destroyed. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2439.26s)]
*  We want the Palestinians to have a better future. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2441.38s)]
*  That only happens when you're unequivocal. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2444.62s)]
*  Now is the time, Mr. President, to send a message to all the bad guys. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2449.5s)]
*  We're with Israel. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2457.22s)]
*  Now is the time, Mr. President, to reinforce all the rhetoric you've been saying for the [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2458.22s)]
*  last six months. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2463.7799999999997s)]

*  Our nation felt it was appropriate to drop nuclear bombs on two cities to end a war we [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2474.42s)]
*  could not afford to lose. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2484.1800000000003s)]
*  I believe it's appropriate for Israel to have the weapons to destroy Hamas to make sure [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2486.86s)]
*  we never have to do this again. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2493.66s)]
*  Here's what Bibi said. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2496.1800000000003s)]
*  Never again is now. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2498.9s)]
*  Is it your position that there is no one lying when it comes to Israel's war with Hamas? [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2502.9s)]
*  My position is that Israel is fighting a just war. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2509.78s)]
*  They're conducting themselves within the law of armed conflict. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2514.38s)]
*  That Hamas is turning the law of armed conflict upside down. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2517.9s)]
*  That the civilian casualties are mainly due in terms of numbers to Hamas's tactics. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2521.64s)]
*  That I'm not going to second-guess Israel. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2527.12s)]
*  I'm going to give them the weapons they need. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2528.78s)]
*  Israel's not the problem. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2531.42s)]
*  What would we do? [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2532.94s)]
*  What did we do? [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2534.14s)]
*  We dropped two nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2535.14s)]
*  Should we have done that? [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2537.9s)]
*  Yeah, I think we should. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2538.9s)]
*  We saved a million Americans from having to go and invade Japan. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2539.9s)]
*  So no, Israel's tactics are not my problem. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2543.06s)]
*  My problem is the equivocation by this administration to allow them to get on with doing this. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2546.54s)]
*  No. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2552.1800000000003s)]
*  Because I don't see a problem. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2556.14s)]
*  If you want the hostages back, you've made it harder to get them back because there's [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2561.42s)]
*  daylight between the United States and Israel. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2569.82s)]
*  Senwar is feeling pretty good right now. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2574.94s)]
*  The reason they're not dancing Iran, they just don't dance. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2576.66s)]
*  So here's the implications immediately. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2579.94s)]
*  The hostage deal becomes harder to do. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2582.54s)]
*  The implications longer range is that the deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel is less [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2584.94s)]
*  likely if Saudi Arabia believes we're going to take over and manage their national security [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2590.18s)]
*  by signing up with us. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2594.58s)]
*  So I think the implications of Iran taking this as a sign of weakness get stronger. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2596.38s)]
*  I think the desire of Israel to destroy Hamas is non-negotiable and you're putting Israel [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2602.38s)]
*  in a bad spot. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2608.02s)]
*  I am hoping it doesn't get derailed, but here's what you have to ask yourself. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2618.62s)]
*  If you're Saudi Arabia, knowing what they're doing to Israel, would you sign on the dotted [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2622.62s)]
*  line? [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2627.54s)]
*  Knowing that they may come a day when you're in a fight for your life against maybe the [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2629.1s)]
*  Houthis or the Iranians and all of a sudden we show up saying, no, you can't do this, [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2633.58s)]
*  you can't do that. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2638.8199999999997s)]
*  All I can say, folks, if somebody had told us you're doing too much to destroy Germany [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2640.18s)]
*  and Japan after what they did, it would have fallen on deaf ears. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2648.2599999999998s)]
*  Israel's trying to lower civilian casualties. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2654.58s)]
*  Hamas is trying to increase civilian casualties. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2658.06s)]
*  Therein lies our problem. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2661.14s)]
*  Given that there have been thousands of civilians that have died, do you think there should [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2662.14s)]
*  be no lever at all for the administration to try to prevent American weapons being used [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2663.14s)]
*  in the past that even unintentionally end up killing civilians? [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2664.14s)]
*  I think that's a good question. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2665.14s)]
*  I think that's a good question. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2666.14s)]
*  I think that's a good question. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2667.14s)]
*  I think that's a good question. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2668.14s)]
*  I think that's a good question. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2669.14s)]
*  I think that's a good question. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2670.14s)]
*  I think that's a good question. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2671.14s)]
*  I think that's a good question. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2672.14s)]
*  I think that's a good question. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2673.14s)]
*  I think that's a good question. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2674.14s)]
*  I think that's a good question. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2675.14s)]
*  I think that's a good question. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2676.14s)]
*  I think Israel is in a fight for its life. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2678.14s)]
*  That the reason so many Palestinians have been killed is because Hamas has command centers [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2682.62s)]
*  under hospitals. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2689.3799999999997s)]
*  Hamas uses the Palestinian people as human shields. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2690.98s)]
*  Don't reward their behavior. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2695.0s)]
*  What you're doing is you're saying Hamas has put Palestinians in the crosshairs of [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2697.1s)]
*  Israel, so stand Israel down? [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2702.3799999999997s)]
*  That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard of. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2705.2999999999997s)]
*  I've ever heard in my friggin life is that you tell the person who's about to be wiped off the map [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2706.3s)]
*  You got to slow down because your enemy is making it hard on the Palestinian people to survive [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2711.98s)]
*  Because they choose to put them in arms away. That is ass backwards [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2717.82s)]
*  The blood of every person dying is on is on Hamas's hands [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2724.7000000000003s)]
*  And I think to Lindsay's point is that Israel has done everything they can to minimize [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2730.5s)]
*  collateral damage and civilians dying even recently, you know trying to get people out of [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2737.1800000000003s)]
*  Arafah and moving them to out of harm's way as well [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2743.02s)]
*  But what type of a soldier or warrior hides behind women and children come out and fight? [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2745.88s)]
*  And one thing I also want to add Lindsay is Hamas and Iran just don't want death to Jews [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2751.9s)]
*  They want death to Americans, too [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2757.7000000000003s)]
*  Well, and then and let me add a couple of things [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2762.78s)]
*  There are a series of questions saying like the opening question should America draw a red line [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2766.3s)]
*  The premises of all of these questions are wrong [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2772.34s)]
*  Israel does not want to kill even a single civilian [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2776.78s)]
*  Israel's objective is clear and unequivocal it is to protect the nation of Israel to protect the lives of Israelis and [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2781.02s)]
*  It is to defeat Hamas to kill [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2789.1000000000004s)]
*  terrorists [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2792.3s)]
*  Who want to murder every Jew on the planet? [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2793.82s)]
*  All of the questions doesn't the Biden administration need to step in and stop the Israelis no [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2798.3s)]
*  Their objective is to kill zero civilians and there is no military on the face of the earth that does more [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2806.78s)]
*  To protect civilians to avoid civilian casualties [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2813.98s)]
*  Then the Israeli military they do things like if they're gonna drop a bomb if they have intelligence that Hamas territory [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2817.7000000000003s)]
*  building [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2823.98s)]
*  They're gonna drop a bomb on the building. They will do something like send a dud bomb first [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2824.94s)]
*  That lands on the ceiling of the building doesn't blow up and they do that so that the civilians can get out [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2830.42s)]
*  Israel sends texts and cell phone calls to the civilians [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2837.82s)]
*  Saying we are going to attack here because Hamas is there get out leave [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2842.5s)]
*  Save yourself. You know what Hamas does Hamas says stay [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2847.7400000000002s)]

*  October 7th Hamas did not launch a military attack on Israeli soldiers [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2890.34s)]
*  That would have been bad but it at least would have been something recognizable as war attacking soldiers of a nation [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2898.22s)]
*  Falls within the contours of warfare that was not October 7th [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2906.98s)]
*  October 7th Hamas death squads went into civilian areas of kibbutz people who are farmers they were looking for civilians and [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2912.7s)]

*  Because we have a responsibility why because they're knucklehead to insist it didn't happen [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2961.54s)]
*  And so we should be standing with Israel unequivocally you asked what are the national security implications of this [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2968.26s)]
*  America's at a greater risk today than we have been at any point in modern times [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=2976.82s)]

*  Has cashed tens of thousands of dollars if not hundreds of thousands of dollars from [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3109.16s)]

*  Then you stand with what they're funding [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3143.2799999999997s)]
*  It's a simple and basic choice [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3147.6s)]
*  What is happening on campus is happening because the Democrat base wants it to happen and [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3150.6000000000004s)]
*  What Joe Biden is doing is he's encouraging Hamas Hamas saw that statement and celebrated [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3158.32s)]
*  And you know what if you're a mosque terrorist, you know what you say keep fighting [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3163.5200000000004s)]

*  Let's keep fighting. We can kill more Israelis [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3174.4s)]
*  Final question what no no, I want to ask a final question. I want to ask a final question [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3177.68s)]
*  We got two more after he asked himself the question [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3183.68s)]
*  Why isn't there a single Democrat here I [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3187.68s)]
*  Want you to pause and ask there 51 Democrats in the United States Senate is [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3191.2000000000003s)]
*  There not one of them [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3196.0s)]
*  Who's sitting there saying wait Congress just voted [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3198.2400000000002s)]
*  They said they were voting to send billions of dollars of money to the United States Senate [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3200.8s)]
*  They said they were voting to send billions of dollars of military aid [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3205.12s)]
*  to Israel [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3208.7999999999997s)]
*  They lied by the way, some of us said at the time they're lying. They're not gonna do this [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3210.3199999999997s)]
*  They want to give money to Hamas, but they're not gonna give it to Israel. Some of us said exactly that [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3215.12s)]
*  But is there not one Democrat [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3220.7999999999997s)]
*  With the courage to stand up and say mr. President this is wrong and [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3224.7999999999997s)]
*  Between Israel and Hamas you should have the courage to know which side you stand on you should stand with Israel [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3230.6400000000003s)]
*  two more questions [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3236.7200000000003s)]
*  I think there's a yeah, there's a report coming out. I think tomorrow [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3244.5600000000004s)]
*  About that analysis. I don't know if it's coming out tomorrow night. So here's what I would say. Yeah, we have laws on the books [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3250.0s)]
*  uh, Israel is uh [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3257.1200000000003s)]
*  Well regulated military they have a judge advocate who I actually know they prosecute people [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3259.84s)]
*  Uh who violate the law of war IDF members? [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3266.0s)]
*  So what I would say is let's listen to see what the state department says but back your question [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3269.6800000000003s)]
*  What red lines did we have in world war two? [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3275.36s)]
*  apparently none [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3278.4s)]
*  What i'm trying to do [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3280.0s)]
*  Is destroy Hamas with the least amount of damage to the future [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3282.0s)]
*  They gotta go for the sake of the palestinians have to go for the future of israel [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3287.04s)]
*  They have to go the tactics being employed to destroy them [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3291.28s)]
*  Are incredibly difficult because their behavior is making it so hard [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3295.44s)]
*  The bottom line is when your enemy takes the people they represent [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3300.88s)]
*  And use them as pawns to drive up the casualty rate to hope the world turns on you [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3305.6800000000003s)]
*  You don't want to reinforce that model and i'll end with one thought that ted had [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3311.04s)]
*  If hamas surrendered tomorrow and turned the hostages loose [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3316.08s)]
*  Would israel still kill palestinians? [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3320.24s)]
*  no [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3323.36s)]
*  They would end the war because the threat to them is over. Here's the question [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3324.64s)]
*  If israel withdrew tomorrow [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3328.96s)]
*  And stopped dropping bombs with hamas still try to kill them [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3331.68s)]
*  Yes, that's what this is all about [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3335.52s)]
*  Israel is not a genocidal nation [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3338.48s)]
*  Israel has got six peace agreements [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3342.08s)]
*  with arabs [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3344.8199999999997s)]
*  Israel is entertaining trying to recognize saudi arabia the keeper of the mosque and medina and mecca [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3346.4199999999996s)]
*  They have a history of integrating themselves in the region [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3353.06s)]
*  What history does hamas have? [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3356.8199999999997s)]
*  killing palestinians who want to work with israel [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3359.22s)]
*  destroying the israeli [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3363.14s)]
*  population [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3365.44s)]
*  Driving them into the sea [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3366.66s)]
*  This is about as clear contest as i've ever seen in my entire life [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3369.06s)]
*  This is not difficult for me to figure out what to do [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3374.98s)]
*  I welcome anything that would would lessen the flow put a cap on parole [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3388.58s)]
*  Yes, senator [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3392.52s)]
*  Yes [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3404.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3405.56s)]
*  Uh, yeah, we're thinking about what what tools do we have available? [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3407.16s)]
*  So to my democratic colleagues, you could be in the same boat here [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3411.4s)]
*  I mean, you know, there is checks and balances here. There are rules or rules rules of war and there should be i've been a military [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3414.7599999999998s)]
*  Lawyer i'm not asking to abandon international law here. I'm just trying to get people to understand that the enemy here [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3421.16s)]
*  Is using uh is abusing every law in the books making it very difficult for israel [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3427.7999999999997s)]
*  And I don't want to reward that behavior by punishing the victim. You want to punish the offender not the victim [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3433.16s)]
*  So we're going to look at what tools do we have and here's the first tool I have [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3439.0s)]
*  Sit down with democrats and see if we can walk this back [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3442.92s)]
*  Yeah [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3447.72s)]
*  I [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3451.96s)]
*  I didn't come here to talk about that [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3452.92s)]
*  But given what they did to trump, I think you'd make a good argument [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3455.08s)]
*  But I didn't come here to impeach the president. I came here [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3458.6s)]
*  To let everybody know we don't agree with this decision. I don't know where our democrat friends are [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3461.96s)]
*  It's a horribly bad decision and dangerous because it does put the hostages more at risk [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3466.92s)]
*  It makes the world go on longer it emboldens iran at a time. They need to be contained [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3471.72s)]
*  And I think what it's going to do is take off the table last best chance for structural changes in the mid east [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Em6AXuEdbA&t=3476.44s)]
