# Mossad veteran: This is more like blackmail
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI)
*  Let's bring in Missad veteran Oded Elam. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=0.0s)]
*  He's live from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=2.64s)]
*  Oded, thanks for joining us. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=4.24s)]
*  Is this a deal you would do? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=5.76s)]
*  Thanks for having me, first of all. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=10.16s)]
*  And I wouldn't call it a deal, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  but it's more of sort of a blackmail. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=15.34s)]
*  But under the circumstances, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=19.0s)]
*  morality overrides the objections of the war, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=22.32s)]
*  which is to eradicate the Hamas. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=28.04s)]
*  So this is more or less the same deal [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=31.44s)]
*  that was on the table [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  in the beginning of the invasion into Gaza, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=37.56s)]
*  with a few changes and a little bit flexibility [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=42.2s)]
*  of both sides. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=45.84s)]
*  But it's basically, it's more or less the same deal. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=47.24s)]
*  It's just worth pointing out [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=52.24s)]
*  that there's an explosion on the right, it looks like. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=53.32s)]
*  I'm getting it, which goes to my next point, Oded. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  Sinwar is on the ropes right now. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=59.6s)]
*  We know Israeli Special Forces [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=62.6s)]
*  have been hitting him hard. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=64.44s)]
*  Plus you got your infantrymen, the ground game, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=66.44s)]
*  as well as the air support. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=69.56s)]
*  So the question is, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=71.4s)]
*  did they come to the negotiation table [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=72.28s)]
*  because they're fractured [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=75.16s)]
*  and they need some time to regroup? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=76.36s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=80.24s)]
*  This is exactly the point right now. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=81.16s)]
*  The Hamas right now, as you said, is on the rope, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=84.68s)]
*  but it's not, it does not feel [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=89.24s)]
*  that it's going to be eradicated, not now. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=93.4s)]
*  We need to use much more force [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=98.72s)]
*  in order to convince him [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=101.72s)]
*  that this is its last chance, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=106.2s)]
*  and then maybe in the future, the near future, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=108.32s)]
*  we can get a better deal. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=111.96000000000001s)]
*  Oded, in the original reporting [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=114.92s)]
*  before the Israeli government and then Hamas [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=117.0s)]
*  agreed to this hostage negotiation, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=119.6s)]
*  you called it blackmail, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=122.68s)]
*  and I understand why you say that. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=123.6s)]
*  The original reporting was that Iran would have to agree [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=125.24s)]
*  not to use drone surveillance over Gaza. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=128.4s)]
*  Do you know if that is included in the final deal? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=131.4s)]
*  It's difficult to say what is included [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=136.0s)]
*  in the final deal or not, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=138.12s)]
*  but I think eventually, the next few hours, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=139.76s)]
*  we will all know what is included in the final deals. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=143.0s)]
*  Right now, it seems that this is included [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=146.52s)]
*  in the final deal, which actually hinders [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=149.72s)]
*  Israeli efforts to gather intelligence on the ground. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=154.28s)]
*  You must understand that most fundamental intelligence [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=158.68s)]
*  that's being gathered is on the ground. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=164.0s)]
*  It's by troops, it's by drones, it's by documents, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=167.60000000000002s)]
*  whatever you have access to. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=173.6s)]
*  So this hinders, in a way, our ability [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=176.8s)]
*  to see how the Hamas is going to regain its force, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=182.68s)]
*  change its position, and even reach more hostages. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  Oded, so right now, they've been in there [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=194.0s)]
*  for about three weeks inside. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=196.24s)]
*  They're able to go into a mosque. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=198.32s)]
*  I understand one of the big stories yesterday, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=199.52s)]
*  they went into a mosque and saw a whole weapons depot [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=200.98s)]
*  and weapons plant inside a mosque. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=203.45999999999998s)]
*  So they have information on the ground. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=205.85999999999999s)]
*  To see, evidently, our special forces also on the ground. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=208.22s)]
*  How much information and intelligence can we get [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=211.14s)]
*  if there is a drone, which they're all undetectable [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=214.01999999999998s)]
*  by the eye, above, to see where these hostages emerge? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=216.78s)]
*  How valuable is that? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=221.38s)]
*  Enormous, because right now, the Hamas will use the pose, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=225.5s)]
*  and I call it the pose, for a few purposes. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=230.66s)]
*  First of all, to regain supply. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=233.46s)]
*  Second, to move hostages where they are in a place [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=237.3s)]
*  that the Hamas thinks are not safe enough [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=241.94s)]
*  for their purposes. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=244.94s)]
*  And the most important thing is to have an overall view [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=246.62s)]
*  of the Israeli forces on the ground, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=251.58s)]
*  because you have to take into consideration, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=253.98s)]
*  the Hamas does not have the full picture [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=256.2s)]
*  of where we are and what we are doing, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=261.17999999999995s)]
*  because they are partially blinded by the fact [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=262.65999999999997s)]
*  that they have to hide in the tunnels. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=266.5s)]
*  This will enable them to see the overall picture, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=268.82s)]
*  and this can be a major risk to the Israeli forces [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=272.85999999999996s)]
*  that are right now on the ground. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=277.46s)]
*  So, Ded, I guess the next question would be, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=279.02s)]
*  okay, we know part of the negotiation with Hamas, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=281.62s)]
*  but what does this mean for the Houthi rebels? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=285.09999999999997s)]
*  What does this mean for Hezbollah? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=287.58s)]
*  Do they pause as well? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=289.82s)]
*  Or are they gonna be assisting Hamas [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=292.05999999999995s)]
*  trying to get some of their major commanders out of town? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=294.5s)]
*  Because I think that's part of the calculus here. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=298.73999999999995s)]
*  They can always reorganize and get more folks on the ground, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=301.53999999999996s)]
*  but they need their leaders to stay in place [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=306.64s)]
*  for their ideology purposes, right? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=309.38s)]
*  Absolutely, I think the Hamas is trying desperately [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=312.94s)]
*  to gain support from the Houthi, from Hezbollah, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=318.58s)]
*  from Iraq, and from other places, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=322.98s)]
*  and especially from the West Bank. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=326.46s)]
*  Right now, they've failed on all fronts. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=330.3s)]
*  I mean, the Hezbollah is joining the war, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=332.86s)]
*  but on a very, very medium scale. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=337.06s)]
*  So, of course, the Houthi and the Hezbollah [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=341.54s)]
*  will try to, let's say, increase their effort for support, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=345.14s)]
*  but I'm not sure how much it is working [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=351.3s)]
*  and how much it is actually supporting the Hamas leaders. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=356.02s)]
*  There's a lot of people who feel as though [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=359.58s)]
*  Hezbollah has gotta be neutralized [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=360.74s)]
*  at the end of this conflict, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=362.65999999999997s)]
*  because a lot of people in Israel do not feel safe, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=363.78s)]
*  even if Hamas is virtually defeated and destroyed. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=366.82s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us, Oded. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=371.02s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=372.58s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=373.41999999999996s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hChb0jIXziI&t=374.94s)]
