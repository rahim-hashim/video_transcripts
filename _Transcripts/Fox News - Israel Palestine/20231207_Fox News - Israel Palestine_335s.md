# Israeli ambassador to UN: 'Words are not enough'
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk)
*  Ambassador to the United Nations, Ambassador Gilad Erdogan, it's great to have you here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=0.0s)]
*  First on the campus situation here in America. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=3.92s)]
*  Let's get your take on the fact that it took them a day to have to realize they had to [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=6.32s)]
*  figure out a way to clean up the mess that they'd made. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=10.28s)]
*  Frightening. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=13.24s)]
*  I don't believe them. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=14.24s)]
*  We expected to see moral clarity, but we got moral depravity from all of these presidents. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=15.48s)]
*  That's the reason why I insist on traveling now from university to university and screen [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=22.28s)]
*  the Hamas horror footage to show the students, at least the students, who are we fighting [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=27.2s)]
*  against because if their universities cannot support Israel, a democratic country, a law-abiding [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=34.32s)]
*  country against a designated terrorist jihadist organization, so I think every American should [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  be frightened. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=47.68s)]
*  Do you have students who will come to the screening and what's their reaction after [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=48.68s)]
*  they see it? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=50.92s)]
*  Hundreds. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=51.92s)]
*  Hundreds. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=52.92s)]
*  They are shocked. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=53.92s)]
*  They are shocked after they understand who their colleagues, their peers are chanting [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=54.92s)]
*  and in support of on campus colleges. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=61.04s)]
*  I think, again, words are not enough right now. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=65.2s)]
*  We've seen thousands of people chanting in support of these terrorists, supporting the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=71.36s)]
*  genocide of the Jewish people. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=78.12s)]
*  Right now we expect the university president to expel students, to fire professors. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=80.6s)]
*  We need actions. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=86.86s)]
*  Empty words are not enough right now. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  At the moment, too, you have, what, 138 Israelis held hostage. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  We believe seven to nine of those might be Americans. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=94.66s)]
*  Seems like their lives and their situation and circumstance just gets lost in all this. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=98.32s)]
*  I don't know if they're still with us. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=104.0s)]
*  I don't know if they're alive or dead. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  I don't know if they're coming home yet or not. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=107.8s)]
*  But John Kirby made a comment about the International Red Cross. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=109.84s)]
*  It's their job to insist with the leaders of a mosque that they get access to the hostages. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=113.06s)]
*  He said this from the podium at the White House just yesterday. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=119.12s)]
*  Mosques not allowed Red Cross in to visit the hostages as they agreed to do. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  And it's unacceptable. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  I mean, one of the things you all keep asking us, and rightly so, about the condition of [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  these hostages, what we know about them. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=131.32s)]
*  The truth is we don't know a lot. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=133.0s)]
*  And the truth also is that the Red Cross has largely escaped our conversation. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=134.6s)]
*  For two months now, we had a father on last week who he hasn't heard from his son since [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=139.36s)]
*  the 7th of October. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=144.9s)]
*  And he's imploring the Red Cross to get verification of the lives of these hostages. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=145.9s)]
*  It hasn't happened. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  I think that now we commemorate like 60 days from the beginning of this terrible war from [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=152.4s)]
*  October 7th. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=158.96s)]
*  And one of our lessons is definitely that the UN, with all of its bodies and agencies, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=160.44000000000003s)]
*  is morally distorted, morally corrupted. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=167.72s)]
*  The UN that was founded in the wake of the Holocaust cannot prevent atrocities. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=171.8s)]
*  If anything, so they ensure atrocities. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=177.84s)]
*  You gave one example, the failure of the Red Cross. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=180.98s)]
*  But it's not only the Red Cross. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=184.76s)]
*  It's the Security Council. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=186.28s)]
*  It's the General Assembly. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=187.28s)]
*  All of the UN bodies failed to unequivocally condemn Hamas. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=189.04s)]
*  They failed to demand accountability from the terrorists of Hamas. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=194.2s)]
*  Had the people in Gaza would hear that they suffer first and foremost only because of [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=199.92s)]
*  Hamas that is using them as human shields, maybe we could see a change in Gaza. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=206.0s)]
*  But the only hope of Hamas to survive against the Israeli defense forces, against our military, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=211.95999999999998s)]
*  their hope is the UN and the international community. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=220.2s)]
*  They expect them to tie our hands. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=223.94s)]
*  One thing about the future of Gaza and what happens with the 2 million Palestinians still [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=227.57999999999998s)]
*  living there is, what does Israel do? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=234.3s)]
*  Does the IDF occupy it? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=237.06s)]
*  Do you flood the tunnels? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=239.3s)]
*  Can you destroy the tunnels? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=240.78s)]
*  When do Israelis feel safe enough to live in the southern part of their country again? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=242.98s)]
*  All these issues, and they're big too, have yet to be decided. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=247.26s)]
*  What happens? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=251.44s)]
*  I think it's quite clear today for all of us after 60 days that we have made a terrible [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=252.94s)]
*  mistake in the past because genocidal organization like the Nazis, like ISIS, like Hamas cannot [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=257.8s)]
*  be changed with economic incentives. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=264.7s)]
*  They must be eradicated. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=267.6s)]
*  And this time the people of Israel and the Jewish people, we feel a sense of unity we [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=269.48s)]
*  never felt before. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=274.36s)]
*  We are willing to pay the ultimate price and we're paying it. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=275.36s)]
*  Our soldiers are paying it every day in order to eradicate Hamas and release the hostages. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=279.08s)]
*  And we will continue in this mission, in this war until Hamas is eradicated and until our [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=285.47999999999996s)]
*  people can go back and live near our southern border, northern border. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=292.47999999999996s)]
*  We have 250,000 people who were displaced since this war started because they don't [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=298.36s)]
*  feel safe going back to their homes. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=304.28s)]
*  We are committed to ensuring their security and that's why we will continue until Hamas [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=308.24s)]
*  is eradicated. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=314.08000000000004s)]
*  And I promise you, it will happen. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=315.08000000000004s)]
*  Even if it will take another month or two, it will happen. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=318.20000000000005s)]
*  We will achieve our goals. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=321.84000000000003s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, happy Hanukkah to you. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=323.44000000000005s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=325.92s)]
*  Happy Hanukkah and light, as you said, will be victorious. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=326.92s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=332.0s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=333.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl9lkRofcMk&t=334.8s)]
