# Benjamin Netanyahu: We will continue until Hamas is eradicated
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc)
*  Joining us now to talk about the war is Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for the time. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=4.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=6.4s)]
*  Good to be with you, Brett. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=7.4s)]
*  First of all, give us your assessment of where things are. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=8.76s)]
*  We understand that IDF forces are inside Gaza, inside and around Gaza City. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=11.48s)]
*  Where do you see this at this hour? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=17.900000000000002s)]
*  I think the Israeli army is performing exceptionally well. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=20.44s)]
*  It's fighting the terrorists both above ground and below ground. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=24.42s)]
*  We're doing everything in our power to reduce civilian casualties. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=27.639999999999997s)]
*  We've managed safe zones and safe corridors so civilians can heed our call to leave, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=31.799999999999997s)]
*  even though Hamas is trying to keep them in. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=37.44s)]
*  And I think the war is proceeding well. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=40.08s)]
*  We're going to continue until we eradicate Hamas. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=42.44s)]
*  Nothing will stop that. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=46.0s)]
*  We're absolutely committed to victory, which is not only our victory, but it's the victory [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=47.44s)]
*  of the entire civilized world against barbarism. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=52.28s)]
*  Do you still believe that the Hamas leadership, including Yahya Sinwar, is still in or underneath [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=56.28s)]
*  Gaza City? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=63.84s)]
*  Oh, it's there, but we'll get there. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=64.84s)]
*  To get those leaders, how long do you envision this being? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=67.92s)]
*  Will it be an occupation of Gaza for months and months? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=74.08s)]
*  Well, first of all, we don't seek to govern Gaza. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=77.88s)]
*  We don't seek to occupy it, but we seek to give it and us a better future in the entire [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=81.44s)]
*  Middle East. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  And that requires defeating Hamas. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=87.39999999999999s)]
*  I've set goals. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=90.08s)]
*  I didn't set a timetable because, you know, it can take more time. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=91.24s)]
*  I wish it'll take little time. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=94.56s)]
*  But we're proceeding step by step, reducing our casualties in the process, trying to reduce [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=96.36s)]
*  and minimize civilian casualties and maximize the casualties of the Hamas terrorists. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=101.84s)]
*  And so far, I think it's proceeding well. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=106.56s)]
*  But again, you know, this is a war game. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=109.4s)]
*  You fought ISIS. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=111.92s)]
*  You fought al-Qaeda. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=112.92s)]
*  It took you a long time. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=113.92s)]
*  I don't think it'll take us that long by any stretch of the imagination. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=115.48s)]
*  But however long it takes, we'll do it because our future, the future of our neighbors, the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=119.2s)]
*  future of the Palestinians, the future of the world, I think, is related to who wins. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=125.28s)]
*  Does the axis of terror of Iran, Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, do they win? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=131.16s)]
*  Or do the forces of progress and prosperity, Israel, the United States, the modern Arab [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=137.17999999999998s)]
*  States, do we win? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=141.85999999999999s)]
*  It's important that we win. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=144.05999999999997s)]
*  And you know, history has shown that, you know, it doesn't necessarily favor the good [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=145.17999999999998s)]
*  guys over the bad guys. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=148.89999999999998s)]
*  If the bad guys have more will, more resolve, more staying power, then they win. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=150.5s)]
*  And they can cast the Middle East and the world into another period of dark ages. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=154.42s)]
*  That's where they want. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=158.82s)]
*  Well, we don't want it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=159.82s)]
*  So we have the perseverance, the will, and the resolve to win however long it takes. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=160.82s)]
*  But I'll assure you, we'll try to make it as short as we can. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=165.26s)]
*  Speaking of the United States, how firm has the push been by President Biden, his administration, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=168.89999999999998s)]
*  for these humanitarian pauses? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=174.17999999999998s)]
*  And what have you agreed to? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=176.42s)]
*  Well, one thing we haven't agreed to is a ceasefire. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=178.29999999999998s)]
*  A ceasefire with Hamas means surrender to Hamas, surrender to terror, and the victory [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=181.42s)]
*  of Iran's axis of terror. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=186.06s)]
*  So there won't be a ceasefire without the release of Israeli hostages. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=188.85999999999999s)]
*  That's not going to happen. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=193.78s)]
*  But we have agreed and have done already safe corridors. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=195.1s)]
*  You know, two days ago, 50,000 people passed from Gaza City down to the south, the safe [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=199.9s)]
*  zone, in a safe corridor. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=205.7s)]
*  Today, I think another 70,000 have passed. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=207.5s)]
*  That's very important because we want to get the civilians out of harm's way while Hamas [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=209.98s)]
*  is trying to stop them. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=214.46s)]
*  Two days ago, it actually fired upon the safe passage to prevent Palestinian civilians from [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=215.66s)]
*  leaving. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=221.38s)]
*  That's the enemy we're dealing with. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=222.38s)]
*  Not only do they murder, mutilate, rape, and murder women, burn children alive, take hostages [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=223.94s)]
*  of toddlers, babies, elderly, Holocaust survivors, the worst savagery perpetrated on the Jewish [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=231.70000000000002s)]
*  people since the Holocaust. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=238.86s)]
*  Not only do they do that, but they actually target their own civilians. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=241.18s)]
*  That is, they want to keep their civilians as a human shield. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=245.58s)]
*  So obviously it's a tough enemy, but I think we can overcome them. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=248.54000000000002s)]
*  Specifically, the administration talked about some kind of four-hour pause numerous times. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=253.1s)]
*  Is that true, that there's going to be some stoppage? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=259.26s)]
*  No, the fighting continues against the Hamas enemy, the Hamas terrorists. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=262.22s)]
*  But in specific locations, for a given period of a few hours here, a few hours there, we [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=267.7s)]
*  want to facilitate a safe passage of civilians away from the zone of fighting. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=272.46s)]
*  And we're doing that. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=277.28000000000003s)]
*  And in fact, we did one today. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=278.74s)]
*  We did one yesterday. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=280.86s)]
*  And I assume we'll do one tomorrow because our goal isn't to fight the Palestinian civilians. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=282.2s)]
*  It's to fight the Hamas terrorists. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=286.96s)]
*  And we make a distinction between the two. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=289.03999999999996s)]
*  They don't. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=290.84s)]
*  What about what the president has been saying publicly and saying privately to you? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=291.96s)]
*  Here's what he said today. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=296.32s)]
*  Mr. President, are you frustrated with Prime Minister Netanyahu that he has not listened [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=297.64s)]
*  more to some of the things you have asked him to do? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=301.44s)]
*  It's taken a little longer than I hoped. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=305.15999999999997s)]
*  What about that? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=306.84s)]
*  Well, it's taken a little longer than I had hoped. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=309.08s)]
*  I hope we could do it very fast. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=310.96000000000004s)]
*  But we have battle conditions on the ground, the safety of our own forces, the hostages [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=312.28000000000003s)]
*  we want to get out, and the humanitarian corridors we want to effect, which, as I said, Hamas [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=317.24s)]
*  is preventing by using its own fire, gunpoint, preventing Palestinian civilians from leaving. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=321.96000000000004s)]
*  So it's taken a little while. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=328.52000000000004s)]
*  But I think we share a common goal. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=329.72s)]
*  And I very much appreciate the support that President Biden has shown, the administration [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=331.36s)]
*  has shown, and frankly, the American people have shown. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=335.8s)]
*  And the Congress has shown on both sides of the aisle. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=339.16s)]
*  That's very, very important. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=341.20000000000005s)]
*  That support, the American support and President Biden's support, is deeply, deeply appreciated. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=343.68s)]
*  Speaking of Congress, we just had a congresswoman from Michigan censured by the House of Representatives, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=349.32s)]
*  Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, for using and posting from the river to the sea. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=355.6s)]
*  This was her explanation of that. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=360.8s)]
*  Many people in this movement for human rights for Palestinians have always centered around coexistence. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=363.32000000000005s)]
*  You hear them calling for that and saying that, you know, no matter your faith, your [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=369.08s)]
*  ethnicity, your background, you should be able to live without fear, without discrimination, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=373.44s)]
*  without this kind of inequality that Netanyahu's extremist party and his leadership has been [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=378.08s)]
*  pushing. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=383.12s)]
*  And so for many of my colleagues, they know, and deep in their hearts, where my heart is. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=384.12s)]
*  So when you hear from the river to the sea, what do you think? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=389.44s)]
*  One, and two, are you surprised by all the pushback, not just in the United States with [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=392.24s)]
*  these protests, but around the world? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=396.97999999999996s)]
*  From the river to the sea means there's no Israel. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=399.09999999999997s)]
*  From the Jordan River to the Mediterranean, which is a tiny area, by the way, that encompasses [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=401.12s)]
*  Israel, there is no Israel. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=406.09999999999997s)]
*  And so what this congresswoman is calling for is poliside and genocide, the elimination [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=407.79999999999995s)]
*  of the Jewish state, the one and only Jewish state of the Jewish people. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=413.29999999999995s)]
*  So that's absurd, and I salute the Congress for censoring her. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=417.29999999999995s)]
*  But it's beyond that. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=420.88s)]
*  I think the protests that you're seeing, I'm sure it includes some naive people, but there [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=422.03999999999996s)]
*  are a lot of people who know exactly what they're saying. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=426.06s)]
*  And what they're saying is that therefore ISIS, I said Hamas is ISIS, but the German [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=428.7s)]
*  chancellor said, no, they're worse. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=434.78s)]
*  They're the Nazis, the new Nazis. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=436.21999999999997s)]
*  And President Biden said they're worse than ISIS. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=438.26s)]
*  So they're lining up with ISIS, with al-Qaeda, with these murderers, with these baby-buriers, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=441.24s)]
*  with these rapists, and with these mutilators, these head-choppers. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=446.53999999999996s)]
*  This is what they're aligning themselves with. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=450.62s)]
*  And we have to protect not only our lives, but our future. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=453.72s)]
*  Can our world survive if people go and with such moral confusion and, in fact, moral depravity [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=457.24s)]
*  support these killers, these murderers? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=466.48s)]
*  And I think it's very important that this was censured. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=469.04s)]
*  And I'll tell you something. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=473.08000000000004s)]
*  This is an indictment of, I suppose, of higher education in many places in the West, when [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=474.08000000000004s)]
*  people who are supposedly educated cannot distinguish right from wrong and good from [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=479.72s)]
*  evil. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=484.88000000000005s)]
*  Hamas is evil. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=485.88000000000005s)]
*  Hamas is evil, and we have to defeat evil, not protest and demonstrate on behalf of evil. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=486.88000000000005s)]
*  There are leaders in your region who are concerned that you are going to go into Gaza and stay [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=491.88000000000005s)]
*  and possibly displace either Palestinians there or in the West Bank. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=496.32000000000005s)]
*  Here's some of them. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=502.76000000000005s)]
*  Any appearance or circumstances that would result in either mass displacement or short-term [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=504.88000000000005s)]
*  displacement of Palestinians in Gaza or the West Bank or their surroundings in any direction [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=509.44s)]
*  outside the borders of Gaza or the West Bank is a red line and means, among other things, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=515.7s)]
*  a declaration of a state of war. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=521.4s)]
*  Pushing a million people from their home and concentrating them in areas without adequate [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=523.8s)]
*  infrastructure is false displacement. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=528.68s)]
*  What do you say to those leaders and those concerns and what the future looks like as [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=531.52s)]
*  Gaza for however long you're going to be there? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=536.62s)]
*  Well, we don't seek to displace anyone. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=539.62s)]
*  What we're trying to do is get the Gazans in the northern part of the Gaza Strip, where [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=542.74s)]
*  the fighting has taken place, to move a few, well, actually a mile or two, three miles, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=547.78s)]
*  four miles down to the south of the Gaza Strip, where we've established a safe zone. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=552.86s)]
*  We want to see field hospitals. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=557.58s)]
*  We're encouraging and providing, enabling humanitarian help to go there. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=559.26s)]
*  That's how we're fighting this war. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=563.88s)]
*  But let me say this. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=565.66s)]
*  I think it's clear what Gaza's future has to look like. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=566.8s)]
*  At the end of this battle, Hamas will be gone. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=570.66s)]
*  We'll destroy Hamas. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=573.92s)]
*  We need to, not only for our sake, but really for the sake of everyone, for the sake of [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=575.02s)]
*  civilization, for the sake of Palestinians and Israelis alike. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=579.4399999999999s)]
*  What we have to see is Gaza demilitarized, de-radicalized, and rebuilt. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=583.06s)]
*  And it could, all of that can be achieved. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=589.56s)]
*  We don't seek to conquer Gaza. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=592.04s)]
*  We don't seek to occupy Gaza. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=594.0799999999999s)]
*  And we don't seek to govern Gaza. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=595.8399999999999s)]
*  We'll have to find a government, a civilian government that will be there. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=597.66s)]
*  But in the foreseeable future, we have to make sure that this doesn't happen again. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=601.54s)]
*  So we have to have a credible force that, if necessary, will enter Gaza and kill the [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=606.14s)]
*  killers, because that's what will prevent the re-emergence of a Hamas-like end to town. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=611.56s)]
*  What I expect to see, what I expect to see is a rebuilt Gaza for the Gazans. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=617.4s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, last thing. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=621.9599999999999s)]
*  It was 50 days ago that I came back from Saudi Arabia after interviewing the Crown Prince [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=623.72s)]
*  there. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=628.72s)]
*  I then interviewed you on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=629.72s)]
*  There's just a clip of that. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=632.48s)]
*  So you think, if you were to characterize it, are you close? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=634.8s)]
*  Every day we get closer. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=637.4399999999999s)]
*  It seems it's for the first time a real one, serious. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=640.56s)]
*  We're going to see how it goes. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=644.86s)]
*  I know you heard those words from the Saudi Crown Prince. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=646.24s)]
*  What was your response? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=648.84s)]
*  Well, I was delighted to hear what he had to say and to borrow a phrase. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=649.84s)]
*  I think we're getting closer to peace every day that passes. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=655.36s)]
*  It's hard to believe, Mr. Prime Minister, that was just 50 days ago, how much the world [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=659.92s)]
*  has changed. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=663.92s)]
*  What do you say to people who look at that and say that is completely abandoned and is [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=665.28s)]
*  never going to happen again? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=669.8s)]
*  I think they're wrong. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=672.7s)]
*  I think there's a test now for the forces of civilization and progress against the forces [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=674.12s)]
*  of medievalism and want to take us back to the Dark Ages. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=678.8000000000001s)]
*  We're committed and resolved, absolutely sure of our capacity to achieve this victory, which [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=683.0s)]
*  is not only our victory, but it's your victory too, Brett. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=689.6800000000001s)]
*  It's America's victory. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=692.96s)]
*  It's the moderate Arab states victory. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=694.44s)]
*  It's the victory of humanity. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=697.2800000000001s)]
*  I think once we achieve that, that promise of peace that we first branched out in the [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=699.76s)]
*  Abraham Accords and we were about to expand further with peace between Israel and Saudi [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=706.8s)]
*  Arabia, I think it will be a reality. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=711.56s)]
*  I think conditions will be ripe. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=713.52s)]
*  In fact, after a victory, I think they'll be even riper. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=715.4s)]
*  We appreciate your time during this war. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=718.88s)]
*  Thank you, Brett. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLVTCJfRgLc&t=721.28s)]
