# 31 babies evacuated from Gaza's Al-Shifa hospital
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0)
*  Trey Yengst, he is live in southern Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=0.0s)]
*  And Trey, you've got the latest for us on the evacuation [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=3.14s)]
*  of some of the patients from the hospitals in question. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=7.1000000000000005s)]
*  How does that stand at this point? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=9.700000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, John, exactly. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=13.94s)]
*  Good afternoon. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  I do want to start with some good news amid this horrific [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=16.48s)]
*  story. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=18.48s)]
*  31 babies that were being treated at Gaza's Al-Shifa [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=20.14s)]
*  Hospital were evacuated to southern Gaza over the weekend. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=22.56s)]
*  28 of them made it into Egypt today where they will receive [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  more medical treatment. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=29.38s)]
*  This was all coordinated by the United Nations and the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=30.46s)]
*  Palestinian Red Crescent with the help of the Israeli army. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=33.019999999999996s)]
*  And we do expect more patients to be evacuated from Shifa [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=36.56s)]
*  Hospital later today. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=39.16s)]
*  It comes as the Israeli military is operating in and [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=41.04s)]
*  around Gaza City. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=43.84s)]
*  They released new information last night indicating that two [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=45.26s)]
*  foreign hostages were actually taken into Shifa Hospital in [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=48.68s)]
*  the early hours of the massacre on October 7th. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=52.3s)]
*  That according to CCTV video, the men, a Thai and Nepalese [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=55.22s)]
*  worker flanked by Hamas gunmen at the time were not showing the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=59.04s)]
*  video out of respect for their families, but the revelation [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=62.64s)]
*  raising new questions about what international organizations [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=65.14s)]
*  that operate within the hospital knew about the hostages. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=68.66s)]
*  Also overnight, the Israeli military, along with the Shibet [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=71.68s)]
*  Security Agency, released a new video of the tunnel system they [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=74.36s)]
*  say is beneath the medical facility. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=77.72s)]
*  The initial tunnel shaft found on the hospital grounds is 30 [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=79.8s)]
*  feet deep with a staircase. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=82.6s)]
*  It connects to a 160 foot tunnel that ends with a door. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=84.44s)]
*  The Israelis do expect to find more as they dig around this [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=88.02s)]
*  area. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=90.7s)]
*  As the IDF pushes into and below Gaza City, there are new [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=91.36s)]
*  regional concerns about Iran and its proxies climbing an [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=94.6s)]
*  unstable escalation ladder. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=97.8s)]
*  On Sunday, Iran-backed Houthi rebels hijacked a cargo ship in [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=99.7s)]
*  the Red Sea. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=102.7s)]
*  The British-owned ship called the Galaxy Leader had no Israeli [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=103.74s)]
*  citizens on board and was traveling from Turkey to India [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=106.53999999999999s)]
*  when it was intercepted. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=109.72s)]
*  A lot of developments this weekend and it does come as the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=110.97999999999999s)]
*  Northern Front remains extremely active with dozens of rockets [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=113.68s)]
*  fired by the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah into northern [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=117.16000000000001s)]
*  Israel. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=119.94s)]
*  John? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  And we should just point out, Trey, that last week at the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=121.58s)]
*  State Department briefing, a correspondent was asking Matt [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=124.30000000000001s)]
*  Miller a question about those premature infants at [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=126.74000000000001s)]
*  Al-Shifa Hospital. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  And he remarked, they're probably all dead by now, which [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=131.38s)]
*  clearly, based on that evacuation, Trey, is not the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=135.06s)]
*  case. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=137.62s)]
*  Yeah, it's irresponsible reporting. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=141.22s)]
*  The reality is here, there are incredibly challenging times for [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=142.72s)]
*  the Palestinian people inside Gaza and the Israelis are giving [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=146.82s)]
*  them limited aid. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=150.26s)]
*  But we're also posing questions to the Israeli military and [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  government. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=153.76s)]
*  They say they're giving food and water to the Palestinian people, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=154.54s)]
*  but often they need anesthesia drugs and different medicine for [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=157.06s)]
*  the hospitals. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  But when it comes to those babies, they're very much alive. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=160.78s)]
*  We do understand that some of them passed away amid the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=163.34s)]
*  ongoing fighting that was taking place in Gaza City. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=166.92s)]
*  A tragic update to this story. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=169.38s)]
*  But the bottom line here, 31 of them made it to safety and 28 are [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=171.18s)]
*  in Egypt at this hour receiving new treatment. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=174.62s)]
*  Trey Yanks with the very latest force from southern Israel. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=176.82s)]
*  Trey, as always, thank you. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCRcOHJ7dy0&t=179.5s)]
