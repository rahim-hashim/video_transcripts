# Iran planning imminent attack on Israel, White House reports
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q)
*  A statement just out from the White House, here it is, quote, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=0.0s)]
*  The United States has indications that Iran is preparing to eminently launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=2.68s)]
*  We are actively supporting defensive preparations to defend Israel against this attack. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=8.36s)]
*  A direct military attack from Iran against Israel will carry severe consequences for Iran, end quote. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  And the incursion into Lebanon follows the targeted strike in Beirut that took out Hezbollah's top boss. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=19.72s)]
*  More airstrikes overnight leveling several buildings in suburban Beirut where Israeli troops press ahead [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=25.08s)]
*  with a rapidly escalating offensive against Hezbollah, a heavily armed and well-trained militia [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=30.84s)]
*  opening a new front in a year-long war against Iranian-backed adversaries. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  ...about the Islamic Republic of Iran because they are the source of violence and instability. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=42.28s)]
*  They are the ones that are threatening U.S. troops in the Middle East. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=48.4s)]
*  In the not-so-distant future, that is where Israeli focus will go. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=51.36s)]
*  We have some other fish to fry, to deal with first, Hamas and Hezbollah. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=55.56s)]
*  Chief Foreign Correspondent Trey Yanks is live in Haifa in northern Israel. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=61.4s)]
*  And a big day for you with the book release as well. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=65.24s)]
*  Could not be more timely, Trey. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=67.84s)]
*  Yeah, Dana, good morning. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=71.8s)]
*  Really significant developments here in the Middle East. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=72.8s)]
*  Just over the past few minutes, U.S. officials are now warning of an imminent Iranian ballistic [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=75.08s)]
*  missile attack against Israel. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=80.68s)]
*  This comes just days after the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in an Israeli [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=82.88000000000001s)]
*  strike in the Lebanese capital of Beirut. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=88.44000000000001s)]
*  Remember, Nasrallah was the leader of Iran's largest proxy across the Middle East. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=91.04s)]
*  And overnight, Israeli forces entering into southern Lebanon on the ground. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  A lot of developments here, and we're tracking all of them for you. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=100.64000000000001s)]
*  Last night, I was with an Israeli commando unit as they targeted Hezbollah positions [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=104.12s)]
*  in southern Lebanon. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=109.32000000000001s)]
*  We saw Israeli forces staging on the border and entering very quietly, trying to go after [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=110.6s)]
*  this buffer zone that they are creating between Israel and Lebanon to eventually allow Israeli [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=116.64s)]
*  civilians to return to their homes in the northern part of this country. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=122.56s)]
*  There are questions, though, about what comes next and how far Israeli forces will enter [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=126.75999999999999s)]
*  into Lebanon. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=130.95999999999998s)]
*  This morning, the Israeli military announced that 20 different towns and villages in southern [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=132.32s)]
*  Lebanon are being ordered to evacuate north of the Latani River, an indication the Israelis [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=137.78s)]
*  are likely to expand their ground operations inside Lebanon as this country braces for [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=143.22s)]
*  the possibility of a fresh attack from Iran in the coming hours or days. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=148.57999999999998s)]
*  Dana? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=152.94s)]
*  No. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=153.94s)]
*  Go ahead, Dana. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=154.94s)]
*  Troy, I had one question on the evacuation because I was just reading an article about [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=155.94s)]
*  it this morning. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=157.82s)]
*  I mean, we're looking at a map right here. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=158.82s)]
*  If you're evacuating from Lebanon, where are you going? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=162.06s)]
*  It's a great question, and there are more than a million Lebanese civilians currently [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=166.94s)]
*  displaced from their homes as a result of the Israeli air and ground campaign. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=171.14s)]
*  Many of them are going to the Lebanese capital of Beirut, but tens of thousands are actually [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=175.82s)]
*  evacuating into neighboring Syria, and it gives you a sense of just how dire the situation [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=180.3s)]
*  is as the Israeli airstrikes increase against this Hezbollah stronghold in the southern [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=185.5s)]
*  part of the country. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=190.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=191.5s)]
*  History tells you the Israelis in southern Lebanon always doesn't work out that great. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=192.5s)]
*  In 2006, that was the case, and that's what they found out on the ground. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=196.38s)]
*  Do you get a sense from the IDF people you speak with, Troy, that this operation can [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=200.18s)]
*  and will be different? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=204.94s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=207.54s)]
*  The Israelis right now are describing this as a limited raid over the border, but I can [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=209.62s)]
*  tell you based on our reporting and actually being inside southern Lebanon just hours ago, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=214.12s)]
*  the Israelis are preparing to stay for a significant amount of time. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=219.98s)]
*  There are a variety of ground forces involved in these operations, and it's not just one [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=223.82s)]
*  area along the border. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=227.9s)]
*  They are trying to target as many of the Hezbollah strongholds in these areas so that people [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=229.54s)]
*  can return to their homes, and they say that in the tunnel network that Hezbollah dug near [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=234.78s)]
*  to the Israel-Lebanon border, they're finding things like anti-tank guided missiles and [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=239.28s)]
*  ammunition that have been smuggled into southern Lebanon via Syria coming directly from the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=243.78s)]
*  Iranian regime. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=249.46s)]
*  Israeli politics is always fascinating and often contentious, and Bibi Netanyahu has [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=251.38s)]
*  had his ups and downs, but certainly I would imagine after last week more up than down. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=256.26s)]
*  At this point, as we hear from the White House, that they also have indication that Iran is [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=262.58s)]
*  planning to attack Israel. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=266.46s)]
*  How is the leadership of Israel faring at this point as they press their advantage? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=268.65999999999997s)]
*  Look, the dynamic for Israeli leadership has changed just in the past two weeks. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=274.3s)]
*  If you think back to a year ago today, before the October 7th massacre, the largest threat [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=280.56s)]
*  for Israel was Iran and its largest proxy, Hezbollah. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=285.96s)]
*  We were briefed on the threat from Hezbollah, and the understanding was that in the early [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=289.32s)]
*  days of a conflict with the group that holds territory just about 17 miles from here, that [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=293.4s)]
*  6,000 rockets would rain down on Israeli cities each and every day. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=299.0s)]
*  We never saw that, and that's because the Israelis launched a significant preemptive [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=303.04s)]
*  strike campaign against Hezbollah rocket and missile launching positions. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=307.16s)]
*  They then conducted this pager attack that took out around 1,500 to 2,000 Hezbollah operatives [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=311.32000000000005s)]
*  across Lebanon, and then ultimately they systematically targeted the leadership of this organization [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=317.82000000000005s)]
*  and saw very little response. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=324.16s)]
*  Today sirens were sounding in Israel's second largest city of Tel Aviv. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=325.92s)]
*  A few rockets fired there. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=329.36s)]
*  In the distance we saw some interceptions earlier today, but there's been no significant [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=331.12s)]
*  response from Hezbollah, and that is likely why we are seeing this new threat from Iran, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=335.2s)]
*  because the Iranian regime is trying to save face in all of this, understanding that the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=339.92s)]
*  Israelis have not only destroyed one of their largest proxies in Gaza, Hamas, but now their [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=344.15999999999997s)]
*  largest proxy, Hezbollah, in Lebanon. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=349.32s)]
*  Trey Yanks out with a new book today called Black Saturday, talking about October 7th [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=351.76s)]
*  and the aftermath as you continue to cover this breaking news story. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=356.32s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=359.34s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdvSCVIpc5Q&t=360.34s)]
