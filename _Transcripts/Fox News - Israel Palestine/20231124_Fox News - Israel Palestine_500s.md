# Israeli officials on 'high alert' despite cease-fire with Hamas
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg)
*  Siren sounding in Israel's Red Sea region this morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=0.0s)]
*  Warning of a potential long-range aerial attack from Yemen. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=4.48s)]
*  This all comes hours into the Israel Hamas ceasefire and before 13 hostages are expected [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=7.84s)]
*  to be freed by Hamas. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=12.84s)]
*  The first of 50 total over the next four days. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=14.36s)]
*  Alex Hogan is in Jerusalem with all the details. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=16.44s)]
*  Hi Alex. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=19.12s)]
*  Hi Carly and Todd. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=20.12s)]
*  We are about five hours into this ceasefire and just less than four hours from when we [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  see these hostages start to come home. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=27.8s)]
*  What will happen? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=30.04s)]
*  We're learning more that they will go to the Hatterim air base here in Israel. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=31.04s)]
*  From there they will be transferred to other hospitals. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=34.3s)]
*  Now in terms of what all of this means for the military moving forward starting really [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=36.4s)]
*  just several hours ago. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=40.620000000000005s)]
*  What we will see from the military is that there will be no military action in Gaza, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=42.2s)]
*  no attacks, no advancements and that Israel will continue to hold its intelligence on [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=46.16s)]
*  the ground. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=51.36s)]
*  But again it will not move forward. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=52.36s)]
*  Hamas has said that Israel will need to halt all air traffic over northern Gaza from 10 [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=53.7s)]
*  a.m. until 4 p.m. each day and stop air traffic altogether over the south entirely. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=58.7s)]
*  Israel has also dropped leaflets in southern Gaza urging Palestinians to stay there. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=64.7s)]
*  Now for those who are still in the north there is this one main corridor that does remain [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=69.5s)]
*  open according to the idea for people to flee from the north to the south. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=73.74000000000001s)]
*  Now we did see smoke rising just before the truce. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=77.94s)]
*  One rocket was fired 15 minutes in but besides that it's been largely quiet. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=81.06s)]
*  There were some sirens in the southern part of Israel within the last hour but that was [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=85.46000000000001s)]
*  called off. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=89.34s)]
*  That was a false alarm. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=90.34s)]
*  Now it is worth noting that before any ceasefire we often do see ramped up military tactics [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=91.34s)]
*  as both sides are trying to hit as hard as possible before a break. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=96.14s)]
*  That is what we did see in the north yesterday. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  Hezbollah fired as many as 50 rockets in northern Israel. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=102.02000000000001s)]
*  That is much more than on a typical day. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=105.68s)]
*  There's also the major concern that any pause would allow Hamas to regroup but Israel says [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=107.74s)]
*  it will keep its strategic positions on the ground and it will resume all of this after [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=112.17999999999999s)]
*  the ceasefire. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=116.94s)]
*  We will not lose momentum. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=118.94s)]
*  We are on high alert but I can assure you that we are determined to continue all the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=120.17999999999999s)]
*  way to find the leaders of Hamas to kill them and they have one choice to surrender. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=125.0s)]
*  If they will not surrender we will come to wherever they're hiding and we will kill them. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=129.62s)]
*  So yes, it's a pause but in four or five days we are going to continue. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=136.04s)]
*  There has been a tremendous amount of pressure from the families of the hostages here in [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=143.92s)]
*  Israel to strike a deal. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=147.84s)]
*  Thousands of people have marched across the country over the last six weeks and we know [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=149.78s)]
*  that 13 people are expected to return home today and the families of those 13 people [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=152.95999999999998s)]
*  have been notified. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=157.89999999999998s)]
*  The three dual citizens, the three dual American citizens are not among those who are expected [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=158.89999999999998s)]
*  to return home today. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=163.6s)]
*  In exchange Israel will release 150 Palestinians held in Israeli jails over the next four days [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=164.96s)]
*  and 39 of them just today. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=170.52s)]
*  Now most of those people were arrested in the last year for minor offenses, things like [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=172.88s)]
*  throwing rocks but as far as these 13 people who will be returning home here in Israel [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=177.76000000000002s)]
*  today we know that they are all from the same kibbutz according to the Israeli government [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=182.8s)]
*  and they're also, some of them at least, are going to be sent to a children's hospital [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=187.14000000000001s)]
*  Meaning that at least one child is among this group of people that will be coming back here today. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=192.2s)]
*  Carly, Tom? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=197.4s)]
*  We eagerly await 9am. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=198.4s)]
*  Alex, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=199.4s)]
*  Let's bring in Tom Holman, Fox's contributor and former acting ICE director. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=201.88s)]
*  Tom, good morning to you. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=205.72s)]
*  We are expecting 13 hostages to be released today in Israel but the country is still at [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=207.64000000000001s)]
*  war and back here at home FBI Director Christopher Wray says that we are in a heightened terror [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=212.44s)]
*  threat as a result of this war. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=217.64000000000001s)]
*  Weigh in on that knowing that border security and national security is becoming an increasingly [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=219.8s)]
*  important issue of concern for people here at home. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=224.84s)]
*  Well, I've been saying for two years that our open borders is probably the biggest national [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=227.24s)]
*  security failure this nation has seen since 9-11. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=232.54000000000002s)]
*  It's very vulnerable to terrorist coming to the country and I was in Israel six months [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=235.64000000000001s)]
*  ago and I went over and looked at their border security. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=240.52s)]
*  They got several different borders, of course a border with Egypt, less sophisticated, but [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=243.28s)]
*  the border with the West Bank and Gaza Strip are very sophisticated. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=247.08s)]
*  It even has better technology than we do in some parts of our border. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=250.68s)]
*  So when I saw what happened in Israel, I said wait a minute, if they can penetrate one of [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=255.32000000000002s)]
*  the most sophisticated intelligence apparatuses and border systems in the world, what's that [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=258.92s)]
*  mean to the United States who our border is wide open? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=264.92s)]
*  Look, last year 227 people, terrorists watched us from the rest of the country, our southern [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=267.56s)]
*  border. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=272.36s)]
*  At the same time, 432 through the northern border, which no one talks about. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=273.36s)]
*  So last year 659 people to terrorist forces were arrested. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=278.08000000000004s)]
*  What's most concerning is that 1.7 million gotaways. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=282.64s)]
*  Why did 1.7 million people pay more to get away? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=285.96000000000004s)]
*  Because they don't want to be vetted. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=290.24s)]
*  So since the border patrol arrested people from 171 different countries, many of these [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=291.52000000000004s)]
*  countries are sponsored with terror. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=295.8s)]
*  If you don't think a single one of that 1.7 didn't come from a country that sponsors terror, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=297.8s)]
*  then you're more than dead. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=303.15999999999997s)]
*  This is an extreme national security failure. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=304.15999999999997s)]
*  Absolutely, Tom. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=306.4s)]
*  You're making so much sense. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=307.4s)]
*  And those are all major concerns. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=309.08s)]
*  The president, the Biden administration, they're still working under a security situation of [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  October 6th, before this happened, and things have changed. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=317.59999999999997s)]
*  Even before this, releasing that many possible terrorists into this country was concerning, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=320.71999999999997s)]
*  but now even more so. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=327.28s)]
*  Why do you think, really, the Biden administration hasn't changed their strategy? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=328.96s)]
*  You know, it's shocking to me. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=332.71999999999997s)]
*  It is simply shocking. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=335.44s)]
*  I think a lot of people say, well, you can't—I've seen people testify in front of Congress, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=336.44s)]
*  where you have no evidence people across the southern border, they're a terrorist. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=340.15999999999997s)]
*  Look, I don't know how many terrorists across the southern border. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=343.15999999999997s)]
*  When I'm not—I don't believe that number's zero. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=346.24s)]
*  And here's the reason why. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=348.12s)]
*  After 9-11, we created all these different databases to try to prevent what happened [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=349.79999999999995s)]
*  on 9-11. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=354.32s)]
*  People getting a visa to come here to do harm. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=355.32s)]
*  Someone getting a plane ticket to do us harm. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=357.68s)]
*  So we created the Visa Security Program, which prevented thousands of people from getting [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=359.68s)]
*  a visa. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=363.12s)]
*  We found information, the driver told information of background. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=364.12s)]
*  We got the TSA no flyers. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=367.12s)]
*  We got the FBI screening database. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=369.12s)]
*  And they all work great. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=370.71999999999997s)]
*  But what terrorists is wrong putting themselves in a position to be vetted through these different [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=372.2s)]
*  systems when you can simply get to Mexico, pay a little bit extra money, and be one of [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=375.8s)]
*  the 1.7 main takeaways? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=380.24s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=381.84s)]
*  The southern border is a path to least resistance for anybody who wants to come to this country [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=382.84s)]
*  and do us harm. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=387.28000000000003s)]
*  And the northern border is even more of a threat. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=388.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, well, listen, you mentioned the southern border and Mexico. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=390.28000000000003s)]
*  There is a major news story out of Mexico today. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=394.0s)]
*  Authorities just arrested one of the leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=396.92s)]
*  His name is Perez Salas now. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=400.40000000000003s)]
*  AG Merrick-Arlen wants to extradite him to the United States. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=402.08000000000004s)]
*  He's wanted for distribution of fentanyl. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=404.76s)]

*  him in Mexico. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=412.18s)]

*  That's a faction of the Sinaloa Cartel. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jttTVEoisEg&t=422.48s)]
