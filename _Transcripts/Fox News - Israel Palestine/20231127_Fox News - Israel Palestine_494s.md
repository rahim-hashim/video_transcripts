# Israelis are glued to their TV to see these images, Netanyahu spokesperson says
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY)
*  Tal Heinrich, spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=0.0s)]
*  Tal, always good to have you with us. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=4.32s)]
*  Thank you very much for joining us today. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=5.96s)]
*  This is a difficult position for Israel to be in. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=11.0s)]
*  And clearly, these terrorists, they took all these people for a reason, because these releases [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=13.72s)]
*  have forced a stop in the counterattack against Hamas. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=19.92s)]
*  How hard is it going to be to eradicate Hamas with these extended periods of ceasefire? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=25.32s)]
*  It's a very difficult position to be at. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=31.4s)]
*  We didn't want this, obviously. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=33.28s)]
*  Hamas wanted this war. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=35.96s)]
*  Hamas dragged us into this war. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=37.56s)]
*  We didn't start with this war. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=39.32s)]
*  And as you know, we didn't even anticipate this war. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=40.6s)]
*  But we have to complete the mission, which is to bring back all hostages home and eradicate [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=43.08s)]
*  the Hamas regime in Gaza. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=49.44s)]
*  You see, and I'll quote Thomas Sowell here, the great Thomas Sowell, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=51.44s)]
*  There are no good solutions, only trade-offs. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=55.68s)]
*  And this is the trade-off, the outline that we have agreed upon. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=57.6s)]
*  So hopefully, we will see eventually, I'm saying hopefully, because the 11 hostages [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=60.8s)]
*  that were released reportedly are not still in Israeli territory at this point. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=65.28s)]
*  But I hope that this will bring us to a total of 50 hostages as per the deal released over [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=69.52s)]
*  the course of four days, in which we in exchange agreed to a humanitarian pause in the fighting. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=74.44s)]
*  But we hope that this mechanism in place will see more hostages released. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=79.64s)]
*  We said that for every extra 10 hostages who will be released, we will agree to an extra [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=83.88000000000001s)]
*  day of humanitarian pause in the fighting. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=88.4s)]
*  But you're completely right. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=91.72s)]
*  It's complicated. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=93.56s)]
*  You talked about Abigail Edan, a four-year-old Israeli-American. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=94.56s)]
*  You watched her smile now when she's reunited with what is left from her family, we should [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=98.0s)]
*  say. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  We want to be able to tell Abigail that she is safe, that Hamas terrorists will never [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  lay their dirty hands on her again, never kidnap her again, never rain missiles on her [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=108.16s)]
*  community again. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=113.64s)]
*  But right now, we can't say this completely. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=115.32000000000001s)]
*  Is she really safe as long as Hamas is still in power? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=118.36s)]
*  No. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=121.4s)]
*  For that reason, we will continue, we will resume the fighting and we will bring an end [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=122.4s)]
*  to this terrorist regime. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=126.84s)]
*  So you might have seen the images over the weekend of, you know, sort of effigies have [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=128.6s)]
*  wrapped bodies in front of the White House, people holding signs for ceasefire, imploring [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=134.96s)]
*  President Biden to back a more permanent ceasefire in this situation. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=143.72s)]
*  Obviously, he's under a lot of political pressure. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=149.8s)]
*  He's losing traction, especially with young voters in America. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=152.6s)]
*  What do you say to that? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=156.8s)]
*  What do you think Prime Minister Netanyahu, I know they're in touch all the time. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=158.0s)]
*  What are these conversations like? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=162.0s)]
*  Yes, Jerusalem and Washington are in touch on an hourly basis and we are very grateful [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=163.96s)]
*  for President Biden. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=169.0s)]
*  He's moral support and the moral global leadership that the people of America, bipartisan support, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=170.76000000000002s)]
*  have been demonstrating. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=176.88000000000002s)]
*  But if it wasn't for the president's input, I don't think that we would have seen these [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=178.36s)]
*  50 hostages, hopefully 50 as we're speaking, it's underway, being released. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=183.28s)]
*  And he better the conditions of this outline that we have agreed to. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=189.48000000000002s)]
*  So we're very, very thankful for that. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=192.96s)]
*  And President Biden stated correctly just a few days ago that Hamas only responds to [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=194.52s)]
*  pressure. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=198.96s)]
*  That's the only thing that works, only thanks to military pressure and diplomatic pressure [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  that we exerted in various ways we have seen the release of these hostages. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=204.44s)]
*  And we will continue with this pressure. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=208.35999999999999s)]
*  How can we talk about a permanent general ceasefire when Hamas leaders openly say that [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=210.8s)]
*  they would perpetrate the October 7th massacre for a second, a third and a fourth time? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=216.64s)]
*  What option do we have? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=220.72s)]
*  We don't. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=221.72s)]
*  You know, I'm curious, I think back to, and I'm about to talk to John Kirby and we talked [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=222.72s)]
*  about this at the time, the release of five American prisoners for five Iranian prisoners [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=226.6s)]
*  plus six billion dollars into Iran coffers. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=232.0s)]
*  The deal was criticized as completely out of balance. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=235.28s)]
*  Do you think that that motivated Iran's proxies? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=240.18s)]
*  They see that. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=244.57999999999998s)]
*  You say, look what we can get, you know? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=245.57999999999998s)]
*  And they went in there, they took 240 people to hold as hostages and pawns in this horrific [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=247.94s)]
*  game that is going on. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=257.16s)]
*  Do you think that that move by the U.S. government prompted this strategy by Hamas? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=259.38s)]
*  Iran, the Iranian regime, I would say, because I don't want to say Iran, I don't want to [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=267.8s)]
*  talk about the Iranian people. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=272.28000000000003s)]
*  The Iranian regime is evil. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=273.48s)]
*  Full stop. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=275.6s)]
*  Full stop. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=276.88s)]
*  And we know that they run their axis of evil, Hamas, which is funded 93 percent by Iran. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=277.88s)]
*  We have the Palestinian Islamic Jihad that reportedly also are holding Israeli hostages [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=283.92s)]
*  right now. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=289.6s)]
*  They're fully funded by Iran. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=290.6s)]
*  We know what the Houthis in Yemen have been doing. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=291.88s)]
*  We know what Hezbollah is doing. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=294.02000000000004s)]
*  We've had back and forth with Hezbollah. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=295.44s)]
*  And we're telling them, don't try us. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=297.36s)]
*  Iran is pulling all the strings behind the scenes and the pressure should be applied [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=299.28000000000003s)]
*  to them. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=306.28000000000003s)]
*  International pressure. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=307.90000000000003s)]
*  That's what we want to see. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=308.90000000000003s)]
*  And being told, the images that we're seeing on the screen, these are just released. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=310.21999999999997s)]
*  These are some of the 11 hostages who are right now traveling in the Red Cross custody [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=317.06s)]
*  across the Gaza border into Egypt. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=325.84s)]
*  And then they will make the trip onto Israeli territory. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=329.38s)]
*  But the moment that they are in Israeli territory and really out of Gaza territory, these, these [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=333.7s)]
*  young people and we have been trying to break this down. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=339.90000000000003s)]
*  So there's nine people between the ages of three and 51. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=343.14s)]
*  I mean, you're just seeing these little faces who are happy once again. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=346.90000000000003s)]
*  And we pray that they are all in good health. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=351.36s)]
*  18 of them are under the age of 30, two under the age of 30, nine are under the age of 18. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=353.34000000000003s)]
*  So you see some of these children on your screen who all sides have been working so [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=361.92s)]
*  hard to bring to freedom in this highly complicated situation. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=366.0s)]
*  And more of them, you have to wonder what goes through the mind of these hostages when [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=371.8s)]
*  they see some people leave and others are left behind a lot of men who are left behind [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=375.04s)]
*  a lot of fathers, husbands, brothers who are still being held and Americans among them, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=381.24s)]
*  no Americans in this group. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=386.52s)]
*  We are waiting for eight to nine Americans to be released. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=388.82s)]
*  So tell us a final thought before I let you go. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=391.88s)]
*  I'll just tell you that Israelis have been glued to their news TV screens in the past [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=393.52s)]
*  days and right now in these hours waiting to, you know, watch these heartwarming images, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=398.04s)]
*  this little tiny momentary sigh of relief amid the agony and suffering that we've been [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=403.16s)]
*  going through as a nation. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=407.52s)]
*  It's unfathomable. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=410.32s)]
*  It's a torture. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=411.5s)]
*  It's a torture of mind and soul because Hamas terrorists, they know it that we're a nation [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=412.5s)]
*  that values life to this extent. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=416.64s)]
*  Unlike them, they openly say that they want to sacrifice the Palestinian civilians of [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=419.48s)]
*  Gaza for their sickle of obliterating Israel. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=423.36s)]
*  Are you worried about the Palestinians who've been released from the prisons in Israel? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=426.0s)]
*  They've been depicted as young and that there's, you know, sort of an equivalency, young people [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=432.68s)]
*  being released as hostages, young people being released from prisons. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=437.92s)]
*  Sort of, sort of, as you say. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=441.08000000000004s)]
*  There's no equivalency here. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=442.96000000000004s)]
*  Of course we're worried. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=444.0s)]
*  We're releasing terrorists. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=445.0s)]
*  These are people who were involved in terrorist activity no matter their gender or age. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKlf1AFMERY&t=446.26s)]
