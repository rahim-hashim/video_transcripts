# Kamala Harris: The world must never forget Oct. 7
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E)
*  Got it. Robert, thank you very much. We're going to break away from this right now to the Vice [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=0.0s)]
*  President's resident, Kamala Harris, is remembering those who lost their lives this day at the start [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=3.2s)]
*  of the Hamas-Israeli War. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=8.96s)]
*  Who studied in Seattle and who was the grandson of Holocaust survivors. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=10.64s)]
*  And a dancer from California who was killed alongside her fiance while attending the Nova [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=16.96s)]
*  Music Festival. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=24.56s)]
*  I am devastated by the pain and loss that occurred on October 7. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=27.119999999999997s)]
*  And Doug and I pray for the family and loved ones of all of those who were lost. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=33.28s)]
*  And may their memories be a blessing. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=41.84s)]
*  Today I know many Jews will be reciting and reflecting on the Jewish prayer for morning, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=48.0s)]
*  the Kaddish, the words of the prayer are not about death. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  It is a prayer about our enduring belief in God, even in our darkest moments. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=60.559999999999995s)]
*  So as we reflect on the horrors of October 7, let us please be reminded that we cannot lose faith. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=70.8s)]
*  The Jewish philosopher, Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel wrote and I quote, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=83.44s)]
*  religion begins with a consciousness that something is asked of us. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=94.24s)]
*  So in this moment, on the one year commemoration of October 7, what is asked of us? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=102.24s)]
*  What is asked of us? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=112.0s)]
*  First and foremost, I believe that we must never forget. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=114.88000000000001s)]
*  I will never forget October 7 and the world must never forget. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=119.68s)]
*  What is asked of us? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=125.92s)]
*  We must work to ensure nothing like the horrors of October 7 can ever happen again. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=128.72s)]
*  And on this solemn day, I will restate my pledge to always ensure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=135.44s)]
*  And that I will always work to ensure the safety and security of the Jewish people here and around the world. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=146.16s)]
*  What is asked of us? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=156.56s)]
*  We must reunite the hostages held in Gaza with their families. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=158.8s)]
*  And I will never stop fighting for the release of all the hostages, including the American citizens living and deceased. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=163.36s)]
*  Omer, Edan, Sagi, Keith, Judy, God and Ite. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  What is asked of us? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=183.28000000000003s)]
*  We must uphold the commitment to repair the world. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  An idea that has been passed on throughout generations of the Jewish people and across many faiths. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=190.16s)]
*  And to that end, we must work to relieve the immense suffering of innocent Palestinians in Gaza who have experienced so much pain and loss over the year. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=197.44s)]
*  What is asked of us? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=210.32s)]
*  We must continue to see light. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=213.04s)]
*  What is asked of us? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=215.84s)]
*  We must continue to see light amidst the darkness. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=217.84s)]
*  As the late Rabbi Jonathan Sacks said, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=222.88s)]
*  A people that can walk through the valley of the shadow of death and still rejoice is a people that cannot be defeated by any force or fear. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=226.48s)]
*  That is why today we plant a pomegranate tree, which in Judaism is a symbol of hope and righteousness. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=240.64000000000001s)]
*  So for years to come, this pomegranate tree will stand here, spreading its roots and growing stronger. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=250.72s)]
*  To remind future vice presidents of the United States, their families and all who pass through these grounds, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=259.68s)]
*  not only of the horror of October 7th, but the strength and the endurance of the Jewish people. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=268.0s)]
*  It will remind us all not to abandon the goal of peace, dignity and security for all. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=277.92s)]
*  And it will remind us all to always have faith. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=287.28s)]
*  Thank you, and I will now turn it over to the second gentleman, my husband Doug. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=293.84s)]
*  We are following this event at the U.S. Naval Observatory, the home of the Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris, her husband now speaking. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=303.6s)]
*  The second gentleman. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=309.68s)]
*  This is to remember this day a year ago when 1200 Israelis were killed in that Hamas attack that has now spread to include Iranian operatives all over that region. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=311.68s)]
*  250 were kidnapped that day, 100 now remain captive. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=324.0s)]
*  And we had in a period of just a matter of weeks, better than 3,000 rockets hurled at the Israelis. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=328.64s)]
*  4,000 injured that day as well. We're monitoring all of that and we are monitoring a big storm coming Florida's way. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs3A_w8NW5E&t=337.04s)]
