# Inside Hamasâ€™ weapons arsenal at a kindergarten in Gaza
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA)
*  And we're back now with a Fox News alert as fighting intensifies between Israel and Hamas [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=0.0s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=6.04s)]
*  The IDF discovering weapons and explosives that belong to Hamas inside a kindergarten [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=7.12s)]
*  classroom in Gaza, as well as Hitler's manifesto in a child's home that Hamas was using as [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=13.16s)]
*  a terrorism hub. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=19.28s)]
*  Our Alex Hogan is live on the ground in northern Israel with more on all of this. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=20.92s)]
*  Hi Alex. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=25.16s)]
*  Hi Anita. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=26.16s)]
*  Hi Anita. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=27.4s)]
*  Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie is here meeting with Israeli leaders, touring [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=28.4s)]
*  areas and affirming U.S. support for Israel. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=33.56s)]
*  It is day 37 of the war. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=37.2s)]
*  So far in the last 24 hours we've seen the IDF continue to push forward in northern Gaza. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=38.76s)]
*  They say that they were able to take in 20 members of Hamas for questioning. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=44.16s)]
*  This comes after continued forces moving in by both land, air and of course by sea. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=49.08s)]
*  President also says that forces in the last day were able to recover what they say is [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=55.4s)]
*  Hitler's manifesto mine camp in a children's living room used by Hamas in a military base. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=60.28s)]
*  The IDF also says that it has seized as many as 6,000 weapons, some of those lately discovered [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=66.8s)]
*  in a kindergarten. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=72.36s)]
*  The IDF also says that Hamas is targeting civilians by having these underground tunnels [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=73.8s)]
*  underneath hospitals. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=78.68s)]
*  Well, that is where the conditions continue to deteriorate for civilians and patients [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=80.16s)]
*  in those hospitals, including infants. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=84.84s)]
*  The major hospital in Gaza is the Al-Shifa hospital where they say that they are running [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  out of fuel. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  Today Israel tried to deliver as many as 80 gallons of fuel, which they say was intercepted [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  by Hamas and not delivered. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=99.92s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had this to say about that. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=103.12s)]
*  We offered actually last night to give them enough fuel to operate the hospital, operate [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=107.36s)]
*  the incubators and so on because we have we have obviously no battle with patients or [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=113.0s)]
*  with civilians at all. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=117.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, we are in the northern part of Israel and today this has been the most action [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=119.0s)]
*  packed day that we have seen since the start of the war with 21 people just within northern [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=125.76s)]
*  Israel wounded. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=131.12s)]
*  This has already been the deadliest conflict here on the border of Israel and Lebanon since [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=132.56s)]
*  2006. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=137.84s)]
*  Anita. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=138.84s)]
*  All right, Alex Hogan live on the ground in northern Israel. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=139.84s)]
*  Thank you, Alex. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  Thank you and please stay safe. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  Okay, so Mein Kampf was found down there. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  So anyway, Joey is over at the big board with a closer look at some of the weapons that [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=150.48s)]
*  were found at that Gaza kindergarten. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=156.76s)]
*  Joey, what can you tell us about these weapons? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=158.88s)]
*  Yeah, we have a few pictures here of some of the weapons found. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=160.88s)]
*  This really shows you a little bit about tactics and capabilities that Hamas has. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=163.16s)]
*  It might give us a peek in the type of combat they anticipate. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=166.72s)]
*  The ones we see here are 100 what we call pineapple grenades. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=169.72s)]
*  All of these are hand held grenades. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=172.72s)]
*  You pull the pin, you throw them and they have these little serrations on them where [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=174.24s)]
*  they break into fragmentation all turning into dozens of bullets from each grenade. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=177.24s)]
*  What this indicates is they are anticipating hand to hand close quarters combat. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=182.56s)]
*  These can only go as far as you can throw them unless you booby trap them then they [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=186.08s)]
*  become an IED and all of this can be an IED, an improvised device. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  But these are some tools found. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=193.12s)]
*  I really want to go into this and tell you a little bit about it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=194.12s)]
*  So I am going to use the ability to draw here. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=196.52s)]
*  So what you have here is a voltmeter or an ohmmeter. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=200.12s)]
*  This is used to test either blasting caps or electric circuits probably in IEDs or certain [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=202.6s)]
*  types of munitions. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=207.24s)]
*  But up here is really the part I want to talk to you about. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=208.86s)]
*  What you have here, this is a circle and these are mills or minutes of angle and it is to [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=211.12s)]
*  a very fine detail. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  Down here you have a tool that is used to set the angle of something that you are going [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=218.32s)]
*  to use to indirect fire, to lob. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=222.4s)]
*  So what this shows is capability of mortars or other types of indirect fire, something [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=224.92s)]
*  you want to go for a long distance. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=229.55999999999997s)]
*  But you also see it is kind of rudimentary. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=231.56s)]
*  It is very simple stuff. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=233.44s)]
*  A lot of this stuff down here you get at Home Depot. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=234.44s)]
*  It is not super sophisticated. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=236.11999999999998s)]
*  And that can help account for some of the rocket attacks that land inside Gaza itself [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=238.35999999999999s)]
*  because they are not using sophisticated tools. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=242.95999999999998s)]
*  And then we will keep moving here. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=245.27999999999997s)]
*  Now this is a little bit fuzzy but I am going to explain to you what this is. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=246.27999999999997s)]
*  And so the first thing I am going to highlight here, I am going to use red. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  This is the color yellow which indicates it was probably produced by Iran. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=252.24s)]
*  What this is is an RPG. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=257.2s)]
*  This is the round that goes inside the launcher. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=258.92s)]
*  What you have here is essentially you will have a launch motor back here, then you will [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=261.84000000000003s)]
*  have a flight motor in it and then your explosives are housed in the back half here. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=267.64s)]
*  That is your explosives. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  This is your warhead. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=272.84000000000003s)]
*  The reason why that is important to note is as I clear this and move to the next one, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  you will see what these motors are. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=278.84000000000003s)]
*  And so what you see here, I can tell by the color, this bright green one and the dark [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=280.8s)]
*  green one, we have launch motors and flight motors. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=284.12s)]
*  What that means, RPGs are capable of going up to 900 yards. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=287.44s)]
*  So you could actually use them as indirect fire and use RPGs from a further distance [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=291.0s)]
*  away. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=295.24s)]
*  Having the motors that are capable of that shows that might be a part of their battle [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=296.24s)]
*  plan. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=299.71999999999997s)]
*  So all of this shows you a little bit of what they are capable of and a little bit of what [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=300.71999999999997s)]
*  they might be trying to do as far as strategy and that helps Israel prepare for what they [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=304.28s)]
*  will see. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=308.12s)]
*  Joey, so as you know, we have heard IDF say that Hamas utilizes civilian locations, specifically [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=309.6s)]
*  sensitive ones like hospitals, as is the case, kindergartens and even places of worship to [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=315.0s)]
*  hide some of their weaponry. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=320.12s)]
*  For example, what would happen if one of these were to accidentally go off in the kindergarten [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=322.02s)]
*  classroom? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=326.52s)]
*  Yeah, everything I just showed you is equivalent to a hand grenade if it goes off the wrong [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=327.52s)]
*  way. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=331.12s)]
*  If it goes off the correct way, it could take down an entire building. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=332.12s)]
*  I mean, Timothy McVeigh took out the entire Oklahoma City building with a couple of barrels [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=334.2s)]
*  of ammonium nitrate and fuel oxidizer. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=338.46s)]
*  A lot of munitions stored in one place that sympathetically detonate could take that whole [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=341.53999999999996s)]
*  building down like a hospital or an apartment complex. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=345.79999999999995s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=348.62s)]
*  Joey, thank you for that very thorough explanation. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=349.62s)]
*  Appreciate that. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6rLJMxH4KA&t=351.62s)]
