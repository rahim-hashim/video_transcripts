*  You'll see some dust there rising up from the Gaza skyline the Israeli forces are [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=28.28s)]
*  Operating in the distance in the northern part of Gaza as you said they are working to destroy the tunnel system and command centers of Hamas [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=32.800000000000004s)]
*  we do know that overnight the Israelis say they destroyed one of those command centers and [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=40.8s)]
*  Recovered a number of anti-tank guided missiles and other small arms these soldiers have been operating around Gaza City and [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=46.16s)]

*  They were escorted by Israeli tanks on the main road the artery from the northern part of Gaza to the southern part an [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=65.36s)]
*  Opportunity for those who didn't heed the previous warnings to get out of harm's way [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=73.52s)]
*  We've seen today Israeli attack helicopters and drones in the distance [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=77.64s)]
*  Despite a reduction in the number of airstrikes as this evacuation takes place [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=82.0s)]
*  Those infantry troops are still operating on the ground not only searching for the 240 [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=86.16000000000001s)]
*  Hostages the Israelis believe are being held in those tunnels [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=91.28s)]
*  But also trying to kill any Hamas leadership still in Gaza City Dana Bill Trey [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=94.28s)]
*  I had one question so in that video you just showed the people [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=99.68s)]
*  Those are who are those people that are all marching there together [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=103.16000000000001s)]
*  So those are Palestinian civilians who live in and around Gaza City [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=107.02000000000001s)]
*  That didn't take the previous warnings to leave and now as the Israelis are pushing deeper into Gaza and are expected to start [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=110.62s)]
*  Sending units into the center of Gaza City. They're trying to get those civilians out of the way [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=117.94000000000001s)]
*  So this is an evacuation of civilians the Israelis say that they are going to continue trying to get people out of the way [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=122.7s)]
*  As they push deeper into Gaza, I see and also I wanted to ask you about this prime minister. Are you all right? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=128.86s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=133.17999999999998s)]
*  I'm just gonna have my cameraman pan up here [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=135.17999999999998s)]
*  You can see one of those attack helicopters that we were talking about [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=138.17999999999998s)]
*  It's been going back and forth and actually firing into the Gaza Strip as we speak [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=141.38s)]
*  And you need our camera man's gonna pan up here so that you can see that helicopter as we continue to talk [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=145.94s)]
*  All right [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=151.1s)]
*  I wanted to ask you about Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=151.57999999999998s)]
*  He apparently said I'm not gonna play the soundbite so we can see this video [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=153.57999999999998s)]
*  But he apparently said that tactical pauses are considered and have been considered [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=156.57999999999998s)]
*  Tactical pauses are considered and have been done and he said that [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=160.82s)]
*  We've had them before I suppose we'll check the circumstances in order to enable goods humanitarian goods to come in or our hostages [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=165.79999999999998s)]
*  Individual hostages to leave but I don't think there's going to be a general ceasefire [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=173.06s)]
*  Give you a chance to comment on that as we see this helicopter that you're showing us [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=177.22s)]
*  Yeah, look in that interview with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=183.45999999999998s)]
*  It was it was illuminating for a number of reasons and and two main reasons come to mind here [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=187.66s)]
*  First of all, he said there will be no ceasefire [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=193.86s)]
*  You may see a small pause in the fighting to allow more humanitarian aid to enter the Gaza Strip [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=196.10000000000002s)]
*  The Israelis understand they're facing Western pressure to make sure that those 2 million Palestinian civilians receive the much-needed [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=200.78s)]
*  Medical support and the aid that they are in need of as this war enters day 32 [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=207.9s)]
*  The other has to do with Netanyahu's comments about what will happen after the Israelis push deeper into Gaza [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=213.38s)]
*  He indicated for the first time that Israeli forces will stay for an unknown period of time inside the Gaza Strip [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=219.5s)]
*  They will occupy Gaza and this will be used to secure and stabilize the security situation on the ground [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=226.42s)]
*  But it raises new questions about how long Israel will stay and if they do have an exit strategy [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=232.7s)]
*  All right, Trey Yanks. Thank you. Be safe there [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V4EiYh40JA&t=238.82s)]
