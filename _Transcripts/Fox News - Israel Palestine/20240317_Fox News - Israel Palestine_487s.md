# GOP rep reveals an expected ‘turning point’ in the Israel-Hamas war
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [March 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0)
*  Joining me now, House Foreign Affairs Chair and Texas Congressman Michael McCaul. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=0.0s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=4.16s)]
*  Welcome back. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=5.16s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Shannon. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=6.16s)]
*  Let me first start by getting your reaction to that Chuck Schumer speech saying, time [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=7.16s)]
*  for new elections, Bibi standing in the way of peace, slumping him in with Hamas. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=9.68s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=13.88s)]
*  You heard what Admiral Kirby had to say. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=14.88s)]
*  Biden and Bibi have differences, but they can talk to each other. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=16.68s)]
*  But you know what I'm talking about? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  Toppling a government in a democracy. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=20.84s)]
*  That's what, you know, I was with the Ambassador Herzog from Israel at our retreat when this [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=24.12s)]
*  news came in and it was very inappropriate. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=29.3s)]
*  I think it was embarrassing. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=32.06s)]
*  You know, there's a way to talk about your differences, not to topple a government in [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=34.300000000000004s)]
*  a democratic country. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=39.42s)]
*  And I think, Shannon, it's indicative of now the split in the Democratic Party between [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=41.86s)]
*  the base, which is not in the traditional Israeli alliance anymore. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=46.94s)]
*  And I think what you're seeing is a pro-Palestinian, anti-Israel faction in the Democratic Party. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=52.540000000000006s)]
*  I know they protest Schumer outside his home every morning, and perhaps that's why he's [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=58.86s)]
*  responding this way. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=63.58s)]
*  But it's not a good sign because usually Israel's always been bipartisan. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=65.42s)]
*  Well, there are, you know, your Democratic colleagues, many of them raising questions [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=69.26s)]
*  about whether aid or weapons should be stopped. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=73.98s)]
*  There should be conditions on what flows into Israel. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=76.3s)]
*  And the president talked about this red line with regard to RAFA. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=78.58s)]
*  We do have a lot of sway over Israel. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=82.18s)]
*  So how much of that should we be using to make sure there is a concrete plan to protect [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=83.98s)]
*  civilians in Ra'aq? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=88.42s)]
*  Well, the aid has been more complicated because UNRWA, the UN refugee, you know, they were [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=89.42s)]
*  actually involved in the invasion of Israel. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=94.66s)]
*  So how can we have them deliver aid in Gaza? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=97.66s)]
*  There's no trust there. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=100.9s)]
*  So Israel is now getting private contractors to move the aid in. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=101.9s)]
*  We have the World Food Program, Catholic Relief Services, many NGOs that can deliver the aid [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=106.26s)]
*  if given the right security. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=113.58s)]
*  And I think we need to look at that model moving forward. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=114.58s)]
*  But should we be continuing to warn Israel that there could be limits on what we send [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=118.54s)]
*  or give if they proceed with this RAFA invasion? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=122.3s)]
*  My understanding, it's not going to be invasion. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=125.34s)]
*  It's going to be a continuation of targeting high-value targets in Ra'aq. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=128.1s)]
*  They've taken out half the leadership of Hamas. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=133.9s)]
*  Once they take out, you know, the top leadership, including this Yaya Senwar guy who's threatened [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=136.74s)]
*  to bomb Jerusalem during Ramadan, that is when you'll see a turning point. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=142.3s)]
*  I don't see anything wrong with doing that. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=148.42000000000002s)]
*  High-value targets in Ra'aq, not a full-fledged tanks rolling into Ra'aq. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=150.78s)]
*  OK, so let's talk about all of the funding that is sitting there in the supplemental, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=155.86s)]
*  some of it for Israel, Ukraine, Taiwan, other priorities. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=159.82000000000002s)]
*  You heard Admiral Kirby saying they want the full package, but there are other things being [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=163.14000000000001s)]
*  floated, possible standalone measures, possible loans or lend-lease. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=166.42000000000002s)]
*  The things that are potentially coming out of the House, the White House has signaled [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=172.1s)]
*  it really doesn't have any interest in. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=174.5s)]
*  So what can the House pass that the president would actually sign? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=175.78s)]
*  Well, the speaker indicated he's committed to getting this done. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=179.22s)]
*  You know, I've been working with the appropriate authorizers and appropriators. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=183.85999999999999s)]
*  There are things we can do to make this bill better. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=187.94s)]
*  For instance, the repo act, which I passed out of my committee, allows us to attach to [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=190.57999999999998s)]
*  the Russian sovereign assets have been frozen to help pay for Russia's war crimes. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=195.78s)]
*  I think most Americans agree with that concept. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=201.26000000000002s)]
*  Also, the loan program to provide for the direct government assistance to Ukraine. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=204.06s)]
*  It's not, you know, no interest, waivable, but it's symbolic that it is a loan program. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=210.02s)]
*  Finally, a strategy, and we've got to put these attack items in, the long-range artillery [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=216.54000000000002s)]
*  to hit the bridge between Russia and Crimea. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=221.94s)]
*  So do you think there's a chance still this comes through as a package? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=224.22s)]
*  There is still a chance that what the Senate has put into the House's court could come [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=227.02s)]
*  back out as a package, or you think it is going to be potentially broken up into other [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=231.42000000000002s)]
*  measures? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=234.78s)]
*  Well, I think we are moving through our normal appropriations process, should be done by [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=235.78s)]
*  this Friday, after which the speakers indicated he's committed to putting the supplement on [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=240.06s)]
*  the floor. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=245.86s)]
*  That would be Israel. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=246.86s)]
*  And we should attach Iran's sanctions to that. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=247.86s)]
*  That would be Ukraine and also Indo-Pacific. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=250.62s)]
*  Do you think we get this all done by Friday? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=253.58s)]
*  Because if not, it's government shutdown time. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=255.1s)]
*  And there's real concern, especially about the Department of Homeland Security portion [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=257.1s)]
*  of this and whether that gets passed. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=261.3s)]
*  You think they all get done by Friday? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=263.54s)]
*  I'm hopeful. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=265.21999999999997s)]
*  I do think we will. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=267.34s)]
*  The homeland piece, a little dicey. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=269.54s)]
*  Last resort, maybe a CR. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=272.34s)]
*  Just for that. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=274.54s)]
*  We could continue homeland on that basis. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=275.54s)]
*  However, we will get that done and we will move to the supplemental. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=277.9s)]
*  OK, I want to talk to you about Haiti because we are watching this violent, terrible situation [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=282.38s)]
*  deadly there unfolding. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=286.98s)]
*  Democrats are pointing the finger at Republicans over some of this. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=289.58000000000004s)]
*  The Democratic leader, Hakim Jeffries, over in the House, wrote a letter to the speaker [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=292.62s)]
*  this week. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=296.38s)]
*  By the way, he name-checked you in the letter and he says this, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=297.38s)]
*  Are Republicans responsible for what's happening in Haiti? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=312.78000000000003s)]
*  No, I think the administration's failed policies have led to what is happening in Haiti with [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=315.78000000000003s)]
*  no governance whatsoever, Shannon. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=322.26s)]
*  The prime ministers in Puerto Rico, even Kenya won't put their peacekeeping forces because [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=324.74s)]
*  it's so chaotic. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=330.54s)]
*  Now, what they're asking me to do is release $50 million of cash and weapons to go into [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=331.54s)]
*  Haiti with no governance. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=339.14s)]
*  And the worst thing we can do is arm the very warlords that threaten the people of Haiti. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=342.06s)]
*  So this guy named Barbecue, I don't want this to happen. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=348.5s)]
*  We have a history in this country of throwing weapons and guns into countries and they backfire. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=352.06s)]
*  Until I have assurances that the money can be accounted for and go to the right purpose, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=357.9s)]
*  I cannot in good conscience release that funding for the American taxpayer, but most importantly, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=363.82s)]
*  the Haitian people themselves. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=370.34s)]
*  Okay, so that stays on hold for now. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=371.82s)]
*  I want to make sure before you go that we talk about this hearing you're going to have [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=373.65999999999997s)]
*  this week, trying to get some answers and some accountability about the withdrawal from [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=376.1s)]
*  Afghanistan. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=379.98s)]
*  We all remember the horrible suicide bombing that took more than 100 lives, including 13 [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=381.08s)]
*  service members, American service members. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=386.21999999999997s)]
*  By the way, one of the fathers of the service member who was arrested last week at the City [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=389.18s)]
*  of the Union, I know you hosted, had a number of these families as guests. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=394.09999999999997s)]
*  He says charges are still pending against him. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=397.21999999999997s)]
*  Do you know if that's what's happening in that case? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=398.94s)]
*  They are. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=401.5s)]
*  I would recommend that he dropped. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=403.09999999999997s)]
*  This guy is Steve Nikoi, has been through so much. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=405.94s)]
*  He lost a son. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=410.46s)]
*  He's had a suicide death in his family. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=412.38s)]
*  All these families, these Gold Star families are grieving. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=415.41999999999996s)]
*  They feel that this president has never apologized to them or said, I'm sorry that your son [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=418.8s)]
*  and one daughter was killed by a suicide bomber. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=425.24s)]
*  We will hear from General McKenzie, the chairman of Joint Chiefs, General McKenzie, the sitcom [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=429.96000000000004s)]
*  commander about the White House and State Department's failures that brought about the [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=435.04s)]
*  conditions that led to the suicide bomber. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=441.76s)]
*  Do you think we'll get information from this hearing that we didn't previously have? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=444.52s)]
*  And the bottom line with the American people want to know is, is anyone then going to be held accountable? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=448.44s)]
*  Well, the one thing I would like is I want the DOD to provide the documents that the [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=453.96s)]
*  sniper testified to. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=459.52s)]
*  He said, I saw the suicide bomber. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=462.08s)]
*  It identified the Bolo beyond the lookout. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=464.7s)]
*  He sent the pictures over to the command center. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=467.62s)]
*  They've yet to produce these a year later. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=470.88s)]
*  And I'll be talking about that a lot at the hearing. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=474.0s)]
*  And by the way, General Milley and McKenzie agree with me that the DOD needs to turn over these documents. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=476.28s)]
*  Okay, we'll be watching this week. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=483.47999999999996s)]
*  Thanks, Shannon. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhOuQEk5W0&t=484.92s)]
