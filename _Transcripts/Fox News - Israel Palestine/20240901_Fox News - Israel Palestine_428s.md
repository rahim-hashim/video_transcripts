# The Biden admin withheld these weapons from Israel: GOP lawmaker
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [September 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ)
*  So did the Biden administration's pressure on Israel, including putting delays on arms [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=0.0s)]
*  shipments, embolden Hamas to kill the six innocent hostages? Republican Senator Tom Cotton says yes. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=5.76s)]
*  These hostages were discovered in the tunnels under Rafa. That's where Joe Biden and Kamala [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=13.84s)]
*  Harris put pressure on Israel not to enter for months, using arms embargo to try to keep them [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=18.8s)]
*  from entering. Just to be clear, there of course is no arms embargo. It is true that the Biden [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  administration did halt one shipment of arms out of concern. No, that's not correct. It is correct. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=28.72s)]
*  It was in place for many weeks. And of course, they have also argued that the US stands firmly [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=35.92s)]
*  behind Israel was one one-arm shipment. Kristen, you can do your fact check thing all you want. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=40.64s)]
*  I'm going to tell you the real facts. It was a large category of weapons far beyond just 2,000 [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=45.44s)]
*  pound bombs. Okay, just for the record, Joey, we'll start with you because in June, Senator [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=50.96s)]
*  Cotton wrote to President Biden about the administration withholding ammo and weapons. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=58.32s)]
*  And we can put that list up that he was talking about there with Kristen Welker. You got F-15s, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=64.24s)]
*  tactical vehicles. You have 120 millimeter mortars, 120 millimeter tank rounds, joint direct attack [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=69.68s)]
*  munitions, small diameter bombs. This is a detailed list and this isn't new information, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  I guess, is my point here. So the back and forth there, I found that exchange a little surprising. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=83.6s)]
*  Yeah, it really shows you sometimes where the media is playing for a team. And I don't understand, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=88.72s)]
*  always push back as a journalist, right? Always push back and say, well, actually, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=95.28s)]
*  and correct the record if there's a fact out there. But she had no evidence to say that, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=99.11999999999999s)]
*  oh, actually what she was doing is she was doing Kareem Jean-Pierre's job for her, probably a [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=102.96s)]
*  little bit better. When you look at that list that Tom Cotton's talking about, you know, some of that [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  stuff is pretty basic squad implemented stuff like a mortar round or an assault vehicle. But the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=112.16s)]
*  narrative that the administration was putting out to the public at that time was we're not going to [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=119.44s)]
*  send them these really big bombs because this is a civilian area. And so that alone, regardless if [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=123.2s)]
*  it was one shipment or over a period of months, that alone shows you how the administration was [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=128.16s)]
*  doing one thing and saying another. Lastly, I'll say two senators wrote on May 6th to the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=132.72s)]
*  administration. Tom Cotton wrote on June 20th and then Tom Cotton sent another letter, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=137.36s)]
*  another letter on August 2nd. So this obviously was happening for more than just one shipment [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=141.52s)]
*  or a few weeks. Yeah, very good point. You know, Nicole, the entire country has gotten to know [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=147.12s)]
*  Hersh's family and Hersh himself, an American now killed. And one of the hardest things, I think, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=154.56s)]
*  for so many people watching this is that not long before her son was killed, Hersh's mother [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=160.48s)]
*  was at the border there calling out and praying to her son. Let's take a listen. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=166.24s)]
*  Hersh, we are working day and night and we will never stop. I need you to know that I am giving [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=173.12s)]
*  you now the blessing I give you every single morning when I pray for you and every Friday night [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=184.4s)]
*  I go out on the porch and I put my hands up toward Gaza and I give you the Kohanic blessing. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=191.76s)]
*  May God bless you and keep you. May God shine his face upon you and be gracious to you. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=205.44s)]
*  Thank you. All we have right now is just hope that he heard those words. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=214.32s)]
*  You know, obviously this is devastating. I can't imagine what this mother is going through today, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=220.48s)]
*  but also what she's been going through since October 7th when her son was kidnapped. Her son [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=224.32s)]
*  is a year younger than my oldest son. I can't imagine. You know, the complexity of the situation [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=228.48s)]
*  is profound, but from a very basic level, an American has been murdered this weekend by a [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=234.4s)]
*  terrorist organization. We keep having these conversations about negotiations and ceasefires, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=239.04s)]
*  but when did the United States get back to a place where we negotiate with terrorists? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=244.48s)]
*  The U.S. policy towards Hamas needs to evolve in the sense that Gaza is going to need aid to rebuild. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=248.64s)]
*  Why are we saying we will give you hundreds of prisoners back? We will give you aid now. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=254.48s)]
*  Why don't we say you release these hostages right now or you get nothing. Put maximum pressure on [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=258.48s)]
*  Iran, on Turkey, on Qatar, on Yemen. Just like Trump and Mike Pompeo did, the United States needs [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=263.6s)]
*  to regain a strong footprint in the international stage. We are very weak and it is embarrassing and [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=269.12s)]
*  is devastating and people are dying because of it. You know, former President Trump was on with Mark [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=275.04s)]
*  Levin. He did an interview and he did address the situation in Israel with Hamas, but just to be [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=279.92s)]
*  clear, he did this before we found out about these six hostages. Take a listen. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=286.88s)]
*  How a Jewish person can vote for a Democrat, but specifically somebody like [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  Kamala. She wouldn't even meet with Bibi when he was, look, he came over, he's the Prime Minister [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=299.68s)]
*  of Israel. He's in a war. We're heavily invested in that war. People are dying. October 7th was a [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=305.6s)]
*  horrific day, just horrific. And now you see people that are picketing this thing. No such [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=312.24s)]
*  thing ever happened. You know, they did that with the Holocaust too. They said there was no Holocaust, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=317.36s)]
*  but this one was right next to us because we saw it. We saw it. You saw it. Everybody saw it. They [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=323.2s)]
*  saw it. I don't imagine they aren't thinking straight. Part two of Donald Trump's interview [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=327.92s)]
*  with Mark Levin airs tonight at 8 p.m. Eastern on Life, Liberty and Levin. And David, I want to [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=335.12s)]
*  bring you into this conversation because even though Hersh's parents said they weren't [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=340.88s)]
*  being political when they wanted the hostages released and something figured out, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=344.56s)]
*  this is going to travel on the campaign trail. Well, because there is an element of political, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=348.08s)]
*  because politics is a part of this. One administration or one sides view versus the [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=353.68s)]
*  other. First of all, this is an administration that couldn't show up and be there at Arlington [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=359.36s)]
*  with those Gold Star families for our Americans from the Abbey Gate. This is an administration [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=366.08s)]
*  that doesn't even speak to that. While Kamala Harris was in the Hamptons with the Clintons, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=370.88s)]
*  hosting a fundraiser that evening. That's where she was. Hersh Goldberg, by the way, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=375.2s)]
*  if you want to know, just in case you're not paying attention, the fact is his funeral is at [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=380.56s)]
*  4 p.m. tomorrow in Jerusalem. There is a time and place when they could show up. Will they show up [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=385.36s)]
*  tomorrow to pay respects for the families? No. They have a policy that doesn't work. Hamas gets, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=391.2s)]
*  doesn't get more prisoners. They get more soldiers. They get more fighters. And there is no way to [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=397.12s)]
*  deal with them in the multiple trips I've taken to Israel, the multiple briefings, the multiple [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=402.8s)]
*  assessments of this situation. There is no such thing as a two state solution. There is either [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=407.68s)]
*  victory or they will be back. Well, we're going to continue this conversation. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=412.8s)]
*  And catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis. You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEjaOUSH7OQ&t=421.2s)]
