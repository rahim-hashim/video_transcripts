# IDF releases new footage detailing Hamas' terror tunnels
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zOUZ9AfTjE)
*  I want to show you some new video now that's been released from the IDF and it gives a closer look at the tunnel system that runs through the Gaza Strip to transport weaponry and where the terrorist group is believed to be holding and you heard the new number now, 239 hostages. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zOUZ9AfTjE&t=0.0s)]
*  I want to bring in my friend, Brett Villicovich, Fox News contributor, drone expert, former Army Special Operations soldier. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zOUZ9AfTjE&t=16.0s)]
*  So good to have you on Outnumbered today, Brett. First of all, talk to us about those tunnels and really what the living is like down there for the hostages, what it would be like if they're there. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zOUZ9AfTjE&t=24.0s)]
*  Well, it's an extremely difficult scenario, Harris, you know, and the Israelis are looking at sending some of their most elite forces into these tunnels as they should. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zOUZ9AfTjE&t=35.0s)]
*  These are some of the most difficult fighting scenarios you can imagine, and the Israelis train relentlessly to go into these tunnels. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zOUZ9AfTjE&t=44.0s)]
*  They're like cities under there. The Hamas terrorist group, they smuggle men, money and material through them. They move cars, they move weapons, they move other equipment. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zOUZ9AfTjE&t=50.0s)]
*  They have oxygen and gas pumped into them. It's cities underneath there. And they're actually creating these tunnels even under civilian locations, under hospitals, under schools, which makes it even more dangerous. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zOUZ9AfTjE&t=58.0s)]
*  You know, but even someone like myself who comes from the special operations community, it isn't the real answer just to send in, you know, small elite troops. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zOUZ9AfTjE&t=68.0s)]
*  The real answer to stopping operations in these tunnels from occurring is to flood them. They should be horizontal, horizontally drilling into the tunnels from the Mediterranean Sea, from the surface of the Gaza border. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zOUZ9AfTjE&t=76.0s)]
*  They need to flood these so that the water makes it so they can't operate inside them. It's very bold. But that's the answer. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zOUZ9AfTjE&t=86.0s)]
*  And in lieu of that, you know, we need to help the Israelis do what we can with intelligence and surveillance from the air, whether that be drones or other means to help root out the terrorist groups that are operating from these tunnels. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zOUZ9AfTjE&t=93.0s)]
*  That bit of information that you just gave us sounds exactly why they would take our people and other countries people as hostages and put them in those tunnels. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zOUZ9AfTjE&t=103.0s)]
*  They know you can drill on those horizontal walls and flood the tunnels. They know that that would be operationally what they would probably do. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zOUZ9AfTjE&t=112.0s)]
*  But that's really helpful, Brett. So, I mean, this is the most difficult part of this. The number has gone all the way up to 300. You can't trust terrorists to tell you how many hostages they have. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zOUZ9AfTjE&t=121.0s)]
*  How is it that they can do these, you know, kind of short lived ground raids and get reconnaissance? Like, who would they be talking to at that point? The IDF? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zOUZ9AfTjE&t=131.0s)]
*  Well, they're talking to their intelligence assets that are above ground. That includes more than likely Western aerial assets that are flying over there. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zOUZ9AfTjE&t=142.0s)]
*  And we should do as much as we can from the air to provide the Israelis with this intelligence information, especially now that Hamas is holding American hostages. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zOUZ9AfTjE&t=151.0s)]
*  And I think this time when the Israelis commit forces into Gaza, it's going to be a lot different. It's going to be in waves from ground, sea and air. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zOUZ9AfTjE&t=159.0s)]
*  Israel isn't just going to go in there with all their forces at once. It's going to be in phases to play it out on the ground. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zOUZ9AfTjE&t=165.0s)]
*  They're going to go block by block. It's going to be very methodical and precise to root out Hamas once and for all. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zOUZ9AfTjE&t=170.0s)]
*  I'm sitting here in Tel Aviv, Israel, and there's a very tense feeling in the air. Everyone's in this state of constant readiness. Reservers have been called up. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zOUZ9AfTjE&t=175.0s)]
*  A lot of people in the streets and Kathy are armed. You're feeling that there's going to be this long protracted ground invasion and battle that's going to last months. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zOUZ9AfTjE&t=182.0s)]
*  And until you're here, you truly don't understand why it's so necessary for the Israelis to expunge the evil that is Hamas once and for all. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zOUZ9AfTjE&t=190.0s)]
*  And there is going to be collateral damage, unfortunately, because Hamas uses civilians in civilian locations like hospitals and schools as shields. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zOUZ9AfTjE&t=195.0s)]
*  And Israel, they're invading because of what occurred on October 7. They're not against Palestinians. They're against Hamas. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zOUZ9AfTjE&t=203.0s)]
*  Israelis have been living in this constant state of terror daily. It's very difficult environment. Just within the last 48 hours, we were under a number of rocket attacks near my location. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zOUZ9AfTjE&t=210.0s)]
*  And you can see what's just a normal day erupt into fear and violence. And so no one should have to live like this. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zOUZ9AfTjE&t=219.0s)]
*  Israelis shouldn't have to live like this under constant fear of terrorism, under constant fear of threat. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zOUZ9AfTjE&t=224.0s)]
*  And we need to do what we can to help them root that threat once and for all. So it doesn't happen to us. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zOUZ9AfTjE&t=229.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think about what we would do if this were happening along one of our borders. Oh, wait, we didn't secure the one in the south. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zOUZ9AfTjE&t=233.0s)]
*  Let's pray together about that situation. Brett Velikovitch, thank you very much. Good to see you. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zOUZ9AfTjE&t=239.0s)]
