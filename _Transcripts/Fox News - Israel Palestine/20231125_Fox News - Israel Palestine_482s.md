# Hamas to delay second release of hostages: Reuters
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o)
*  And again, we are getting breaking news that what we were expecting may be delayed for a while. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=0.0s)]
*  This is the second group of hostages held by Hamas that were due to be released today, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=6.48s)]
*  probably now will not happen today. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=12.52s)]
*  This, according to Reuters, quoting the armed wing of the Palestinian of Hamas, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=14.8s)]
*  said on Saturday it decided to delay the second round of hostage releases until Israel is committed [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  to letting aid trucks enter northern Gaza. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=27.48s)]
*  Now, again, we haven't confirmed it ourselves and we don't know exactly which aid trucks they're talking about, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=31.36s)]
*  whether or not they're allowed to be inspected. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=37.64s)]
*  And perhaps that's the reason they're having a problem accepting the terms of Hamas right now, Israel, that is. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  On the phone, we have Israeli Acting Consul General to New York Aviv Ezra. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=46.92s)]
*  Sir, thank you for joining us. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  What do you know, if anything, about this delay of the second group of hostages being released? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=53.96s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me, David. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=61.44s)]
*  Let me say this. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=64.28s)]
*  We this doesn't surprise Israel. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=65.36s)]
*  We're dealing with a brutal, murderous, vicious regime of terrorists. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=68.16s)]
*  And they have a history of violating ceasefires. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=72.84s)]
*  This is not the first time. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=75.68s)]
*  The last ceasefire that we had with them in the previous cycle, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=77.4s)]
*  They actually made two hours after the specific time to go after our soldiers, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  killing our soldiers and actually abducting one of their bodies. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=86.2s)]
*  We're talking also about an organization that plays psychological warfare against innocent civilians, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=89.56s)]
*  against the feeling of the families. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=95.64s)]
*  And we know that they cannot be trusted. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=97.76s)]
*  So as far as I'm concerned, the back and forth is that technically changing this point. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=100.2s)]
*  The mechanism that was agreed upon is not something that catches me as a surprise. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=106.44s)]
*  There's one thing that I do want to say about it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=110.88000000000001s)]
*  They will come back because the reason they came in originally to the deal is because [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=113.28s)]
*  they were under pressure and they were under military pressure. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=118.68s)]
*  And the fact that we were pushed for many weeks to restrain ourselves just proves the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=122.60000000000001s)]
*  indication that if we don't pressure them militarily, they will start playing these [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  unbelievable, unbelievable cruel playing of games against the families of innocent civilians. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=131.52s)]
*  You know, there's another thing that's happened, not only your military pressure, but also [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=139.92s)]
*  the pulling back of the curtain of what they had been doing in Gaza for Lord knows how [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=144.04s)]
*  many years. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=149.76s)]
*  The series of tunnels under hospitals and other civilian centers of Gaza, putting Palestinian [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=151.0s)]
*  civilians right in the harm's way of any counterattack by Israel. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=157.64s)]
*  Now we know that all the stories that we've been hearing about those civilian centers [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=162.64s)]
*  being the command centers of Hamas are true. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=168.64s)]
*  We sent in our own reporter, our own Trey Yngst went into those tunnels right under [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=171.72s)]
*  the hospital in Gaza that was essentially a command center of Hamas. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=177.88s)]
*  So all of their rhetoric, all of their propaganda was proved to be the lies that we suspected [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=183.79999999999998s)]
*  they were. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=188.88s)]
*  A hundred percent. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=189.88s)]
*  And for many years we've been getting these pushbacks saying, well, you can't prove it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=191.79999999999998s)]
*  You can't show us that this is the reality. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  And as you said, not that we just originally, just recently proved it through the media [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=198.6s)]
*  actually, it was also independently verified both by the White House and of course the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=204.04s)]
*  president himself. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=208.68s)]
*  We are talking about a terrorist organization that embodies themselves in civilians, specifically [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=210.16s)]
*  hiding behind civilians, going underneath hospitals, schools, mosques. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=216.52s)]
*  They do that because they know that our moral, the Jewish moral, the Israeli moral is not [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=223.56s)]
*  going after these locations. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=228.4s)]
*  This needs to be condemned by the international community. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=230.36s)]
*  I have yet to hear the UN saying that. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=233.6s)]
*  I have yet to hear other forces that are, I would say for many years, being focusing [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=235.96s)]
*  only on Israel. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=241.04s)]
*  And I think you mentioned very correctly in the previous segment that this is all Iranian [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=242.04s)]
*  fingerprints everywhere. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=247.96s)]
*  You can see it here in Hamas, you can see it in the Northern Front with Hezbollah, you [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=249.96s)]
*  can see it through the Houthis that are coming after us. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=254.24s)]
*  These are multi-fronts that Iran has been working and we need to make sure to continue [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=257.08s)]
*  the pressure on Iran too because they are the source of all of this. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=261.48s)]
*  Now let me ask specifically, get in the weeds a little about the ceasefire itself. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=264.40000000000003s)]
*  We've heard that the terms of the ceasefire, which apparently are in flux right now, but [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=268.8s)]
*  release of 10 hostages would allow for one extra day of a ceasefire. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=276.16s)]
*  When you count up the number of hostages that Hamas has control over, that would amount [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=284.24s)]
*  to a ceasefire of about a full month. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=289.08000000000004s)]
*  Wouldn't that give Hamas time to regroup and possibly eliminate the gains that Israel has [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=291.72s)]
*  made militarily? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=299.32000000000005s)]
*  The mechanism that we have crafted was a mechanism of the first four days in which 50 hostages [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=301.92s)]
*  will be released, and then every day further will be an additional 10 hostages. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=308.84000000000003s)]
*  However, I don't see the agreement continuing for 20 days, I don't see it continuing for [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=315.52000000000004s)]
*  two days very easily. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=321.92s)]
*  And I do want to make a very, very important point here. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=323.6s)]
*  There's no moral equivalence between the hostages that are being released from the Hamas group [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=327.12s)]
*  and the brutal regime and between the prisoners that we are exchanging. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=331.92s)]
*  Our people are not prisoners. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=335.88s)]
*  They are two years old, four years old, six years old, eight years old, mothers without [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=338.88s)]
*  children, children without mother. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=343.12s)]
*  Who takes a granny or a 10-month-old hostage? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=345.96s)]
*  On the other hand, we have to release these sometimes 15 years old, 50, sometimes women [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=349.56s)]
*  that have been convicted terrorists in attacks against Israelis. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=354.88s)]
*  Most of the time they didn't succeed, but they were violently attacking Israelis, stabbing, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=359.64000000000004s)]
*  throwing grenades, etc. at Israelis. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=364.72s)]
*  So we're talking about no moral equivalency, no doubt about that. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=367.6s)]
*  No, clearly there's no moral equivalency between a two-year-old and a Hamas fighter. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=371.12s)]
*  But specifically, just to re-ask the question, is it conceivable that you could lose a lot [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=377.72s)]
*  of the ground you've made against Hamas the longer this pause continues? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=384.86s)]
*  I wouldn't say that this is the best situation for the IDF at this point, but it's doable [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=391.86s)]
*  because we have defined two goals for this campaign that we're very well. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=400.98s)]
*  First of all, to eradicate Hamas and that goes into the future to make sure that they [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=404.38s)]
*  will not threaten us again. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=409.14s)]
*  The second, of course, is into looking with an eye to the past and making sure that all [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=410.7s)]
*  of our hostages will be released freely. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=415.9s)]
*  So these two goals are intertwined in a sense. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=419.14s)]
*  And I also want to talk about the fact that the major point of eradicating Hamas is not [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=422.94s)]
*  about vengeance, not about revenge. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=427.98s)]
*  It's about the sheer fact that if we would not eradicate Hamas as a military threat to [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=430.06s)]
*  We will not be able to bring hundreds of thousands of Israelis that are displaced now back to [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=435.5s)]
*  their communities in Kibbutzim because these murderous regimes could continue attacking [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=441.82s)]
*  Israel and they have said it out loud. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=447.38s)]
*  They're not shy about it. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=448.86s)]
*  They want to annihilate the state of Israel. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=450.38s)]
*  So at the end of the day, to your question, these two goals intertwined. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=452.14s)]
*  We're looking with an eye to the past to save all of our hostages, but with an eye to the [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=456.86s)]
*  future to eradicate their capabilities to go after us. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=460.46s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Israeli Acting Consul General in New York. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=464.5s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=466.82s)]
*  I appreciate you being here. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Q8b0lxd-o&t=467.82s)]
