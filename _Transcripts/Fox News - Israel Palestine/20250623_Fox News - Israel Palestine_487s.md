# The Iranian regime has ‘never been weaker’: Netanyahu advisor
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q)
*  Joining us now for our big close-up interview is International Affairs Advisor to Prime [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Minister Bibi Netanyahu, Caroline Glick. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=5.94s)]
*  It is great to have you with us. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  We certainly appreciate your time tonight. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=9.22s)]
*  A two-part question, Caroline. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=10.92s)]
*  Number one, how does the strike fundamentally alter the power dynamics in the Middle East? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=13.3s)]
*  And I guess the backup part of that question would be, could Iranian leaders finally accept [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=19.42s)]
*  the fact that they're not going to get a nuclear weapon? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=24.1s)]
*  Well, thanks. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=29.68s)]
*  That's a very important question. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=31.12s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Kevin. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=32.3s)]
*  This wasn't just a military operation, a joint U.S.-Israeli military operation. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=34.16s)]
*  It was a pivot point for civilizations' battle against barbarism. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=39.14s)]
*  And for 46 years, the Islamic regime in Iran has been making advances for barbarism, terrorism [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=44.3s)]
*  throughout the globe. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=51.92s)]
*  It built proxy armies all around Israel of its terror forces while building its nuclear [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=53.08s)]
*  weapons program and its ballistic missiles arsenal. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  And last night, when the U.S. joined the fight and destroyed Iran's three major nuclear installations, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=61.9s)]
*  civilization started massively turning back the clock and making a severe blow to barbarism [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=70.2s)]
*  on behalf of freedom in this world. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=78.22s)]
*  It's going to make a change for the better throughout the Middle East, for the entire [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=80.74s)]
*  Arab world, for Israel, and of course, for international security. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=85.83999999999999s)]
*  So this was perhaps the most meaningful, significant week since Israel started Operation Rising [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=89.78s)]
*  Lion on June 13th. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=98.28s)]
*  And then when the United States joined in yesterday, it was probably the most significant [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=100.08s)]
*  week strategically for the Middle East, perhaps even since 1979. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=105.17999999999999s)]
*  Wow, Caroline, thank you for joining us. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=110.56s)]
*  I'm Molly Lyne here. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=112.54s)]
*  As we mentioned earlier, President Trump has questioned why there shouldn't be regime change [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=114.54s)]
*  in Iran. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=119.88000000000001s)]
*  And Senator Lindsey Graham earlier today said that Israel is pushing for it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=120.88000000000001s)]
*  Watch. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=124.9s)]
*  So I talked to Bibi just a few minutes ago. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=125.9s)]
*  He wanted me to urge the Iranian people to end this madness, take this regime down and [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=128.98000000000002s)]
*  have a better life for yourselves. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=135.76s)]
*  And second, he wanted me to tell the American people Israel's not going to live this way [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=137.82s)]
*  anymore. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=142.44s)]
*  They're not going to live under threat from Iran anymore. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=143.44s)]
*  Now, there are a lot of reports that the Ayatollah is hiding in a bunker, that he has already [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=146.94s)]
*  picked his own potential replacement. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=152.28s)]
*  Caroline, is regime change, you know, a real possibility in Iran? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=154.94s)]
*  Look, I think what we've done, we have two goals for our operation. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=160.45999999999998s)]
*  One was to end the nuclear threat emanating from Iran by destroying its nuclear installations. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=165.62s)]
*  That's largely been concluded, both as a result of the work that we did since June 13th and, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=169.62s)]
*  of course, the incredible awesome strike that the United States carried out under President [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=173.98s)]
*  Donald Trump yesterday. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=178.78s)]
*  But the second one was taking out their ballistic missile arsenals and their capacity to build [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=181.04s)]
*  them, their industrial capacity to build them as well as their launchers. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=185.26s)]
*  And we're working very steadily towards accomplishing that goal as well quickly, much quicker than [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=188.74s)]
*  we thought we would be able to accomplish it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=193.22s)]
*  Those two missions are our missions. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=195.85999999999999s)]
*  But we believe that by accomplishing those missions, we're setting the conditions for [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=198.78s)]
*  the Iranian people to take up the mission that they actually took on themselves very [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=203.94s)]
*  early after the Islamic Revolution, which is to overthrow it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=209.3s)]
*  You know, we see every year or two thousands upon thousands of Iranians risking death and [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=212.5s)]
*  often dying in order to try to overthrow this regime. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=217.78s)]
*  And here we see the first time we have conditions that would enable them to do so. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=221.58s)]
*  It's not the point of Israel's operation, but it may well be a consequence. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=226.5s)]
*  And now with President Trump essentially saying that he supports the Iranian people, that [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=229.98000000000002s)]
*  may also give them the confidence to move forward. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=236.06s)]
*  There's a lot of repression right now by the Iranian regime. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=239.9s)]
*  They're arresting thousands of people for social media posts. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=245.66000000000003s)]
*  I know that they've arrested several foreigners to try to blackmail Western countries, and [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=250.06s)]
*  they want to execute political prisoners. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=259.1s)]
*  So when you look at these kinds of things, there's a lot of reason for Iranians to fear [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=260.9s)]
*  the regime today, just as they have for 46 years. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=265.54s)]
*  But I think that the conditions today as a result of the near accomplishment of both [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=269.26s)]
*  of the missions that we set out to accomplish, that the regime has never been weaker. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=273.14s)]
*  Caroline, as you very well know, the UN Security Council called an emergency meeting today [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=278.18s)]
*  in response to the strikes last night. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=281.66s)]
*  Usual actors, Russia and China, and even the UN Secretary General this time, used the opportunity [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=284.86s)]
*  to condemn the strikes. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=290.1s)]
*  Listen. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=291.5s)]
*  Russia condemns in the most decisive terms the irresponsible, dangerous and provocative [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=293.5s)]
*  actions committed by the USA. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=298.34000000000003s)]
*  The actions of the United States seriously violate the purposes and principles of the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=301.18s)]
*  UN Charter. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=305.46s)]
*  And the UN Secretary General, in his response, said that the United States should give peace [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=307.29999999999995s)]
*  a chance. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=312.29999999999995s)]
*  That call was not heeded. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=313.29999999999995s)]
*  You know, in short, what is Israel's response? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=316.29999999999995s)]
*  Is this more of the same? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=321.29999999999995s)]
*  Is it consequential at all? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=323.29999999999995s)]
*  Look, I mean, Antonio Guterres could barely even issue a serious condemnation of the October [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=326.29999999999995s)]
*  7th slaughter of our people in 2023. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=332.29999999999995s)]
*  And I mean, Iran to acquire nuclear weapons. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=335.14s)]
*  This is the best chance that peace has gotten. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=337.14s)]
*  Taking out Iran's nuclear installations, taking out the destroying their aspirations to become [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=340.14s)]
*  a nuclear armed state. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=345.14s)]
*  That's the best chance that peace has for breaking out in the Middle East and probably [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=347.14s)]
*  has had ever in the modern era. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=352.14s)]
*  So I would say that he has everything backwards. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=354.14s)]
*  And we're not surprised because the UN, particularly under Guterres, but we've seen it on, unfortunately, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=357.14s)]
*  in the perspective for decades, they always have everything backwards. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=362.97999999999996s)]
*  Caroline, Katie Palach here. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=364.97999999999996s)]
*  It's great to see you. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=366.97999999999996s)]
*  You know, the scenes of these direct hits of ballistic missiles in Tel Aviv and other [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=367.97999999999996s)]
*  parts of Israel are absolutely horrific. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=372.97999999999996s)]
*  That continues. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=375.97999999999996s)]
*  We saw the retaliation last night after the strikes on the nuclear sites by the U.S. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=376.97999999999996s)]
*  So what is Israel's plan now in terms of keeping up the fight against Iran? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=381.97999999999996s)]
*  And what is the strategy moving forward to keep the pressure on them so that you're not [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=386.97999999999996s)]
*  able to see any of those scenes inside of Israel? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=392.82s)]
*  Well, we've been, like I said, one of the two objectives is to destroy their ballistic [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=395.82s)]
*  missile program, not just their arsenal, but their industrial capacity. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=400.82s)]
*  And also, most importantly, from the perspective of the footage that you're seeing from Tel [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=404.82s)]
*  Aviv and throughout the country of the destruction that they're causing with these ballistic [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=408.82s)]
*  missiles is also to go after the launchers. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=414.82s)]
*  Because if they don't have launchers, they can't launch the missiles. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=416.82s)]
*  So we've gotten a very large chunk of their launchers taken out, destroyed, and we're [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=419.65999999999997s)]
*  continuing to hunt them down and destroy them sometimes with missiles already attached to [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=423.65999999999997s)]
*  them and about to launch to Israel. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=428.65999999999997s)]
*  Sometimes we just see them on the trucks that are moving them around and we bomb them that [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0ufkH8n7Q&t=430.65999999999997s)]
