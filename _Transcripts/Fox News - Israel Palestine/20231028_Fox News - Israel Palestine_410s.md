# ‘VERY CONCERNED’: This has ‘a lot to do’ with oil, former US gen warns
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4)
*  Let's bring in General Anthony Tata, retired U.S. Army Brigadier General. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=0.0s)]
*  General, thanks for being here. You heard Greg's report. You know, there's only been a trickle of [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=3.68s)]
*  hostages released, and I've heard some reports that because they've come to loggerheads in those [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  negotiations over hostages, Israel feels like a ground offensive might not restart the talks, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=12.88s)]
*  but create different leverage. What dynamic do you think hostages have to play with the timing of [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=18.96s)]
*  this, and what do you see coming next? Hey Pete, good morning to the team there. I [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  think hostages are central to all of this because that's why Hamas took the hostages so they could [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=29.36s)]
*  be bargaining chips. Think about the perverse logic there, doling the hostages back and then [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  for trying to make the world think that they're good people. So what Israel has been doing for [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  the last couple of weeks is planning and setting the conditions for their larger offensive, and [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=48.72s)]
*  they have an ultimate goal to destroy Hamas, and so they are reverse engineering their plans from [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=56.0s)]
*  that ultimate goal, which includes all the logistical preparation, as you know, to get [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=63.52s)]
*  forces into place, to be able to gather all the intelligence that they need to develop the plans [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=69.92s)]
*  to very surgically go in and destroy command and control cells and logistics cells that Hamas has [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=77.92s)]
*  they've got the tunnels, they've got the rubble, they've got the high rises, and so it's a three [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=85.84s)]
*  dimensional battlefield, and the planning takes time, and the positioning of all these forces [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=90.0s)]
*  and logistics takes time, and so they are set there in their three-point stance, they've done [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=95.2s)]
*  some probing attacks that come in from the sea, and what they are trying to do is change the narrative [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=100.4s)]
*  and put pressure on Hamas as opposed to all the international pressure being on the IDF in Israel. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=107.68s)]
*  You know, General, it's interesting analogy there in their three-point stance. I think before this [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=116.48s)]
*  incident I would have assumed that Israel had all the intelligence and readiness to execute a plan [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=120.8s)]
*  like this at a moment's notice, that they wouldn't be starting from scratch, and forgive my ignorance, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=125.92s)]
*  I wouldn't know that it would take three weeks to be ready. The great variable seems to be the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=130.72s)]
*  hostages, and I said I would have, real quick, General, I would have said, the reason I said I [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=134.32s)]
*  would have said this before, but I also would have assumed that the Israeli intelligence wouldn't have [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=139.04s)]
*  missed this initial terrorist attack as well. So now I'm not sure what the level of readiness. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=143.44s)]
*  Well, I think that's a very good point. I think they were caught off guard for whatever reason. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  Lots of intelligence agencies have missed lots of big things in the last couple of years with [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=156.88s)]
*  Afghanistan and Russia and Ukraine, and now this, and even our border. I feel like that hadn't come [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=161.44s)]
*  home to Russia yet, but as Israel gets ready to put their flesh and blood in harm's way, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=168.88s)]
*  I think that they want to make sure they don't miss anything, fool me once, shame on you, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  fool me twice, shame on me, and I think they want to make sure that they aren't fooled twice, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=182.56s)]
*  and so they're trying to be as very, as careful as possible about protecting the force protection of [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=187.92s)]
*  their own troops, the force protection of the civilians, the force protection of the hostages, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=195.76s)]
*  and then being ruthless and brutal with the Hamas terrorists that are holing up amongst all these [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=201.44s)]
*  civilians, and so it's a real complex problem to prosecute an offensive operation where you're [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  having to identify friend or foe, whether it's a four-man stack going into a building or dropping [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=214.39999999999998s)]
*  a J-DAM somewhere, that you want to make sure that you're not harming civilians to the largest [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=221.44s)]
*  extent possible. General, how worried are you that we as a country are going to be drawn into a larger [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=228.56s)]
*  regional conflict, and what that means for us considering that we also have a war in Ukraine [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=236.08s)]
*  that we're almost bankrupt. There's a lot of concerns out there, and the oil since our president [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=242.24s)]
*  has declared war on American energy. At this time, we're kind of dependent on the oil in this region. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=249.04s)]
*  Yeah, Rachel, that's a great point. You know, the first thing the president should have done, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=255.2s)]
*  I don't know, two and a half years ago is continue the Trump era oil policies, and certainly he could [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=260.32s)]
*  open up all the permits, approve all the permits and all that, because this has a lot to do with [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=268.4s)]
*  oil. That region has less to do with U.S. national security if we are energy independent, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=272.88s)]
*  which we are not now. So that's an excellent point. I am very concerned that this, we could [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=282.32s)]
*  get drawn into a larger conflict, because what's happened is Russia, China, Iran, North Korea have [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=288.71999999999997s)]
*  all witnessed with their own eyes American weakness on a grand scale, and sort of a keystone [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=295.28s)]
*  cop with this administration. You know, you got Jake Sullivan writing a foreign affairs [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=302.0s)]
*  magazine article saying the Middle East has never been more peaceful, and it comes out the week before [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=307.52s)]
*  all of this happens, and touting their relationship with Iran and all that. And they've been fooled. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=315.2s)]
*  They're wrong. You know, the Gates' comment that Joe Biden's been wrong on every major foreign policy [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=321.44s)]
*  decision he's ever made is accurate. And you know, it's Afghanistan, it's Russia, Ukraine. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=329.52s)]
*  Remember, they offered Zelensky a ride out on the night of the invasion, and now they've missed this. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=334.8s)]
*  And I'm really worried about our border and the intelligence because of the focus on, you know, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=340.8s)]
*  PTA moms and Catholics and that kind of thing. They're not focused on national security threats [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=345.92s)]
*  for Americans. And so when we think about what's happening with Iran and how we're going to try to [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=351.28s)]
*  separate them from this equation that give Israel and the IDF the breathing room to do what they need [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=359.52s)]
*  to do, there's really poor decision-making with this administration, and their instincts so far [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=365.52s)]
*  have seemed way off base. Because just think about it. Just a few days ago, they were equivocating on [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=373.67999999999995s)]
*  Hamas, and they were supportive of not mentioning Iran. Finally, they changed their tune. They must [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=380.88s)]
*  have done a poll. I'm not sure. But now they are saying Hamas is bad and Iran's fingerprints are on [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=387.04s)]
*  this. Great place to leave it. General Tata, thank you for your time. Good stuff. I'm Steve [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jYxVtduF4&t=393.68s)]
