# BREAKING: Hamas releases last living American hostage from Gaza
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE)
*  Okay, so we are covering this breaking news, and President Trump is about to head out on [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=0.0s)]
*  the first Middle East trip of his second term. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=7.12s)]
*  So likely, oh we pray, when Adon Alexander is freed, he's not off the ground yet. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=9.6s)]
*  He got word. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  We just got word too. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  Adon Alexander has just been freed. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=19.44s)]
*  That Red Cross group that was heading to the Handover Point has just reached it, and they [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=21.44s)]
*  are hands-on at this point. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=26.88s)]
*  This is news for the world. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=29.68s)]
*  This is news that was brought about by an American president to bring an American home. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=31.6s)]
*  We do not leave ours behind. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=36.26s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=39.92s)]
*  Senior Foreign Affairs correspondent Greg Palcott. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=41.6s)]
*  I am teared up at this point. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  I mean this, this is critical. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=45.96s)]
*  This is critical. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=48.54s)]
*  I know you're in Tel Aviv, Greg. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=49.54s)]
*  It's big news, Harris, absolutely. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=53.74s)]
*  We do now have confirmation that Adon Alexander, that 21-year-old native of Teneflay, New [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=56.08s)]
*  Jersey, is out of the ugly hands of Hamas and back in safety in the West. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=64.16s)]
*  What we're watching on several monitors here is the transfer which has just happened. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=72.12s)]
*  It started in the Khan Unis. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=78.68s)]
*  That's a town in Gaza. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=80.75999999999999s)]
*  That is where Hamas brought the 21-year-old, and then they transferred him over to a set [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=83.88000000000001s)]
*  of Red Cross vehicles. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=92.68s)]
*  The Red Cross vehicles have left Gaza at least at that point, and now we are waiting on the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=95.36s)]
*  next stage, Harris. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=102.4s)]
*  That is Adon Alexander being moved from a Red Cross vehicle to an IDF, to an Israeli [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=104.74000000000001s)]
*  military vehicle where he will be brought to a nearby base for basically the first check. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=111.52s)]
*  I got to underscore this, Harris. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=118.6s)]
*  We have not seen him yet. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=121.84s)]
*  We have heard he is in good condition. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=123.8s)]
*  We have not seen the transfer. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=126.39999999999999s)]
*  We have been told that Hamas was going to play this low, low key. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=128.2s)]
*  They didn't want a big show. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=133.07999999999998s)]
*  They didn't want to insult the U.S., which has been very much deeply involved in this negotiation. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=135.08s)]
*  So our visuals are not as good as in past hostage handovers, but we do have the word [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=143.84s)]
*  that he has gone out of Hamas' captivity. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=151.72000000000003s)]
*  He is in the Red Cross vehicles. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  They are being brought to the Israeli military. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=157.76000000000002s)]
*  Let me give you just a brief backgrounder on this man. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=160.96s)]
*  21-year-old Adon Alexander. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=164.48s)]
*  He was held for 19 months by Hamas. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=167.72s)]
*  He has been, had been, it's nice to say that now, he had been the last living American [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=171.56s)]
*  held by the terror group. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=178.88s)]
*  He was born in Teneflon, New Jersey, of Israeli parents. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=180.28s)]
*  The dual national American-Israeli left the U.S. when he was 18. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=184.4s)]
*  He wanted to sign up as a soldier, the IDF. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=188.32s)]
*  This was before October 7th happened. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=191.48s)]
*  He was on the Gaza border on that fateful day, abducted by Hamas. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=194.35999999999999s)]
*  His release has been brokered through very, very unusual talks, direct talks happening [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=200.32s)]
*  between the U.S. and Hamas with Steve Witkoff, the special envoy involved. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=207.52s)]
*  There were intermediaries involved too, but we can call those talks direct, and that's [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=213.04s)]
*  very important. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=218.6s)]
*  What happens now, Harris, is Alexander, after he will be checked out at this base just outside [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=219.64s)]
*  of Gaza, will be flown up here to Tel Aviv to yet another hospital where he will be checked [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=227.4s)]
*  out further. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=233.28s)]
*  Important thing to say about that first stop, though, at the Israeli military down south, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=234.28s)]
*  he will meet his mother who's been flown there. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=238.95999999999998s)]
*  He'll also be met by a few U.S. officials, including Bolin, the envoy involved with hostages. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=242.4s)]
*  And Witkoff, who was flown down there for that very reason. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=249.6s)]
*  So now we're looking at a country that is watching this, but also anxious about the [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=255.08s)]
*  remaining 58 hostages, including, it's believed, 20 alive. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=261.6s)]
*  One last word from President Trump, who posted and talked about it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=267.6s)]
*  He is very happy. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=272.28s)]
*  It's great news. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=273.6s)]
*  And the U.S. played a major part back to you. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=274.84000000000003s)]
*  Oh, Greg, you mentioned one country. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=277.8s)]
*  There are two countries on our screen right now. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=280.40000000000003s)]
*  There's Tel Aviv, Israel, where his mother is waiting to have her in her arms again, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=282.72s)]
*  have him in her arms again, and Teneflon, New Jersey, which they call home. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=288.48s)]
*  The Jewish Community Center there on the Palisades has kept watch and prayer and so much hope [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=294.96000000000004s)]
*  for 584 days. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=302.6s)]
*  When you walk into that center, there is almost a life-size poster of his face. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=304.4s)]
*  You cannot forget Adon Alexander and all of the rest of the hostages on walls as you walk [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=311.71999999999997s)]
*  through that JCC in Teneflon, keeping everyone in mind. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=318.28s)]
*  Now Greg Polkop, we want to thank. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=322.96s)]
*  And he said that the next move for Adon Alexander is to be moved from the Red Cross facility [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=325.03999999999996s)]
*  and be turned into IDF, the Israeli Defense Force, and their military care on a base. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=332.48s)]
*  I want to bring in now Republican Congressman Brian Mass to Florida, Foreign Affairs Committee [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=338.59999999999997s)]
*  Chairman. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=342.96s)]
*  He is also a retired U.S. Army Staff Sergeant and former volunteer with the Israeli Defense [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=343.96s)]
*  Forces, the IDF. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=349.24s)]
*  You and I have talked about a day like today, and now it has happened for this family. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=351.2s)]
*  First of all, your thoughts about where he's now going. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=357.03999999999996s)]
*  Yes, so just one, thank God. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=361.52s)]
*  Thank you, President Trump. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=363.92s)]
*  Thank you, Steve Witkoff, all for their participation in getting him home. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=365.0s)]
*  Undoubtedly, as was pointed out, he's going to go receive whatever immediate trauma he [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=369.04s)]
*  might need, assessments on his medical care. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=373.16s)]
*  There has been conversation about whether after his health is assessed, will he follow [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=376.04s)]
*  on and meet the president where the president is going to speak with Saudi Arabia, Qatar, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=380.52s)]
*  and UAE, where undoubtedly there will be many high-level discussions about what's [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=385.8s)]
*  going on between Israel and Gaza, the future of Abraham Accords, and if his health allowed [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=390.48s)]
*  it, I think there would be hard press to find a more important presence that you could see [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=395.28000000000003s)]
*  take place there. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=400.28000000000003s)]
*  Talk to me about the visuals that we see on the screen, Tel Aviv and Teneflay, and of [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=402.32s)]
*  course a photo of Adon Alexander in the bottom right corner as we await to hear more word [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=408.2s)]
*  about how he's doing now that he's free. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=413.8s)]
*  These are communities and the rest of the world too that have prayed with such a backdrop [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=416.72s)]
*  of Jewish hate in this country, and it is hard to talk about the love we see on the [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=422.04s)]
*  screen and the homecoming knowing that there is so much of it already at home here. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=426.2s)]
*  Harris, you pointed out accurately, we have a president that believes we don't leave our [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=432.0s)]
*  people behind, and this administration has been fighting every single day to make sure [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=437.24s)]
*  that's not just words for America, but that is the policy that we live up to. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=442.4s)]
*  And I can tell you for all of the families and the loved ones and just the citizens that [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=446.36s)]
*  you see on the screen, these people have been in and out of Washington, D.C., meeting with [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=450.52s)]
*  myself, meeting with the administration, meeting with other representatives, always making [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=454.8s)]
*  sure that it is top of mind that there are individuals being held, that they are still [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=459.08s)]
*  being tortured, that they are being starved, the conditions that they're in, that there [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=463.22s)]
*  are bodies being held, they are making sure day in, day out that it has been top of mind, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=466.76s)]
*  and they get a lot of credit in this fight, too, as well, for just maintaining that hope [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=470.94s)]
*  and maintaining that they will keep it forefront for everybody to be thinking about. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=474.5s)]
*  And so the joy that they must be going through to see this pedantic drumbeat of victories [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=480.1s)]
*  coming through, another person returned, another person returned, it just gives more hope to [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=485.64s)]
*  those that still remain. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=490.3s)]
*  Oh, that is so beautifully put and so hopeful. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=492.18s)]
*  You're right. The job is not done yet. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=494.58s)]
*  The total job is not done yet. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=497.1s)]
*  In fact, it comes with a deadline for a ceasefire this Thursday, May 15th. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=498.62s)]
*  You know, you fought alongside those members of the IDF. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=502.78000000000003s)]
*  What are they facing at this point? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=506.54s)]
*  And does Hamas even have a clue how fast they need to move now? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=508.14s)]
*  You face in Israel right now that's prepared to go in with the full the full violence of [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=513.34s)]
*  action that they can produce to say, listen, we want everybody returned. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=519.54s)]
*  We want everybody returned. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=523.82s)]
*  We want every terrorist from the area gone, every stronghold that you've had as a terrorist [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=525.66s)]
*  stronghold where you've launched operations, they come to an end. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=530.86s)]
*  There will be no future for any of this going forward. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=533.58s)]
*  And they will bring the full weight of every power that they can to make sure that that is [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=536.86s)]
*  the conclusion. And I think that's what you have going forward for the Israeli military [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=541.34s)]
*  right now. There's again, we're celebrating this hope today that we have because of the [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=545.7s)]
*  return of an American Israeli. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=550.02s)]
*  But again, there are those that remain in those bodies that remain and there's still an [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=552.74s)]
*  ongoing conflict that has to be dealt with. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=556.82s)]
*  And everybody recognizes that. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=558.7800000000001s)]
*  And those families deserve answers. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=560.3000000000001s)]
*  They deserve to know what has happened and if there are living among them that we may [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=562.58s)]
*  not even know of. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=568.4200000000001s)]
*  Congressman Nass, I'm going to ask you to stand by and listen in if you can, because we [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=569.9s)]
*  have now a guest on the phone, Sue Gelsey. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=574.94s)]
*  She is the interim CEO of the Kaplan Jewish Community Center in New Jersey. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=579.3000000000001s)]
*  And I don't know if she can hear me. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=585.14s)]
*  I can hear you. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=588.7s)]
*  You're there. All right. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=589.4200000000001s)]
*  First of all, I can only imagine what it looks like. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=590.4200000000001s)]
*  I know you had the Rubin run yesterday. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=592.94s)]
*  The place was packed. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=594.54s)]
*  And so all those people had to do was just stay in their lawn chairs at this point. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=595.86s)]
*  What is it like at the JCC and Tenafly on the Palisades? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=599.74s)]
*  Thanks for asking. I will say we're actually downtown Tenafly right now. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=605.26s)]
*  And there's about three thousand people, I'm estimating, have gathered, many of whom [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=608.46s)]
*  have been here since 5 a.m. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=613.14s)]
*  before the sun came up, hoping to see what we're about to see. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=615.4200000000001s)]
*  The first glimpse to be done and his family as reuniting after a long, long period of [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=619.58s)]
*  waiting. Look, I have read and I know that members of his family belonged. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=627.1800000000001s)]
*  Can you fill us in a little bit about what's been going on to support this family and [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=633.26s)]
*  how maybe just tell us anything about them? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=637.98s)]
*  Yeah, and they're a wonderful family. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=641.26s)]
*  I mean, in Tenafly, we have a large Israeli-American population. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=642.82s)]
*  They're among them. They've been members of the JCC for many, many years. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=646.46s)]
*  Idan and his siblings were part of our swim team, participated in after school activities, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=651.54s)]
*  joined us on Sundays for basketball and other activities. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=656.82s)]
*  And we're also part of the vibrant Israeli-American community at the JCC, participating [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=660.86s)]
*  in holiday events and so on. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=665.34s)]
*  They're a wonderful family and they're great citizens of Tenafly, the entire town of [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=667.4599999999999s)]
*  Tenafly. The mayor is here. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=671.3399999999999s)]
*  The lieutenant governor is here. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=672.5799999999999s)]
*  Congressman Gottheimer is here. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=674.14s)]
*  People are rallying because this family was all of us. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=676.22s)]
*  This family is all of us. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=680.1s)]
*  Yes. It sounds like you have known Idan Alexander since he was much younger than what he [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=682.3399999999999s)]
*  is now, playing in sports. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=687.5s)]
*  And so tell us about the young man that you remember and no doubt you'll see that family [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=690.14s)]
*  at some point. What you want to say to them? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=695.2199999999999s)]
*  We just want to say we we are here with you and for you all the time. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=698.62s)]
*  They know that they've been we've been really well connected with them over the last year [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=702.9399999999999s)]
*  and a half. We had a gathering immediately after October 7th before we really knew the [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=706.9799999999999s)]
*  the the fate of Idan. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=712.4599999999999s)]
*  We later had a gathering with the family for the family where David Broza performed at [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=714.9799999999999s)]
*  the one anniversary of October 7th. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=720.38s)]
*  We had four thousand people gather at the JCC and Yael was one of our speakers and the [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=722.7s)]
*  whole community embraced her and their whole family. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=728.98s)]
*  And we just want to say we're waiting for Idan and the whole family to come back to [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=732.74s)]
*  to home in Tenafly. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=738.14s)]
*  Sue Gelsie, thank you for joining us. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=739.74s)]
*  I know this is a jubilant time. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=741.86s)]
*  It's also one of reflection on those who remain in captivity, perhaps living. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=743.7800000000001s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=749.78s)]
*  But as a total, total community, as Americans now, we are with you. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1E2emHqEE&t=751.46s)]
