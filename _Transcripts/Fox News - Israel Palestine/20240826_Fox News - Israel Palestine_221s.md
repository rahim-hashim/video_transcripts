# America needs to understand ‘who is behind’ these Hezbollah attacks: Gen Keane
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [August 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIw4HXJjeM)
*  And General Jack Keene is here with us. General, we are awaiting President Trump at Arlington [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIw4HXJjeM&t=0.0s)]
*  National Cemetery. We might have to cut to that in the meantime. Of course, we will ask [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIw4HXJjeM&t=5.76s)]
*  you about that as well. But in the meantime, can you tell us about your thoughts regarding [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIw4HXJjeM&t=10.14s)]
*  America's help to Israel over the weekend to thwart those attacks? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIw4HXJjeM&t=14.76s)]
*  Yeah, well, certainly we've seen two major retaliation attacks, one by Iran, obviously [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIw4HXJjeM&t=19.72s)]
*  on October 13th and one just recently by Hezbollah this weekend, both for the same reason, you [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIw4HXJjeM&t=26.64s)]
*  know, to retaliate for Israel killing significant leaders. And in both of those, the United [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIw4HXJjeM&t=33.04s)]
*  States obviously had a hand. In the first one, U.S.-led coalition intercepted many of [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIw4HXJjeM&t=38.92s)]
*  the drones and missiles used in aircraft and Navy ships to do it, in addition to that, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIw4HXJjeM&t=44.72s)]
*  intelligence. And on this one, the United States provided intelligence in terms of early [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIw4HXJjeM&t=49.6s)]
*  warning, as did the Israelis' systems themselves. And that really turned out to be quite significant [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIw4HXJjeM&t=54.0s)]
*  because it enabled them to conduct a preemptive strike to take down literally two-thirds of [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIw4HXJjeM&t=61.4s)]
*  the systems that would have been involved in Hezbollah's attack. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIw4HXJjeM&t=67.04s)]
*  So Israel has displayed an upper hand in both of these retaliation attacks, one by Iran [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIw4HXJjeM&t=70.84s)]
*  and one by Hezbollah, as the results are inconsequential, certainly. But both of them take credit for [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIw4HXJjeM&t=77.08s)]
*  it. And both Iran and looks like Hezbollah is de-escalating as a result of it. So that's [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIw4HXJjeM&t=83.56s)]
*  obviously a good outcome from what could potentially have been something disastrous. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIw4HXJjeM&t=90.08000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, in general, obviously the strike takes out that threat, at least temporarily, from [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIw4HXJjeM&t=95.32000000000001s)]
*  Hezbollah. But we didn't see Iran really live up to its retaliation claims. And Israel is [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIw4HXJjeM&t=100.72s)]
*  just preemptively trying to protect itself in both of these cases. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIw4HXJjeM&t=108.44s)]
*  The Iranians are still promising to retaliate for the killing of Hanayah, obviously in Tehran, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIw4HXJjeM&t=116.36s)]
*  in a high-security zone. But interesting enough, this has been a promise for weeks now, and [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIw4HXJjeM&t=123.72s)]
*  they are clearly prioritizing this ceasefire negotiations that are taking place, leading [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIw4HXJjeM&t=131.72s)]
*  hopefully to hostages being released and a prisoner exchange. That obviously is their [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIw4HXJjeM&t=138.36s)]
*  priority. And I think that is interesting of itself. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIw4HXJjeM&t=143.64s)]
*  I've always had the suspicions in the back of my mind that Iran, given the last inconsequential [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIw4HXJjeM&t=147.56s)]
*  attack and how humiliating it was for them to undergo that, because half of their ballistic [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIw4HXJjeM&t=153.72s)]
*  missile systems failed, that I think with some reluctance they're going to retaliate. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIw4HXJjeM&t=160.16s)]
*  And if they can get this deal done, they would take that certainly, as opposed to the possibility [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIw4HXJjeM&t=166.32s)]
*  of another humiliating defeat. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIw4HXJjeM&t=171.66s)]
*  But look it, Iran is the kingpin here. They are driving everything. Hezbollah's retaliation [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIw4HXJjeM&t=173.6s)]
*  attack doesn't happen without Iran green-lighting that attack this weekend. So let's make sure [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIw4HXJjeM&t=179.48s)]
*  we understand who is behind what is taking place here in the Middle East. And the frustration [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIw4HXJjeM&t=186.76s)]
*  many of us have with the administration, a lot of emphasis on de-escalation, but not [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIw4HXJjeM&t=193.07999999999998s)]
*  much emphasis on really pinning the rose on Iran and enforcing deterrence on them in terms [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIw4HXJjeM&t=197.79999999999998s)]
*  of operationalizing and continue to operationalize their proxies against Israel. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIw4HXJjeM&t=205.64s)]
*  And a successful defense does not mean that they don't get to think about retaliation [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIw4HXJjeM&t=212.48s)]
*  from the Israeli side. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIw4HXJjeM&t=215.84s)]
*  General, I want to take everybody here now to national... [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjIw4HXJjeM&t=217.44s)]
