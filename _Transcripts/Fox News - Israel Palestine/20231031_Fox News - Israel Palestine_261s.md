# Biden in trouble with his radical base
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE)
*  Joining me now is Victor Davis-Hansen, Hoover Institution's senior fellow, Victor. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=0.0s)]
*  There's an opportunity that Republicans, I think, need to take advantage of here, as [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=5.76s)]
*  Biden sees his own base turning against him. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=11.6s)]
*  But you see there is a push to lurch back to the establishment and the pro-war coalition [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=16.0s)]
*  of the Republican Party as well. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=21.38s)]
*  Yeah, I think Kamala Harris had it absolutely backwards. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=24.0s)]
*  All these issues, the border, the trans issue with biological males competing in women's [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=28.16s)]
*  sports, inflation, they all offend inner-city blacks, Hispanics, and now they've alienated [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=34.92s)]
*  over the Israel question, the Jewish community. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=42.86s)]
*  And they can get away with this, Laura, historically, when they have a hard left base and they can [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=47.24s)]
*  veneer it over with a very rhetorical, malevolent Barack Obama or Bill Clinton, they can get [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=53.04s)]
*  away with it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=59.0s)]
*  But otherwise, when they have a George McGovern or Jimmy Carter, it doesn't work, and that [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=60.0s)]
*  left becomes more pronounced. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=65.64s)]
*  And that's what Joe Biden is. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=67.8s)]
*  He's a force multiplier because of his cognitive problems and really his meanness, his corruption [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=68.96s)]
*  problems. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=74.72s)]
*  He's a force multiplier of this division. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=75.72s)]
*  And we're starting to see now this—Gaza really tore this scab off, and we're seeing [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=77.72s)]
*  a putrid wound of what the Democratic Party is. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=82.38s)]
*  It's pro—the base is—let's face it, it's pro-Hamas, it's pro-open borders, it's pro-ban [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=85.5s)]
*  gas engines and natural gas stoves. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=92.78s)]
*  And that doesn't appeal to middle-class people. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  It only appeals to the very wealthy bicoastal elite and the subsidized poor. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=98.53999999999999s)]
*  And they have a real problem because they can't paper it over with a guy like Joe Biden. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=103.38s)]
*  He's, as I said, Jimmy Carter and George McGovern redux. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=106.86s)]
*  So it gives enormous opportunity for a populist Republican Party to appeal to these disaffected [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=111.48s)]
*  voters. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=117.39999999999999s)]
*  And if they can unite around a candidate that can do that, they'll win, and they'll win [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  overwhelmingly. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=122.28s)]
*  Well, over at MSNBC, you'll be shocked to know, Victor, that the elites from the Council [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=123.28s)]
*  on Foreign Relations, those types, they're panicking that America actually might move [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=129.74s)]
*  back to focusing on America first. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=135.06s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=137.36s)]
*  We've gone from America first under Donald Trump to alliance first under Joe Biden. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=138.52s)]
*  This is a partnership-based foreign policy. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=143.70000000000002s)]
*  If Donald Trump were to come back, suddenly these partnerships would all be placed at [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=145.96s)]
*  risk. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=150.08s)]
*  Foreign policy implications of this election are arguably going to be greater than any [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=151.08s)]
*  election in modern history. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=154.56s)]
*  Victor, what are all those alliances? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=156.36s)]
*  Have I missed the huge amount of money that Europe is putting into the war in Ukraine? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  Have I missed that? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=164.92000000000002s)]
*  They don't understand that the world is being remade before our very eyes, Laura. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=167.48s)]
*  We're not an ally of Turkey anymore. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  Turkey really doesn't belong in NATO. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=175.23999999999998s)]
*  We see that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=176.76s)]
*  Qatar is working hand in glove with Hamas, and yet we have a CENTCOM base in Qatar. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=177.76s)]
*  And they keep talking about offensive operations and disproportionate use of force in Ukraine. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=185.32s)]
*  And that's exactly what they tell the Israelis not to do. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  So they're incoherent. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=194.83999999999997s)]
*  They never tell us we're going to have X amount of billions of dollars for these programs, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=196.2s)]
*  for foreign aid, and some of it's probably arguably necessary, especially with Israel. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=202.0s)]
*  But they never tell us where the money's coming from. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=206.51999999999998s)]
*  We're going to cut here to spend here, or we're going to tax. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=208.48s)]
*  They never do. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=211.73999999999998s)]
*  It's always, we're going to print more money for this agenda. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=212.73999999999998s)]
*  And then we look at it and we say, well, how did Libya turn out? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=215.04s)]
*  How did Syria turn out? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=218.56s)]
*  Why is Turkey threatening to attack our ally Israel? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=220.51999999999998s)]
*  What is Qatar doing with CENTCOM? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=224.14s)]
*  And then it's working with Hamas. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=226.64s)]
*  How about Iraq and Afghanistan? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=228.64s)]
*  Yeah, and with the Kabul. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=229.64s)]
*  How are those working out? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=230.64s)]
*  They never say they're sorry. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=231.64s)]
*  They never say they're sorry. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=233.39999999999998s)]
*  They never say they're going to learn from their mistakes. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=234.55999999999997s)]
*  It's trust us, and we don't trust them anymore. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=236.73999999999998s)]
*  Victor, great to see you tonight. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=239.27999999999997s)]
*  And the voters don't. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=240.77999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, the voters don't have a base of both parties. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=241.77999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TaO5Pz09vE&t=244.61999999999998s)]
