# IDF, Hamas point fingers over alleged cease-fire violation
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs)
*  And the IDF, meanwhile, saying that Palestinians violated the ceasefire by detonating three [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=0.0s)]
*  explosive devices near Israeli troops earlier today. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=4.7s)]
*  This is happening now after the pause in fighting extended through Wednesday. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=9.24s)]
*  Congressman Mike Gallagher here to react on that in a moment. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=13.92s)]
*  But first, we want to go live to our correspondent, Trey Yanks, who's at a medical center in Tel [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=16.36s)]
*  Aviv where many of the hostages have been taken first. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=21.16s)]
*  And Trey, hello. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=25.72s)]
*  The latest at this hour. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=26.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=28.32s)]
*  Hey, Bill. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=29.32s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=30.32s)]
*  I do want to start with that breaking news. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=31.32s)]
*  The Israelis say for the first time since this agreement went into effect, the ceasefire [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=33.36s)]
*  was violated by Hamas. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=38.08s)]
*  The Israelis say there were three large explosions in northern Gaza, likely caused by IEDs injuring [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=40.28s)]
*  a number of Israeli troops. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=45.599999999999994s)]
*  They are listed in light condition, but it gives you a sense of how delicate this agreement [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=47.0s)]
*  is. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  The Israelis also say there was an exchange of fire, but Hamas pointing the finger at [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  Israel today. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=56.24s)]
*  So it's unclear how this will affect the ongoing conversations and the extension of the ceasefire [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=57.28s)]
*  that we're in right now. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=62.440000000000005s)]
*  Now, overnight, we know 11 additional hostages were released. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=64.0s)]
*  They were brought here to the Iqilov Medical Center in Tel Aviv, nine of them children. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=67.36s)]
*  All of them have fathers still being held inside the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=72.4s)]
*  They are from the small community of Neroz that sits along the Gaza border. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=75.8s)]
*  Israeli officials are hopeful that an additional 10 hostages will be released tonight as part [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=79.88s)]
*  of this broader ceasefire extension. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=84.28s)]
*  But Israeli media reporting at this hour, they do not anticipate after the ceasefire [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  ends tomorrow that there will be any additional time on the clock. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=91.44s)]
*  The Israelis expected to resume their air and ground campaign against Hamas. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=94.68s)]
*  Look at this video here of the Brodach family. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=99.56s)]
*  They were reunited with one of their pets over the weekend, and you see the joy on the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=101.68s)]
*  faces of these children. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=105.32s)]
*  It really cuts through the noise of this story to the people affected. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=107.44s)]
*  They were held inside Gaza for more than 50 days and finally reunited with their loved [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=111.02s)]
*  ones. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=115.66s)]
*  Not every family, though, has this opportunity. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=116.66s)]
*  Many still held inside the Gaza Strip, those like the Bebas family, whose aunt spoke out [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=118.94s)]
*  today saying this. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=123.58s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=126.46s)]
*  It's crazy just thinking about it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=127.86s)]
*  We're waiting hopelessly, trying to remain positive. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=130.22s)]
*  Every day counts for that baby. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=136.35999999999999s)]
*  It's been two months, almost two months. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=139.4s)]
*  He was nine months when he was kidnapped. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=141.84s)]
*  It's going to be 11 months. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=143.32s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=145.6s)]
*  A 10-month-old baby kidnapped by Hamas being held inside the Gaza Strip still today at [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=146.6s)]
*  53 days. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=154.4s)]
*  This is the longest war ever between Israel and Gaza. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=155.64000000000001s)]
*  Bill. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=158.92000000000002s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  Trey Yanks, thank you. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=160.92000000000002s)]
*  In Tel Aviv. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzFr0px6MEs&t=161.92000000000002s)]
