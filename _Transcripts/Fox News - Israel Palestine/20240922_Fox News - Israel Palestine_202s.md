# It is ‘critical’ that Netanyahu keeps his eye on the ‘main fight,’ US gen says
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [September 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg)
*  Well, our next guest knows all about fighting radical Islamists. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=0.0s)]
*  Retired U.S. Army Brigadier General Anthony Tata joins us now. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=3.84s)]
*  General, thank you for being here. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=7.04s)]
*  First of all, based on your assessment, the pager and radio attacks that were so effective, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=9.16s)]
*  now the bombing of leadership structure, presumably because they knew their location, considering [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=15.08s)]
*  how compromised Hezbollah was, how devastated is Hezbollah, first? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=20.04s)]
*  And second of all, how likely is a wider conflict here? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=23.96s)]
*  Hey, Pete, good morning. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=26.6s)]
*  Well, I think the conflict is pretty wide right now. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=28.6s)]
*  I think it's going to continue to grow. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=31.48s)]
*  I think it stems from the lack of moral clarity from Kamala Harris and the Biden White House. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=33.44s)]
*  And it all stems back to goes back to Iran. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=40.6s)]
*  With the precise targeting of leadership in Hezbollah, I think what you see here is the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=44.8s)]
*  very difference between the Israeli Defense Force approach to combat and war, very surgical [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=51.08s)]
*  precise targeting, eliminating civilian casualties. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=58.24s)]
*  And then the retaliation of Hezbollah, indiscriminate bombing. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=61.52s)]
*  They don't care about collateral damage. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=65.44s)]
*  They don't care about civilian casualties. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=67.24000000000001s)]
*  They're bombing Nazareth, the hometown of Jesus. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=69.76s)]
*  And also, by the way, 70 percent Arab population called Nazareth the Arab capital of Israel. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  They don't care who they're killing. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  So I think what this shows is a takeout of a lot of the leadership and then a retaliation [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=81.60000000000001s)]
*  that's run by the second, third, fourth man down in the lineup. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=90.04s)]
*  And they're not precise. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=96.68s)]
*  They're not accurate. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=98.64s)]
*  And it's very indiscriminate. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=100.44s)]
*  And that's their approach. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=101.44s)]
*  And I think that's a very stark difference between Israel and Hezbollah or Hamas or [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  any of the Islamic regime there. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=108.2s)]
*  General, more or less since October 7th, much of northern Israel has evacuated. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=110.76s)]
*  You've got tens of thousands of Israelis who can't be in their homes because of the ongoing [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=115.12s)]
*  missiles that are being fired in the north. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=120.2s)]
*  Not that what's happened in Gaza is wrapped up. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=124.2s)]
*  It's not. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=125.92s)]
*  There's still pockets of Hamas and things that need to be maintained there. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=126.92s)]
*  But would now be the time for Israel to reestablish deterrence or defeat Hezbollah? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=130.64s)]
*  Is that a prospect here? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=136.64s)]
*  Well, I think, you know, Pete, what you highlight is the fact that Hezbollah is trying to pin [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=139.04s)]
*  down, fix, as you know, in military terms that we call it, forces in the north so they [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=144.2s)]
*  can't finish up Hamas in the south. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=150.04s)]
*  And I think it's critical that Netanyahu keeps his eye on the main fight, which is Hamas, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=153.23999999999998s)]
*  and he eliminates Hamas, as you know, in military parlance. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=160.11999999999998s)]
*  You have a main effort and a secondary effort, a supporting effort. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=164.32s)]
*  The main effort is still Hamas. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=169.48s)]
*  And I think what they have to do is hold what they've got and hold off Hezbollah until they [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=171.16s)]
*  finish up Hamas and then they can move to the north and defeat, destroy Hezbollah with [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=176.2s)]
*  the main. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=184.35999999999999s)]
*  You can't do two things at once equally well, typically in the military. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, all while the current administration, Harris Biden, plays footsie with Iran and [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=191.76s)]
*  allows them to fund all of this stuff. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=198.12s)]
*  General Tata, thank you very much for your time. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxlpSucqnvg&t=199.72s)]
