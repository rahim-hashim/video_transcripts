# WATCH: Anti-Israel protesters shut down Senate cafeteria
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxCLfICB1-o)
*  Well, we are hoping to bring you this video within seconds. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxCLfICB1-o&t=0.0s)]
*  Breaking news from inside the Capitol building, anti-Israel protesters just shut down the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxCLfICB1-o&t=4.8s)]
*  largest cafeteria on the Senate side. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxCLfICB1-o&t=9.32s)]
*  And they were chanting, according to our producers there, they were saying that the Capitol police [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxCLfICB1-o&t=11.8s)]
*  are chanting, everybody out or be placed under arrest. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxCLfICB1-o&t=17.16s)]
*  And the protesters were shouting back, this is the House of the people, the Senate can't [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxCLfICB1-o&t=20.92s)]
*  eat until Gaza eats. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxCLfICB1-o&t=27.919999999999998s)]
*  Fox News has now learned that many of those activists are the same ones who interrupted [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxCLfICB1-o&t=30.12s)]
*  Secretary Lloyd Austin's testimony earlier today during a Senate Armed Services hearing [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxCLfICB1-o&t=34.72s)]
*  that was looking into the military budget. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxCLfICB1-o&t=40.24s)]
*  Now, we have seen so many of these protesters now show up even outside the Wilmington, Delaware [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxCLfICB1-o&t=43.2s)]
*  home of the president of the United States. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxCLfICB1-o&t=48.68s)]
*  They follow Biden around everywhere he goes now, every state. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxCLfICB1-o&t=51.68s)]
*  They may not have been protesters, but the vote against him that was uncommitted in [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxCLfICB1-o&t=55.839999999999996s)]
*  places where we've seen so much anti-Israel movement, like Michigan. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxCLfICB1-o&t=60.08s)]
*  In those places, those voters were above 100,000 voting, uncommitted, not for Biden. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxCLfICB1-o&t=66.12s)]
*  So this is a political side. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxCLfICB1-o&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  We have the video, roll. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxCLfICB1-o&t=72.66s)]
*  So here it is. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxCLfICB1-o&t=74.08s)]
*  So protesters gathered, shutting down the largest cafeteria on the Senate side of Capitol [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxCLfICB1-o&t=75.62s)]
*  Hill, making their voices heard, going back and forth with cops. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxCLfICB1-o&t=81.92s)]
*  America reports will be all over it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxCLfICB1-o&t=88.04s)]
*  Stay tuned. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxCLfICB1-o&t=90.0s)]
