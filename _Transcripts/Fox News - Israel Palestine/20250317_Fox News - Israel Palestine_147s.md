# BREAKING: Israel-Hamas ceasefire over as IDF carries out strikes in Gaza Strip
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [March 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUx71sXnEw)
*  in a minute, but first joining us now with the very latest out of the Middle East, our [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUx71sXnEw&t=0.0s)]
*  own Trey Yanks. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUx71sXnEw&t=3.56s)]
*  Trey, a lot of activity tonight. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUx71sXnEw&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, Sean, good evening. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUx71sXnEw&t=7.08s)]
*  Breaking news tonight. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUx71sXnEw&t=9.64s)]
*  Out of the Middle East, Israeli fighter jets are currently striking the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUx71sXnEw&t=10.8s)]
*  The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is over. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUx71sXnEw&t=15.52s)]
*  The prime minister's office releasing a statement early this morning saying from now on Israel [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUx71sXnEw&t=18.88s)]
*  will operate against Hamas with increasing military force. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUx71sXnEw&t=23.92s)]
*  The operational plan was presented late last week by the IDF and approved by the political [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUx71sXnEw&t=27.72s)]
*  echelon. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUx71sXnEw&t=32.6s)]
*  Reports from inside Gaza indicate there are extensive Israeli strikes taking place across [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUx71sXnEw&t=33.6s)]
*  the Strip in major population centers like Gaza City and the southern city of Ra'afa. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUx71sXnEw&t=39.2s)]
*  As this story progresses, we will continue to find out more information and determine [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUx71sXnEw&t=45.4s)]
*  whether or not Israeli ground forces are involved. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUx71sXnEw&t=49.64s)]
*  But remember, this comes after a nearly two month ceasefire that went into effect in mid [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUx71sXnEw&t=52.96s)]
*  January and saw dozens of living hostages freed from Hamas captivity. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUx71sXnEw&t=57.92s)]
*  President Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, has been working overtime in the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUx71sXnEw&t=64.2s)]
*  region, ferrying messages back and forth, not only between Tel Aviv and Washington, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUx71sXnEw&t=68.0s)]
*  but also in cities like Doha and Cairo. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUx71sXnEw&t=72.88s)]
*  The Trump team was working late into this week trying to determine if they could get [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUx71sXnEw&t=75.82s)]
*  a last minute deal together between Israel and Hamas. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUx71sXnEw&t=80.48s)]
*  There was a plan presented that would see 11 living hostages freed from Gaza exchanged [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUx71sXnEw&t=83.80000000000001s)]
*  for Palestinian prisoners, but Hamas was simply not willing to accept that agreement. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUx71sXnEw&t=89.04s)]
*  And clearly tonight, the Israelis have gone back to war against this organization inside [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUx71sXnEw&t=93.68s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUx71sXnEw&t=98.60000000000001s)]
*  Again, the latest information that we have, Israeli fighter jets are flying over the Strip, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUx71sXnEw&t=99.60000000000001s)]
*  striking Hamas targets inside Gaza at this hour. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUx71sXnEw&t=104.44s)]
*  And Israel's Home Front Command, responsible for communicating messages of emergency to [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUx71sXnEw&t=107.76s)]
*  the civilian population here in Israel, says that all schools near to the Gaza border have [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUx71sXnEw&t=112.64s)]
*  been closed tomorrow as they are warning the civilian population about the possibility [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUx71sXnEw&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  of Hamas and Islamic Jihad rocket fire coming from Gaza. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUx71sXnEw&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  Sean? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUx71sXnEw&t=126.68s)]
*  And Trey, this on the heels of President Trump's strike against the Houthi rebels and his warning [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUx71sXnEw&t=127.68s)]
*  and admonition to Iran, on top of the warning that he gave Hamas. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUx71sXnEw&t=132.68s)]
*  They had a very limited time to turn the hostages over. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUx71sXnEw&t=136.88s)]
*  They didn't do it, and here we are. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUx71sXnEw&t=141.01999999999998s)]
*  I expect this will get worse before it gets better. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUx71sXnEw&t=143.48s)]
*  Trey, thank you. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUx71sXnEw&t=145.84s)]
