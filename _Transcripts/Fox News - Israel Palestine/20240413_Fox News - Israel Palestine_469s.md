# Iran launches drone attack on Israel
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ)
*  Yeah, hey, John, good evening. We've got a lot of updates for you here in this developing story. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=0.0s)]
*  We'll start with a new directive from Israel's Home Front Command. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  This is the organization linked to the military responsible for communicating to civilians here. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=8.4s)]
*  They are telling civilians in the Golan Heights, also in Israel's southernmost city of Eilat, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  and in some smaller cities and towns close to the Negev Desert to stay near bomb shelters, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=20.72s)]
*  with an indication that Israeli officials believe this initial wave of drones is going to target the northern and southern parts of this country. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=27.44s)]
*  We also at this hour are reporting on a new statement from Iran's permanent mission to the UN. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=36.92s)]
*  There was a post put out on X, and as we speak here, you can actually hear an Israeli jet going overhead, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  but there was a post put out on X by the Iranian government through their permanent mission to the UN. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=51.48s)]
*  That post read that they have conducted the matter, saying it could be deemed concluded, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=58.12s)]
*  an indication that Iran wants to try and contain their response to the Israeli strike earlier this month [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=64.28s)]
*  on the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria, that killed seven members of Iran's IRGC. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  The question now is whether or not the Israeli government and military will accept this event as over. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=77.64s)]
*  Remember, these drones have not yet reached Israeli airspace. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=83.8s)]
*  We don't know the true extent of the attack yet. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=87.16s)]
*  There is no indication at this hour, despite reports in Iranian media, that the Iranians have fired ballistic missiles. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=90.08s)]
*  There are some other reports that indicate cruise missiles could be part of this attack. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=96.52000000000001s)]
*  Once Israel determines just how broad of an attack this is, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=101.16s)]
*  the war cabinet that is still meeting at this hour in Tel Aviv at the Kiryat, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=104.76s)]
*  Israel's version of the Pentagon, will ultimately launch their response. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=108.60000000000001s)]
*  We do understand there will be an Israeli response to this attack against their territory. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=113.4s)]
*  The question is what that response might look like and what type of coordination is currently being conducted [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=119.08000000000001s)]
*  with the American forces that are operating right now out of the Middle East. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=124.64s)]
*  John? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=128.72s)]
*  So Trey, these reports that Iran fired ballistic missiles, those are coming from Iranian media. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=129.2s)]
*  And so far there's no absolute confirmation of that because that would be a game changer here. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  Absolutely, it would be a game changer. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=143.96s)]
*  And it's important to note Israel does have the air defense capabilities to shoot down such missiles. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=145.76s)]
*  There are a variety of missiles the Iranians have in their arsenal. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=152.2s)]
*  The Shahab ballistic missile would likely be what they would use in a situation like this. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=156.28s)]
*  The range covers all of Israel. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  But Israel has an advanced missile defense system called the Arrow 2. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=164.08s)]
*  And also they have a later version of this system called the Arrow 3. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=169.0s)]
*  Now these systems have been tested. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=173.36s)]
*  They are extremely efficient and they have the ability to shoot down these advanced ballistic missiles. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=175.60000000000002s)]
*  This system would be used by the Israelis if the Iranians ratchet up their attack. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=181.32s)]
*  And if that does take place, as you've noted, it would be another step up on an escalation ladder [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=187.4s)]
*  that is already being climbed by both the Israelis and the Iranians. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=193.2s)]
*  Earlier this month, as we noted, the Israelis targeted these Iranian generals in Syria. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=197.0s)]
*  Go ahead, John. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=201.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, I just wanted to interrupt you for just a second, Trey. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=202.48s)]
*  And I apologize because you're doing terrific work under difficult circumstances. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=204.72s)]
*  But the video you're seeing on your screen right now is footage taken from Iraq of the Iranian drones [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=208.84s)]
*  actually flying over Iraqi territory, presumably on their way to Israel. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=216.04s)]
*  You can see that the flame column coming out of these things is pretty significant. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=222.2s)]
*  They throw off a lot of heat and it's fairly easy for the interceptors to pick up on that heat signature [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=228.0s)]
*  and bring down these drones. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=236.64s)]
*  So it is hoped that no matter how many dozens of them have been launched, perhaps 100, perhaps more than 100, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=238.72s)]
*  that most of them are going to get shot down by some of those Israeli systems that you talked about. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=246.48s)]
*  Again, that footage from Iraq after Iran for the first time ever launched a series of strikes [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=253.07999999999998s)]
*  launching dozens, maybe hundreds of cruise missiles to fly over Iraqi territory and on to Israel. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=260.84s)]
*  All right, Trey, let's get back to you in Tel Aviv. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=268.35999999999996s)]
*  Sorry to interrupt. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=271.2s)]
*  And I'm looking at this video here and we should note two things. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=274.2s)]
*  There are reports that indicate cruise missiles could be involved in this attack. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=278.44s)]
*  And the second thing of note here, when we look at video coming out of Iraq, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=283.47999999999996s)]
*  is the fact that Iran has control over these Shia militias that operate across Iraq. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=288.76000000000005s)]
*  They have been used in the past to target American bases in the Middle East. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=296.28000000000003s)]
*  And the real concern is that these proxy forces will not only be involved in this initial response toward Israel, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=301.44000000000005s)]
*  but could be involved in any sort of escalating conflict that unfolds as a result of this Iranian attack tonight toward the Jewish state. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=308.88000000000005s)]
*  There is a concern from the Israelis that they could be overwhelmed with the amount of drones and possibly cruise missiles [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=318.24s)]
*  that are used in this initial Iranian attack. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=326.12s)]
*  And it's part of the reason that you've seen such close coordination with their allies, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=328.88s)]
*  including the Americans, to shoot down some of these projectiles being launched from Iranian territory and possibly Iraqi territory. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=332.96000000000004s)]
*  There are initial reports coming in and I'm just getting this from my producer right now. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=342.2s)]
*  According to two U.S. officials, the U.S. military shot down at least one Iranian drone that was headed toward Israel. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=347.12s)]
*  Now, they would have shot down this drone with fighter jets that are currently operating in the Middle East. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=354.59999999999997s)]
*  We also understand, according to our defense sources here in Israel, the Israelis have had jets in the sky all night, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=359.88s)]
*  even before this attack started, in anticipation of the attack. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=367.12s)]
*  And remember, earlier this evening, on the phone, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=371.15999999999997s)]
*  Israel's Defense Minister, Yoav Galant, spoke with his American counterpart, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=373.88s)]
*  There has been a close coordination between the Americans and the Israelis, anticipating this attack would take place. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=380.12s)]
*  The intelligence was correct. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=387.32s)]
*  And when we talk about the war that's unfolded over the past six months in Israel, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=389.28s)]
*  there has been a lot of criticism about Israeli intelligence and the American intelligence provided to the Israelis [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=393.36s)]
*  that they miss things when it comes to the attacks from Hamas and Islamic Jihad. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=399.24s)]
*  They were spot on with this. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=403.08000000000004s)]
*  The anticipation was high. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=404.68s)]
*  It's part of the reason the Israeli society did not have runs on banks or grocery stores at a large extent. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=406.36s)]
*  Right now, things are calm in Israel's major population centers, including Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=412.64000000000004s)]
*  And while there are these instructions from Israel's Home Front Command for civilians living in the northern and southernmost parts of this country, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=417.88s)]
*  they are very simple instructions. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=425.48s)]
*  They are asking civilians to stay close to bomb shelters at this hour, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=426.84000000000003s)]
*  understanding that if these drones slip past the fighter jets and the air defense systems, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=431.08s)]
*  they could target civilian population centers. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=436.52s)]
*  But no one is panicking at this moment. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=439.52s)]
*  And there are Israeli officials, as we speak, that are trying to determine what the Israeli response will be to this unprecedented event, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=441.91999999999996s)]
*  a direct attack from Iranian territory targeting Israel. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=449.79999999999995s)]
*  John. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=453.76s)]
*  Trey Yengst from Tel Aviv, live. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=454.28s)]
*  Trey, thank you. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl30y5OOfqQ&t=456.44s)]
