# Iranian drones enter Israeli airspace: Report
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c)
*  Israel, General Anthony Tata joins us right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=0.0s)]
*  General, thanks so much for being on with us. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=3.24s)]
*  You know, we just heard former President Trump [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  talk about how these attacks wouldn't have happened [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=7.4s)]
*  under him in regards to the fact [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=9.48s)]
*  that the Biden administration has released the sanctions [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=11.32s)]
*  on Iran, they've given direct fundings, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=14.72s)]
*  and they've also allowed the missile ban to expire. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=17.04s)]
*  What is your take on it? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=21.04s)]
*  Well, I think all of that is absolutely right. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=23.36s)]
*  The maximum pressure campaign that we had on Iran [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=25.96s)]
*  when I was performing the duties as Undersecretary of Defense [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=30.040000000000003s)]
*  and throughout the Trump administration [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=33.72s)]
*  was very, very effective. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  They didn't have the means to do what they're doing. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=37.32s)]
*  They didn't have the means to even wage the type of war [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=39.68s)]
*  that they're waging through their proxies [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=42.64s)]
*  from Lebanon and Syria and Iraq and down in Yemen. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=45.160000000000004s)]
*  And so the Arabian Peninsula right now is on fire [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=48.92s)]
*  because of the Biden administration's funding of Iran [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=52.32s)]
*  to do this, $6 billion for the six hostages, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=57.08s)]
*  and then the not enforcing the sanctions [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=59.84s)]
*  and allowing them to trade oil with China, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=63.28s)]
*  tens of billions of dollars, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=66.12s)]
*  all that money goes into the means of war, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=67.64s)]
*  most of it does, and funding of Hamas and Hesbala [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  and the Houthi rebels, and even funding the Shahed 131, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=75.28s)]
*  136 drones that they're given to Russia to attack Ukraine. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=81.28s)]
*  And so that's American dollars [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=88.68s)]
*  that have been paid for a lot of this. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=90.76s)]
*  And it's right squarely on the shoulders [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=92.88s)]
*  of the Biden administration in this split policy [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=96.9s)]
*  that they're trying to have it both ways to curry favor [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=100.16s)]
*  in Dearborn, Michigan with Islamic voters [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=103.44s)]
*  and the progressive left, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=107.08s)]
*  while also pretending to be supportive of Israel. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=108.84s)]
*  It's a really, this is what happens [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=111.60000000000001s)]
*  when you don't have a clear vision, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=114.06s)]
*  you divide the American people to try to maintain your power [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=116.10000000000001s)]
*  and you are not standing shoulder to shoulder [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=120.04s)]
*  with our allies, despite the slings and arrows [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=124.04s)]
*  that you take from within your own political party. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=127.08000000000001s)]
*  This is about national security, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=129.16s)]
*  it's about global security, it's about economic security. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=130.96s)]
*  Think about the economic ramifications [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=134.28s)]
*  that can come out of this if this persists. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=137.01999999999998s)]
*  General, it's Griff Jenkins, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=140.38s)]
*  we've been watching live pictures in Tel Aviv and elsewhere, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=141.85999999999999s)]
*  we're seeing the defense systems, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=145.42s)]
*  whether it's Iron Dome responding to these drones, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=148.14s)]
*  we know that the US has assisted in shooting down [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=151.1s)]
*  at least some of these drones, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=154.42s)]
*  we've been hearing the sirens in Tray Inc's live shots, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=156.0s)]
*  we know of course they also have the David Sling system [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=160.01999999999998s)]
*  and then for much larger missiles, the Arrow system. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=163.22s)]
*  How do you assess things [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=166.52s)]
*  as based on what you've seen now? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=170.08s)]
*  Because this comes with the backdrop of a historic moment, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=172.04000000000002s)]
*  an unprecedented attack, this is the first time [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=176.0s)]
*  Tehran has struck directly at Israel [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=178.8s)]
*  and it appears they're going also, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=181.8s)]
*  not only in the northern areas like Golan Heights [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=184.38s)]
*  in the Negev Desert, but at major cities [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=187.20000000000002s)]
*  like Jerusalem, like Tel Aviv. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=190.12s)]
*  Hey, Griff, great to chat with you again. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=192.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, sure, the David Sling has about a 90% success rate, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=195.12s)]
*  the Patriot has far less than that, about one and two, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=200.28s)]
*  Iron Dome's about 80 to 90%, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=203.8s)]
*  and then the Arrow 3 has a very high 98, 99% success rate. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=206.32s)]
*  So the first three, the Iron Dome, David Sling, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=211.16s)]
*  and the Patriot are gonna be shooting down those drones. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=214.4s)]
*  If you have ballistic missiles coming in, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=217.72s)]
*  that's the Arrow 3 that engages on that, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=219.52s)]
*  and so you got a very capable military, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=222.04000000000002s)]
*  and the question is, with the IDF, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=226.08s)]
*  the question is whether or not they have sufficient stockpiles [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=228.76000000000002s)]
*  to sustain defensive measures against swarming drones [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=232.84s)]
*  and swarming ballistic missiles over time. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=236.88000000000002s)]
*  How deep do those stockpiles go? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=240.4s)]
*  And remember, this administration, a year ago, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=243.16000000000003s)]
*  made Israel give up a bunch of 155 artillery ammunition [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=247.52s)]
*  to Ukraine, and so the, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=251.88000000000002s)]
*  the government is very capable of defending itself. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=255.84s)]
*  I've read that their cabinet has approved [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=259.28000000000003s)]
*  a very strong response, and so I think you might see [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=262.56s)]
*  some offensive measures here that, you know, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=265.92s)]
*  they're not gonna be worrying about [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=270.0s)]
*  what the Biden administration is trying to tell them to do. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=271.68s)]
*  General, oh, go ahead, Jason. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=274.36s)]
*  General, this is Jason Chaffetz. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=276.0s)]
*  This was foreshadowed, it was telegraphed. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=278.44s)]
*  You can see this coming. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=281.24s)]
*  And I think there's a lot of talk about this. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=282.8s)]
*  How do you read that from a military standpoint? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=284.71999999999997s)]
*  Are they doing that on purpose to lessen the actual blow [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=287.12s)]
*  so there isn't an escalation, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=290.32s)]
*  or is this perhaps a distraction [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=292.15999999999997s)]
*  so that perhaps there's another blow [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=294.32s)]
*  coming in another direction? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=295.96s)]
*  How do you read that from a military standpoint? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=297.92s)]
*  Yeah, Jason, what I think is that, you know, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=300.64s)]
*  the intelligence was probably pretty good on this, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=304.03999999999996s)]
*  particularly from Israel, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=308.48s)]
*  and I think they were in agreement with them, certainly. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=309.96000000000004s)]
*  And once we made it public, once Israel made it public, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=312.44s)]
*  I think Iran was put on the horns of a dilemma. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=316.6s)]
*  Do they go ahead and do it, or do they not, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=319.96000000000004s)]
*  or do they wait? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=323.0s)]
*  And I think that they made, you know, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=324.20000000000005s)]
*  with springmanship, and they made a decision, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=326.52000000000004s)]
*  and it is good to hear that if it's true what they say, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=328.84000000000003s)]
*  and you can never believe what they say, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=332.92s)]
*  but if it's true that this is kind of their shot [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=334.20000000000005s)]
*  until something else happens, then that's refreshing, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=337.8s)]
*  but what they've done is they poked the bearer with the IDF [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=341.56s)]
*  and the cabinet there, and I think Israel sees, you know, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=345.12s)]
*  they haven't hesitated going to Iran before [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  when they destroyed a nuclear production facility [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=354.24s)]
*  several years ago, so what I see is Israel, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=359.59999999999997s)]
*  you know, taking the fight to Iran, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=364.03999999999996s)]
*  and given as good as they're getting right now. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=368.08s)]
*  Wow, General, I see that so many questions. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=373.91999999999996s)]
*  I'm curious about how this new front with Iran, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=375.47999999999996s)]
*  how that might affect how Israel is fighting the war in Gaza, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=378.59999999999997s)]
*  if at all, but I guess just in general, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=382.44s)]
*  I mean, I'm thinking about myself sitting, you know, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=385.0s)]
*  behind this desk, on the couch at Fox and Friends [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=387.79999999999995s)]
*  over the last, you know, year or two, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=390.64s)]
*  the idea of World War III, something we never thought [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=393.32s)]
*  we could be thinking about or talking about, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=397.28s)]
*  how worried are you that that might be happening? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=400.2s)]
*  I mean, we're in a really crazy situation right now. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=403.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, Rachel, you and I have talked before [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=407.64s)]
*  about the going from energy independent to energy dependent, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=409.64s)]
*  dependent on Iranian oil, dependent on Venezuelan oil, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=413.71999999999997s)]
*  and how that sort of makes us dependent [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=417.44s)]
*  on this Arabian peninsula for energy, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=419.32s)]
*  which is so important to fueling our economy. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=422.32s)]
*  This Iranian attack emboldens the Shia militia groups [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=425.71999999999997s)]
*  in Hezbollah and Hamas and the West Bank, the Houthis, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=429.71999999999997s)]
*  those that are attacking our soldiers in Syria and Iraq. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=434.88s)]
*  And so it's seen as, you know, big daddy is coming in [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=438.28s)]
*  and saying, look at us, we're doing this, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=442.71999999999997s)]
*  so follow suit, and we're already seeing some riots [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=444.52s)]
*  in the West Bank and so forth. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=448.52s)]
*  So, you know, it is a tinderbox in the utter incompetence [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=449.96s)]
*  of the Biden administration, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=454.47999999999996s)]
*  the worst secretary of state we've ever had [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=456.28s)]
*  in the history of our country, Antony Blinken. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=458.76s)]
*  I don't know who he talks to [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=461.44s)]
*  because he hasn't done any diplomacy, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=462.68s)]
*  and this is when we need that. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=466.08s)]
*  We need to be talking to our allies and partners [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=467.71999999999997s)]
*  in the region, the Saudis, the Emiratis, and all the others, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=470.68s)]
*  so that we can find a way forward [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=475.16s)]
*  and keep Israel as our greatest ally in the region. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=478.36s)]
*  General Anthony Tata, great insight, as always. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=482.64000000000004s)]
*  Thank you for joining us on this evening. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=485.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kru33iv-c&t=487.20000000000005s)]
