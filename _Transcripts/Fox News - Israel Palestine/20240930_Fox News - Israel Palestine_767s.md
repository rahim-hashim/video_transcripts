# Trey Yingst: This could be first step to wider war
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [September 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM)
*  In fact, let's bring in Trey now. Trey, welcome. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you, Brian. Thanks for having me. First off, where are you? Are you stateside? Are you still? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=4.8s)]
*  Right now I'm in the Middle East and I'll leave it at that. We'll have more tomorrow. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=10.92s)]
*  But you know, we're in the field and sort of gathering information as it relates to this developing story. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  What looks like according to reports is going to be a ground invasion of Lebanon. They have tunnels too. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=21.580000000000002s)]
*  They are heavily tunneled like Gaza. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=27.4s)]
*  Yes, they do. And actually, back in 2019, my cameraman and I, David Gommel, we went into these tunnels and we saw how big they are. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=32.04s)]
*  And I've been in the tunnels underneath Gaza. The tunnels they have in Lebanon are actually larger. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=39.72s)]
*  They are able to use more advanced equipment to dig them. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=43.84s)]
*  And that's part of what the Israelis are trying to make sure that they don't get caught in ambushes that they saw in Gaza, but on a larger scale. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=47.12s)]
*  How much damage is done to that organization, Trey? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  We never I personally never thought something like this could happen. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=56.919999999999995s)]
*  You can not only killing Nasrallah, but 30 higher ups, 30 leaders, as well as thousands injured in the pager walkie talkie blasts. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=60.0s)]
*  I mean, it's remarkable when you think back a year ago, this was the fear for the Israelis that there would be a large ground operation into [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=68.75999999999999s)]
*  southern Lebanon and that they would face a lot of heavy fire and rocket fire at the same time that would overwhelm Israeli cities. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=77.32s)]
*  The Israelis have minimized both of those threats by conducting these operations over the past several weeks, because when we talked before about the concept of war with Hezbollah in Lebanon, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=86.19999999999999s)]
*  they were made out to be this organization that was almost unbeatable, that would overwhelm Israeli air defense, that would be blackouts, we were told, across Israel. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=96.0s)]
*  Hundreds of civilians would die and the Israelis hit them hard over the past year since they got involved in the war on October 8th. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=104.39999999999999s)]
*  But just over the past weekend, I mean, killing Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Iran's largest proxy in the Middle East, taking out, according to reports, the vast majority of the rocket and missile launching capabilities above ground. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=111.11999999999999s)]
*  And so it's very significant what the Israelis have done. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=122.28s)]
*  Around a thousand people, according to local health officials, have died in the process. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=125.64s)]
*  And we should note that in the course of our reporting, but this is a significant development and it is what the Americans fear, possibly the first step toward a broader regional conflict. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  True or false? They did not even inform the U.S. that they were going to take out Nasrallah with 80 tons of bombs until the planes are in the air. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=140.72000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, we can confirm that and it's pretty remarkable and it gives you a sense of the fact that there is quite a bit of trust between the Israelis and the Americans, but also a little bit of distrust. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=149.60000000000002s)]
*  There's real concern that the calls for a ceasefire from President Biden and other top American officials are so real that they could actually get in the way of Israeli operations. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=158.76s)]
*  And so that's part of the reason that the Israelis are very careful about what and when they share information. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  Here's Tom Cotton, Cut 4. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=172.84s)]
*  Over the last four years, they've given away tens of billions of dollars in sanctions relief. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=175.4s)]
*  They've looked the other way as Iran violates sanctions. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=180.48s)]
*  They've continually put more pressure on Israel than they put on Iran's terrorist proxy. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=183.67999999999998s)]
*  That's why Kamala Harris is the Ayatollah's handpicked candidate and why the Ayatollah's are hacking into Donald Trump's campaign and trying to kill him. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=188.72s)]
*  So there's some stuff that you can't comment on because it's politics, but is that the perception that many Israelis have? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=197.2s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. And look, the Israelis have been living this conflict for the past year. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=205.0s)]
*  It started on October 7th with the massacre that Hamas conducted against southern Israel. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=209.23999999999998s)]
*  And now it has expanded to multi-front. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=215.28s)]
*  I mean, there are rockets not just coming anymore from Gaza. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=218.88s)]
*  I mean, much of that rocket fire has stopped. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=223.16s)]
*  Now there's still rocket fire coming from Lebanon. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=224.83999999999997s)]
*  Over the past week, there have been two ballistic missile attacks on Israel. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=227.32s)]
*  And those are coming from the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=231.04s)]
*  There are proxy groups in places like Iraq and Syria that are backed by Iran. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=234.23999999999998s)]
*  These Shia militias that are still able to target Israel. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=239.0s)]
*  And so it's a real seven-front war for the Israelis. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=242.84s)]
*  And their focus is on continuing this conflict while the Americans are looking for an off-ramp in all of this. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=245.64000000000001s)]
*  And so I think Americans and Israelis see the situation very differently. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=251.36s)]
*  You know, you have a chance. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=255.64000000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's the IDF that's bombing out the Houthi rebels who have shut down the Red Sea and are shooting at us. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=256.52s)]
*  You know, it's the IDF that took the shot at Iran, who clearly are our number one Middle Eastern enemy in the Middle. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=261.72s)]
*  And a lot of enemy to many. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=268.28000000000003s)]
*  Give me an idea. Like, people just think Nasrallah dies and Middle East is upset. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=270.84000000000003s)]
*  The Syrians are not upset that Nasrallah is dead. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=275.0s)]
*  How many nations out there, Gulf Coast nations, didn't really get along with the Hezbollah leader? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=277.88s)]
*  Many. And when you look at the people who were celebrating as a result of this strike that killed Nasrallah and also a deputy commander of Iran's IRGC, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=285.44s)]
*  it's significant because Nasrallah was not just responsible for the deaths of Israelis and Americans, but also people across the region. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=295.24s)]
*  I mean, Syrian rebels were celebrating. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=301.2s)]
*  You saw in some cities in Syria, they were giving out candy following this. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=303.15999999999997s)]
*  And so in a weird way, but a true way, the Israelis have done the dirty work for some other countries who saw Nasrallah also as an enemy. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=306.44s)]
*  And that's sort of an interesting complex about this entire story. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=316.28s)]
*  So let's talk about your story. October 7th. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=319.56s)]
*  What were you doing prior to that? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=321.76s)]
*  You chronicle in your book, you take impeccable notes along the way, not knowing this titanic event would take place. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=323.56s)]
*  What do you remember about that day? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=330.0s)]
*  On the morning of October 7th, I got a call from my producer at 7.03 in the morning and ultimately decided after speaking with my boss, Greg Heaton, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=332.72s)]
*  that we were heading to the south, our team here in Israel, to cover what was happening. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=342.72s)]
*  And we didn't really know what was happening at that time. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=347.04s)]
*  We knew that there were rockets being fired into southern and central Israel. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=348.92s)]
*  And so we did what we always do. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=351.68s)]
*  We headed toward the Gaza border. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=353.0s)]
*  And as we got closer and as the day went on and that morning went on, we started to realize this was not just a normal rocket attack. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=354.92s)]
*  And so I write about that story in my new book, Black Saturday. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=360.8s)]
*  It comes out tomorrow and it's going to allow readers not to just get my story and what it was like for our team behind the scenes, but also the stories of police officers, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=364.68s)]
*  of Israeli soldiers, of civilians, of hostages who were taken into Gaza and then later released as part of the November ceasefire agreement. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=372.6s)]
*  I also interviewed senior Hamas officials. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=379.32s)]
*  I also speak with Palestinian civilians. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=381.12s)]
*  It gives people a true understanding. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=382.84000000000003s)]
*  If you're someone who wants to know what it felt like to be in southern Israel on the morning of October 7th or what it was like in the early days of the war between Israel and Hamas inside Gaza, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=385.04s)]
*  this is the book. I mean, it has truly unprecedented access to what this was like in the early days of the conflict. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=394.08s)]
*  Trey Yengstar guest, he's calling us from somewhere in the Middle East. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=401.2s)]
*  Trey, now that you have such great contacts with Hamas, great contacts with Israel, great contact with Hezbollah and many others. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=403.84000000000003s)]
*  Can you give me your perspective? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=411.36s)]
*  What did what surprised Hamas about that day and what has surprised them about the response? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=412.32s)]
*  I think on that day, on October 7th, based on my reporting for this new book, I think they were most surprised by how far they got into Israel. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=420.68s)]
*  I think they thought there would be a heavier Israeli response that morning. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=428.96s)]
*  They were able to walk into dozens of areas of Israel and slaughter civilians in their homes. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=432.28000000000003s)]
*  They overtook army bases along the border and they did it with ease in many cases. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=436.96000000000004s)]
*  And so I think they were surprised about how easy it was to attack Israel on that morning, how unprepared the Israelis were. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=441.88s)]
*  And I think since then, in some ways, they've been surprised at the scale of the Israeli response, though Israeli officials will say, well, what did you expect? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=447.8s)]
*  But I dive into that in Black Saturday, too, because, you know, this is a really complex story. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=457.28000000000003s)]
*  And that's part of the reason that I thought it was important to speak with Palestinian civilians as well, because the Israeli response against Gaza has killed thousands of Hamas militants, but it's also killed thousands of civilians and displaced nearly the entire population of Gaza. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=462.0s)]
*  And so I think that's been a very shocking thing for the Palestinian people. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=474.64s)]
*  And as we look at the story moving forward, I don't think that even Hamas could have imagined on that day that this would have led to a year long conflict that really has no end in sight. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=478.96s)]
*  And that's the reality on the ground, Brian. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=490.15999999999997s)]
*  There is no end in sight. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=491.68s)]
*  And as we speak, we are in the back of an armored vehicle right now in northern Israel reporting on the war that has erupted between Israel and Hezbollah as a result of that attack on October 7. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=493.16s)]
*  And if you think if they would either one of those organizations, those terror organizations like to roll back time and not do this, eight thousand rockets later, they're losing, they lost their whole hierarchy, including their leader. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=503.96000000000004s)]
*  And now the whole country's in flames. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=517.12s)]
*  And now there might be looking at an invasion. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=519.44s)]
*  Hamas had 28 battalions. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=522.44s)]
*  I think they're down to one. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=523.96s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=526.7600000000001s)]
*  I mean, at the end of the day, this was not something that helped Hamas. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=527.72s)]
*  I mean, the majority of their leadership was also killed, like Hezbollah's. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=533.44s)]
*  And, you know, from our mindset, when we think about this, I always ask the question, what's the reason? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=537.32s)]
*  At the end of the day, what? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=543.2s)]
*  Why do this? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=544.72s)]
*  If you know, you'll be destroyed. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=545.64s)]
*  And I used to ask Hamas officials that when I would report inside Gaza before October 7, and their answer is often just based on the concept of resistance, resisting the Israeli blockade on Gaza and what they call the occupation of the West Bank and of East Jerusalem. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=546.84s)]
*  And part of our role is journalists to talk to them and try to understand why they do what they do. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=561.2s)]
*  And I think a lot of people will find that interesting in this new book because you get perspective that I don't think any other journalists on the ground in the world today is reporting. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=565.96s)]
*  And that is the access that we have our team on the ground in the Middle East. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=574.4399999999999s)]
*  You know, I speak with not just Hamas officials, but also pop Israeli officials, Israel's defense minister, Yoav Ghalem, the man calling the shots today about the war with Lebanon and specifically with Hezbollah. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=578.3199999999999s)]
*  I sit down with him exclusively multiple times and interview him about October 7 and the early days of the war. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=589.56s)]
*  And there's all this information that sort of takes the reader behind the scenes and all these questions that we had. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=595.52s)]
*  Some of them get answered in this book. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=601.12s)]
*  By the way, this might be your reporting, but this is what we have. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=604.3199999999999s)]
*  Senior U.S. officials tell Fox Israel will launch a limited ground incursion into South Lebanon. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=607.24s)]
*  Incursion is imminent, will be smaller in scale than in 2006 and last a shorter period of time. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=612.3199999999999s)]
*  So is that new to you? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=619.0799999999999s)]
*  I'm going to attribute what I know about that to that report that you just read. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=622.16s)]
*  But I think when you and I talk tomorrow morning on Fox and Friends, we're going to have more information on that. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=626.1999999999999s)]
*  OK, but look, the reality is we can tell you based on our reporting from before that there are a lot of Israeli forces in northern Israel. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=633.0s)]
*  They are preparing if the security cabinet decides to launch a limited ground invasion into southern Lebanon. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=641.0s)]
*  And the goal of such an invasion would be to remove Hezbollah positions from the border so that they can create a buffer zone and then ultimately return around tens of thousands of Israelis to their homes. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=646.04s)]
*  The name of the book is Black Saturday and Unfiltered, a counter to the October 7 attack on Israel and the war in Gaza. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=657.4799999999999s)]
*  You're going to get Trey's notes that nobody else had seen, including probably unless you were his producer, even people at Fox. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=662.1999999999999s)]
*  Trey, lastly, Iran has told these groups, I got you back. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=668.8399999999999s)]
*  I'm the parent organization. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=672.0s)]
*  I'll arm you. I'll train you. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=673.64s)]
*  Go out and go get Israel and kill Western interests. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=675.2s)]
*  Well, now these these both their organizations have been devastated. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=678.44s)]
*  I imagine they go, OK, Iran, watch our backs. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=681.84s)]
*  How much pressure is on Iran to act? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=684.72s)]
*  And what are you thinking they will do? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=687.6400000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of pressure on Iran. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=690.6s)]
*  Because what the leader of their proxy Hamas was killed, Ismail Ghania, at the inauguration ceremony for Masoud Peseski, the new president. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=691.72s)]
*  They found that it's quite embarrassment. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=699.84s)]
*  The leader of their top proxy across the Middle East, Hassan Nasrallah from Hezbollah, was also killed. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=702.2399999999999s)]
*  And so a lot of pressure. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=707.8s)]
*  They have a lot of open tabs in the region and they say they will respond. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=709.4799999999999s)]
*  Now we'll wait and see. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=713.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's a lot of pressure on them. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=715.3199999999999s)]
*  Is it true that you're reporting the Grand Ayatollah is in hiding now thinking he's next? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=716.7199999999999s)]
*  I've seen that. I've not been able to independently confirm it, but I have seen that reporting. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwKr2VBXTyM&t=723.2399999999999s)]
