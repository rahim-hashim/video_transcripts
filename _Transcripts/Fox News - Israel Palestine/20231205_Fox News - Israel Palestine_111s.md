# Israeli military raids Hamas' headquarters
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8N-hhxuPaw)
*  Turning now to the war in Israel. Overnight, the IDF says it raided Hamas's general security headquarters in Jabalia and are now surrounding areas of interest in northern Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8N-hhxuPaw&t=0.0s)]
*  And Trey Yanks is live on the ground this morning in southern Israel with the very latest. Hi, Trey. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8N-hhxuPaw&t=10.5s)]
*  Hey, Carly. Griff. Good morning. We do know overnight Israeli forces raided the Hamas general security headquarters in northern Gaza's Jabalia neighborhood. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8N-hhxuPaw&t=17.0s)]
*  This raid was conducted by two separate Israeli units, and they say they located rockets and weapons in the area before calling in airstrikes. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8N-hhxuPaw&t=27.0s)]
*  Israel is expected to complete offensive operations in northern Gaza in the coming weeks. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8N-hhxuPaw&t=36.0s)]
*  Also, in recent hours, Israel ramped up their campaign against southern Gaza. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8N-hhxuPaw&t=41.0s)]
*  Their efforts focused around the city of Hanunis, residents describing last night's airstrikes as the heaviest since the war began. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8N-hhxuPaw&t=45.0s)]
*  A source in the southern city of Rafa telling Fox News that cell service was temporarily cut in Gaza as the operation ramped up. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8N-hhxuPaw&t=52.0s)]
*  Amid the new push in the second phase of this war, the civilian death toll in Gaza is rising rapidly. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8N-hhxuPaw&t=59.0s)]
*  State Department spokesman Matt Miller discussed this before a briefing yesterday. Take a listen. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8N-hhxuPaw&t=64.0s)]
*  We do expect to see civilian casualties as a result of this campaign. That is sadly true in all wars. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8N-hhxuPaw&t=69.0s)]
*  It is especially going to be true in a war in a crowded urban environment where the opponent, Hamas, is using civilians as human shields and hiding themselves, hiding their fighters, hiding their infrastructure behind civilians. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8N-hhxuPaw&t=77.0s)]
*  We're getting this update in from northern Israel right now, indicating that Israeli fighter jets struck a number of Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon after multiple launches were detected earlier today toward the Jewish state. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8N-hhxuPaw&t=89.0s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8N-hhxuPaw&t=105.0s)]
*  Trey Yanks live for us in southern Israel. Trey, thank you so much. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8N-hhxuPaw&t=106.0s)]
