# Biden admin reportedly halts arms shipment to Israel
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [May 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs)
*  former president Donald Trump is back in court today where a judge has held him [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=0.0s)]
*  in contempt for a 10th time. That's for violating a gag order. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=5.08s)]
*  And now the judge is threatening Trump with possible jail time if he fails to [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=9.56s)]
*  comply going forward. We'll bring you all the breaking details there in just a [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=14.88s)]
*  moment. But first we are monitoring the developing situation in Rafa in the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=19.04s)]
*  Gaza Strip. President Biden and Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=23.72s)]
*  on the phone a short time ago as the Israeli army orders some 100,000 [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=28.38s)]
*  Palestinians to begin evacuating the city, signaling that a long promised [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=33.58s)]
*  ground invasion into the Hamas stronghold could be imminent. Hello, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=38.379999999999995s)]
*  everyone. This is Outnumbered. I'm Kaylee McEnany here with my co host [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=42.82s)]
*  Emily Campagno and Harris Faulkner. Also joining us Hudson Institute senior [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=46.019999999999996s)]
*  fellow Rebecca Heinrichs and Fox News contributor and host of the David Webb [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=50.58s)]
*  show on Sirius XM Patriot. You got it. That's David Webb. Well, we begin in [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=54.98s)]
*  Tel Aviv where Jeff Paul is standing by with the latest on Israel's expected [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=60.339999999999996s)]
*  ground operation into Rafa. Jeff. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=64.82s)]
*  Yeah, Kaylee, well, the IDF has been dropping these flyers in eastern Rafa [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=68.89999999999999s)]
*  urging civilians there to evacuate the Israeli military so far describing this [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=72.74s)]
*  as a limited scope operation, saying it is temporary and not a large scale [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=77.3s)]
*  evacuation. However, this is affecting roughly 100,000 Palestinians who live in [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=82.7s)]
*  eastern Rafa. The Israeli military has been urging them through not only phone [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=88.66s)]
*  calls but text messages and those flyers to move to the Mowasi humanitarian [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=93.42s)]
*  zone, which is along the coast north of Rafa. All this happening as ongoing [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=99.86s)]
*  negotiations between both Hamas and Israel appear to be collapsing. Hamas [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=104.25999999999999s)]
*  just left Egypt yesterday, ending the latest round of negotiations, but there [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=110.34s)]
*  are some reports they could be heading back tomorrow to continue those talks. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=114.02s)]
*  But on that same day yesterday, there was also a deadly mortar attack attack [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=118.22s)]
*  on the Kerem Shalom crossing that the IDF says was fired from an area near [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=122.42s)]
*  the humanitarian zone in Rafa. Hamas claimed responsibility and during a [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=126.82s)]
*  call with U. S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Israel's defense minister, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=131.3s)]
*  you have Galan said there is no choice left but to eventually conduct some [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=135.14s)]
*  sort of operation in Rafa. Galan says it appears Hamas really isn't serious [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=140.02s)]
*  about coming up with a new ceasefire deal. We are recognizing worrisome [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=144.22s)]
*  signals that Hamas is not planning to accept any deal or agreement with us. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=150.34s)]
*  And the meaning of this operation in Rafa and in the entire Gaza Strip in [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=154.62s)]
*  the very near future. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=159.9s)]
*  Now Hamas released a statement a little earlier today, saying any sort of ground [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=163.22s)]
*  operation into Rafa would not be a quote picnic, but we should mention the IDF [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=167.22s)]
*  has not signaled that this is the start of any sort of major ground operation [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=172.58s)]
*  there on the ground in Rafa. We'll have to see as we keep our eyes peeled on [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=178.22s)]
*  the latest developments back to you, Kayleigh. Keep us updated. Jeff Paul. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=182.74s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=186.22s)]
*  So I have here the president's readout, the White House readout of his [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=188.12s)]
*  conversation with Netanyahu. They talk about Holocaust Remembrance Day. They [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=191.06s)]
*  talk about the importance of humanitarian assistance getting to the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=196.18s)]
*  people, the Palestinian people. But there's this line at the end, Rebecca, and [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=199.70000000000002s)]
*  it's pretty pointed. It says the president reiterated his clear position [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=204.66s)]
*  on Rafa. Okay, so what's the president's position on Rafa? Well, let's pull up [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=208.9s)]
*  Axios. Last Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Israel [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=213.62s)]
*  and had a tough conversation with Netanyahu regarding a possible Israeli [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=218.42000000000002s)]
*  operation in Rafa. Two sources briefed on the meeting said Blinken told Netanyahu [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=223.14000000000001s)]
*  during the meeting that a major military operation in Rafa would lead to the U.S. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=227.22s)]
*  publicly opposing it and would negatively impact U.S.-Israel relations. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=232.42000000000002s)]
*  Just so our viewers understand, Hamas leaders, we believe, are underneath [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=237.62s)]
*  Rafa in those tunnels. So essentially, the U.S. government says sit back, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=242.26000000000002s)]
*  Netanyahu, wait for the next October 7th. Don't get rid of Hamas. That's the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=246.10000000000002s)]
*  translation. Right. Israel has no choice but to go into Rafa and to eliminate [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=250.46s)]
*  Hamas. This is the last major stronghold where Hamas is located. And if Israel [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=255.1s)]
*  carries out its campaign, its military campaign against Hamas and Rafa the way [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=260.74s)]
*  it has been conducting its military campaign, it will be very careful about [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=264.3s)]
*  noncombatants, that is, civilians. If you look at the way Israel has conducted [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=269.22s)]
*  this war, I mean, it has had an incredible vilification from the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=272.86s)]
*  international community and even now implied from the U.S. government itself. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=276.46000000000004s)]
*  But if you look at what actually it has done, it is really holding up the gold [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=280.26s)]
*  standard for a ground campaign. I mean, it has evacuated cities, 70 to 90 percent [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=284.82s)]
*  of civilians out of the area before it goes in. You know, the notorious roof [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=290.26s)]
*  knocking where it drops the munitions to warn civilians to get out of there. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=295.06s)]
*  It's even passed out maps to civilians about where the IDF is going to be [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=298.41999999999996s)]
*  operating, which really even gives itself a disadvantage because Hamas can [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=302.74s)]
*  then know where it's going to operate. And lastly, it has also created these [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=307.02s)]
*  humanitarian corridors where the IDF is facilitating civilians to leave the area [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=311.06s)]
*  and to protect them from Hamas because Hamas wants to kill the civilians and [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=315.9s)]
*  then blame the IDF to continue the vilification. So Israel has really set [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=320.18s)]
*  the gold standard for what it's doing to go after Hamas, protect civilians. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=324.5s)]
*  And the United States government should be giving Israel everything it needs to [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=328.74s)]
*  be able to do that, including the weapons that Congress just appropriated [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=332.09999999999997s)]
*  So to that end, Harris, I think that's an important point. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=335.62s)]
*  Congress gives 26 billion dollars for Israel. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=339.54s)]
*  This was allocated by our legislature. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=342.86s)]
*  And then over the weekend, we get this headline. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=345.98s)]
*  U.S. put a hold on an ammunition shipment to Israel. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=347.86s)]
*  Now, maybe there was some sort of complication. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=351.78000000000003s)]
*  We don't have all the details, but a more sinister interpretation could be [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=353.78000000000003s)]
*  this is a signal to Israel. Our support is not unequivocal. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=358.62s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think it's sinister. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=361.82s)]
*  It's sinister. I think it's logical. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=363.18s)]
*  I mean, they couldn't get an outright bill through in and out of the House and [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=365.18s)]
*  in and out of the Senate and to the president's desk for aid for for [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=370.26s)]
*  singularly Israel. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=373.65999999999997s)]
*  So I think it's logical to think at this point if they're now at the behest of [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=375.41999999999996s)]
*  people like Nancy Pelosi, former Speaker of the House twice, so on and so forth. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=379.46s)]
*  At the behest of some Democrats, many of them very powerful, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=383.38s)]
*  they didn't want to give any more aid to Israel for the for ammunition. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=387.02s)]
*  So if they're holding it back, it's not sinister. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=391.42s)]
*  I mean, it is. They are a number one ally in that region. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=394.42s)]
*  But it's also just logical on the part of how how much can you flex for the [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=397.74s)]
*  Democratic Party? That's definitely in the playbook. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=401.82s)]
*  My question is, what about all those other countries that you just signed that aid [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=404.62s)]
*  bill for, you know, for Ukraine? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=407.86s)]
*  If you're sitting in Ukraine and you know that Russia moved in before the aid and [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=410.74s)]
*  the weapons showed up and blah, blah, blah, blah, what if it looks like you're [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=414.54s)]
*  not winning? Would we do that to that, you know, friend and ally as well? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=418.38s)]
*  They're not a member of NATO, but we've clearly shown that we care about them. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=422.26s)]
*  Like how far will Biden flex? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=425.5s)]
*  I do want to get this in, though. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=427.94s)]
*  So the phone call that wrapped up about 30 minutes, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=429.3s)]
*  they were on the phone, Benjamin Netanyahu and the president. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=433.62s)]
*  First, they talked about the Holocaust Remembrance Day. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=436.62s)]
*  So this is about an hour and a half ago. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=439.1s)]
*  They spent 30 minutes on the phone. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=440.62s)]
*  The two leaders talked about one of the darkest chapters in the Holocaust in human [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=441.94s)]
*  history. And then Biden updated the prime minister on efforts to secure a hostage [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=446.34s)]
*  deal. We don't often hear Biden talk about the hostages. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=451.61999999999995s)]
*  So he did with Netanyahu. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=454.09999999999997s)]
*  Apparently this is from the White House, including ongoing talks today with Doha [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=455.5s)]
*  Cutter. The prime minister agreed to ensure the Karim Shalom crossing is open for [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=460.06s)]
*  humanitarian assistance for those in need. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=464.53999999999996s)]
*  The president of the United States reiterated his clear position on Rafa. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=466.9s)]
*  They want to go into the last stronghold to get Hamas. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=471.41999999999996s)]
*  Israel does. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=474.17999999999995s)]
*  The president doesn't want them to do that. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=475.38s)]
*  They can do what they want. They are a sovereign nation. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=477.26s)]
*  They are a sovereign nation. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=479.74s)]
*  You know, Emily, I think what Rebecca said was really important, the great pains that [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=481.3s)]
*  Israel goes to to make sure that they don't hit civilians. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=484.58s)]
*  The single best description I've heard of Israel and put into just the scheme of [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=488.74s)]
*  world history, what they're doing versus let's say what we've done as a country. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=494.1s)]
*  Let's watch. This is Professor Scott Galloway. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=498.14s)]
*  Listen very closely to these numbers. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=500.5s)]
*  Twenty two hundred American servicemen killed at Pearl Harbor. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=502.54s)]
*  We go on to kill three and a half million Japanese, including one hundred thousand one [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=505.7s)]
*  nine. Twenty eight hundred Americans in 9-eleven. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=509.06s)]
*  We go on to kill four hundred thousand people in Afghanistan and Iraq. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=512.18s)]
*  We weren't accused of genocide, but Jews are not allowed and Israel is not allowed to [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=516.02s)]
*  prosecute a war and they are prosecuting a war more humanely than we have done. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=520.54s)]
*  The ratio of combatants to civilians is of civilian death to combatant mortality. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=524.42s)]
*  Combatant mortality is lower than it was in Mosul, lower than it was in Japan, lower [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=531.38s)]
*  was in Germany. So there's just a different standard for Jews in Israel. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=535.82s)]
*  Those are facts. Why is there a different standard for Jews in Israel? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=542.1800000000001s)]
*  He has he is absolutely right. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=545.58s)]
*  And I have to point out that, you know, we are not here to discuss the morality of [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=547.46s)]
*  those heavy handed responses, but instead the reality right now that our president [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=552.58s)]
*  has prevented Israel from ending things. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=558.3s)]
*  There is no better recipe for a continued abscess, for a continued fomenting than to [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=561.54s)]
*  let the enemy fizzle and let our allies fizzle. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=567.9399999999999s)]
*  He is doing the same thing with Ukraine as he is doing with Israel, which is placing [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=572.62s)]
*  so much handcuffs on these allies, placing so many demands on the aid that we give. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=576.8199999999999s)]
*  But the exception is that with Ukraine, he's publicly incredibly supportive. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=583.8599999999999s)]
*  We don't have that for Israel, that there is no way for these countries to adequately [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=587.1s)]
*  defend themselves and end it right now. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=591.9s)]
*  The Ukraine situation has been dragging on for well over a year. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=593.66s)]
*  If we had just given them what they asked for right away, they could have ended for [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=596.86s)]
*  Israel. We are now ignoring our own history, our own precedent to say exercise restraint. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=600.7s)]
*  And now Israel is fomenting, is being subject to a fomented situation because their [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=606.22s)]
*  because Hamas is essentially being given whatever they want because our allies have been [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=613.26s)]
*  given what they want. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=617.9s)]
*  And as we think about Holocaust remembrance day, I think Netanyahu said it best and the [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=619.5s)]
*  terrible Holocaust. There were great world leaders who stood by idly. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=623.06s)]
*  Therefore, the first lesson of the Holocaust is if we do not defend ourselves, nobody will [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=626.34s)]
*  defend us. And if we need to stand alone, we will stand alone. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=630.62s)]
*  Yeah. You know, my friend Tibor Hollow died last Tuesday. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=634.02s)]
*  I was at his funeral on Friday. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=637.58s)]
*  We sat Shiva. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=639.98s)]
*  They're still sitting Shiva today. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=641.14s)]
*  He survived Auschwitz. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=643.3s)]
*  He survived a second camp. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=644.9s)]
*  His mother, they never saw her again after Auschwitz. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=646.66s)]
*  His father and he were moved to another camp. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=649.66s)]
*  What he lived to see today. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=653.02s)]
*  I can't even imagine what that means. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=656.9399999999999s)]
*  This was someone who went on and up to he was 97 years old to teach others the lessons [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=659.66s)]
*  of this. The equivocation by the or the false equivocation by the Biden [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=665.74s)]
*  administration is a lie. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=670.9s)]
*  Rebecca pointed out what Israel does. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=676.26s)]
*  There are so many steps before a strike. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=678.26s)]
*  I have been there. I have seen this play out. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=680.86s)]
*  I have been briefed on this is something they do to preserve life because of their [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=683.78s)]
*  belief in life. If they're not sure it's a terrorist, they will not strike. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=687.42s)]
*  It's that simple at times. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=692.26s)]
*  And they are faced with people who will strike at them, strike at aid workers. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=695.02s)]
*  They had ambulances earlier today and so much more. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=699.66s)]
*  Yep. And keep in mind, there are five American hostages. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=703.38s)]
*  There are babies. Kofir Bevis, his brother, Ariel Bevis. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXv2pzC6lGs&t=707.42s)]
