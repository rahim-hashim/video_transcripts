# Israel targets 'top of the food chain' Hezbollah leader in latest attack
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [September 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w)
*  to bring you in on right now, and it is happening in the Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=0.0s)]
*  A new attack by Israel into Lebanon, and Trey Yanks joins me now with the details that he [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=4.64s)]
*  has so far. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=11.68s)]
*  Hi, Trey. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=12.68s)]
*  Trey Yanks, The New York Times. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=13.68s)]
*  Yeah, Martha, massive breaking news right now out of the Middle East. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=14.68s)]
*  Fox News has learned that the Israeli military targeted the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=18.52s)]
*  in the suburbs of Beirut. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=26.2s)]
*  A massive explosion was reported there this hour. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=28.08s)]
*  Israeli fighter jets overhead. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=32.12s)]
*  We are learning this information in real time. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=34.64s)]
*  It is unclear if the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in the strike. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=36.96s)]
*  But again, the latest information that we have, Fox News has learned that Hassan Nasrallah [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=42.96s)]
*  was the target of this large strike in the Lebanese capital of Beirut. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=47.44s)]
*  Nasrallah is at the top of the food chain for this Iran-backed group responsible for [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=52.6s)]
*  firing thousands of rockets into northern and central Israel since October 8th. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=57.44s)]
*  He's a man who took over for Hezbollah leadership in 1992 and has led the organization since, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  you might remember, the second Lebanon war back in 2006. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=70.52s)]
*  Following that 31-day conflict, Nasrallah said had he known the destruction that would [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=74.8s)]
*  come to Lebanon, he would not have launched the war that took place then. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=79.8s)]
*  If this is confirmed and the death of Nasrallah is confirmed here in the Middle East, it [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=85.04s)]
*  is an unprecedented moment. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=90.28s)]
*  And remember what it follows. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  It follows a speech earlier today by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the UN [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=93.68s)]
*  General Assembly and also a visit by Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Galant to troops in [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=99.4s)]
*  the northern part of this country who are staging for the possibility of a ground operation [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=105.28s)]
*  into southern Lebanon. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=110.48s)]
*  So right now we are waiting to gather more details. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=112.64s)]
*  You can see right there, there is smoke rising, and I believe that's a skyline shot from [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=115.36s)]
*  Beirut following this massive strike. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=120.64s)]
*  Journalists on the ground in the Lebanese capital report hearing multiple explosions. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=124.0s)]
*  And Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, the top spokesman for the Israeli military, said publicly that [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=128.74s)]
*  the target of this strike was the command and control center underneath a building in [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=134.36s)]
*  the Lebanese capital. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=140.04s)]
*  And again, Fox News has learned at this hour that the target of the strike was Hezbollah [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=141.6s)]
*  leader Hassan Nasrallah. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  Martha? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=147.48s)]
*  Trey Yanks, thank you very much. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=148.48s)]
*  Obviously, this is an enormous story with huge implications as we wait to find out what [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  the impact of that strike was on command and control centers in Beirut, Lebanon. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=158.04s)]
*  And as Trey has just confirmed, the target was Hassan Nasrallah, who has been in power [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=164.44s)]
*  since 1992 in Lebanon as the head of Hezbollah, and he has lost almost all of his deputies [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=170.02s)]
*  underneath him. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=177.78s)]
*  I think two of the main core leadership underneath him remain after these hits in this current [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=178.78s)]
*  and ongoing war. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=185.1s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=186.1s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilme. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlad8NSV3w&t=187.1s)]
