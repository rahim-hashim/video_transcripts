# Expert blasts Schumer for sharp comments against Netanyahu: He should be ‘ashamed’
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [March 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec)
*  For more on this, let's bring in our political panel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=0.0s)]
*  With us today is talk show host Tony Katz and also ARC Initiative senior advisor Tim [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=3.64s)]
*  Hogan. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=9.68s)]
*  Both of you watched this unfold this week. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  I'm sure the drama between what Chuck Schumer said and reaction coming from Republicans [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  across the spectrum. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=20.5s)]
*  I want to ask you, Tony, because you'll recall, I mean, just a couple years ago when President [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=23.04s)]
*  Biden said of Russian President Putin, that man cannot stay in power right after the Ukraine [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=27.88s)]
*  invasion, the White House was bending over backwards to say that Biden was actually not [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=35.16s)]
*  calling for regime change. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  He wasn't calling for, you know, him to step down from office. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=40.84s)]
*  They really carefully walked that back. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  And that was talking about Putin. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=48.379999999999995s)]
*  They did not do this with Netanyahu, our ally in Israel. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=50.36s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=54.599999999999994s)]
*  Because the Biden administration is not a friend of Israel and doesn't care what happens to [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=57.24s)]
*  Israel. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=60.96s)]
*  He isn't strong on Israel. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=61.96s)]
*  He had some really big words soon after October 7th, the attack from the Hamas terrorists [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  on Israelis, the murder of 1300, the burning alive of babies, the raping of women. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  And then it all fell apart. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=73.48s)]
*  And now he's going to build a port for Hamas. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=75.0s)]
*  This is not a pier in the Mediterranean. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=78.02000000000001s)]
*  He's building a port in Hamas. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=80.22s)]
*  I got back from Israel last Thursday. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=82.2s)]
*  I spent a week there. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=84.16s)]
*  I was at the site of the music festival in Raim. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=85.24s)]
*  I was in the kibbutzim that were burned down with the bullet holes, the death and the destruction [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=88.28s)]
*  in the north just a mile from Lebanon, where they are expecting the war with Hezbollah. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  Israelis are completely united in support of destroying Hamas and destroying Hezbollah. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=99.96s)]
*  They may not be fans of Netanyahu. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=104.78s)]
*  That is true. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=106.52s)]
*  But for Chuck Schumer to call for elections, when does Chuck Schumer call for elections [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=107.52s)]
*  when it comes to Hamas, when it comes to Hezbollah? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=113.2s)]
*  When does that happen? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  The answer is it hasn't happened. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=118.84s)]
*  Chuck Schumer should be ashamed of himself. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=120.48s)]
*  Tim, you know, the White House has, you know, despite responding to some of the pressure [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  from its base to be more sensitive to the civilian toll in Gaza, with their actions, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=127.78s)]
*  they have continued to maintain support for Israel. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=133.76s)]
*  But this was a really stunning moment where, you know, the president said that it was a [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=136.16s)]
*  good speech. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=141.32s)]
*  The White House couldn't say exactly what was good about that speech, maintained that [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  they weren't walking it back, but also didn't endorse it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=146.51999999999998s)]
*  I mean, that requires some clarification. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=148.76s)]
*  It's not an explicit endorsement because the entire situation in the Middle East right [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=151.2s)]
*  now is about walking a diplomatic tightrope. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=154.62s)]
*  And to your point, the reason we've been able to continue to help Israel to build a pier [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=157.48s)]
*  and a port to try to get aid into Gaza, to help people where we've seen massive civilian [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=162.16s)]
*  casualties is because the administration has taken a responsible posture on the issue. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=169.28s)]
*  We've seen Tony Blinken negotiating for getting aid through the Ra'afah crossing. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=174.96s)]
*  We have seen Jake Sullivan and the National Security Council maintain a responsible posture. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=180.16s)]
*  Well, the question is, do you want to throw someone like Donald Trump into the situation [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=184.0s)]
*  where it's totally bombastic, where he's saying, you know, it is just going to be, you know, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  whatever Netanyahu's government wants is going to be the policy. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=194.36s)]
*  Can we stop this? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=197.88s)]
*  Can we please stop this? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=199.44s)]
*  This has nothing to do with Donald Trump. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=200.76s)]
*  It isn't responsible to build a port for Hamas. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=202.67999999999998s)]
*  It is a choice that people are going to make in November, and it's about having someone [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=203.95999999999998s)]
*  responsible or a flamethrower. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=209.16s)]
*  There is absolutely, positively no diplomatic tightrope. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=211.64s)]
*  You either favor terrorists or you don't. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=216.04s)]
*  You either favor the burning of babies or you don't. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=218.23999999999998s)]
*  And right now the Biden administration is saying they do. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=221.2s)]
*  They're wrong, and Chuck Schumer's wrong, and you're wrong, Tim. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=224.04s)]
*  That's the type of rhetoric that we would see coming out of the White House and we don't want that. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=226.4s)]
*  I think the two of you guys certainly shows that there are strong feelings on both sides [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=229.44000000000003s)]
*  of this issue that are not going away anytime soon, and everything that the president does matters. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=232.52s)]
*  Which is why I think the White House should probably clarify their stance, because people [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=238.92000000000002s)]
*  are looking for answers. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=244.28000000000003s)]
*  Appreciate your time, both of you. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=245.76000000000002s)]
*  Hope to have you back again soon. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTHZ8Llohec&t=247.12s)]
