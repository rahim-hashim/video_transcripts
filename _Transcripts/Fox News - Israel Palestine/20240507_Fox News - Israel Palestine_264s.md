# 'UNBELIEVABLE': 'Squad' member fundraises alongside pro-Hamas leader
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [May 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw)
*  President Biden is set to deliver a keynote address on anti-Semitism at the Capitol today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=0.0s)]
*  But don't expect him to visit college campuses dealing with the anti-Israel protests. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=5.84s)]
*  Congressman Ro Khanna said that the president should and will be out visiting these campuses [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=10.16s)]
*  amid the protests. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=16.64s)]
*  Is there any plan for him to get out there and talk to students right now? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=17.64s)]
*  As quick note from Korean Jean-Pierre, Dov Hikind is a former Democrat and the founder [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=24.16s)]
*  of Americans Against Anti-Semitism. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=28.02s)]
*  And he joins me now, Dov. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=30.42s)]
*  Good morning to you. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=31.86s)]
*  Incredible time for President Biden to be making this keynote address on anti-Semitism [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=32.86s)]
*  today. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=37.94s)]
*  What would you like to hear from the president? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=38.94s)]
*  Well, I don't think I'm going to hear anything that I want to hear. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=40.980000000000004s)]
*  The president is busy appeasement 2024, undermining Israel, holding Israel back, playing games, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=45.46s)]
*  people in his administration, undermining the prime minister of Israel. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=55.58s)]
*  The job could have been finished with the terrorists of Hamas, the Nazis of 2024. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=61.019999999999996s)]
*  And the Biden administration is busy dealing with its election in November. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=67.4s)]
*  That's what this is all about. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=74.53999999999999s)]
*  It's not about principle. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=76.1s)]
*  It's not about doing the right thing. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=77.34s)]
*  Whatever comes out of the White House in terms of anti-Semitism, it's just not to be believed [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=81.1s)]
*  and not real. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=87.74s)]
*  And I don't accept it. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=89.41999999999999s)]
*  I do not trust Biden. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=90.58s)]
*  I do not trust his administration. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=92.78s)]
*  He is busy placating the radicals in the Democratic Party like AOC, Tlaib, Omar, and the list [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=95.17999999999999s)]
*  goes on and on. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=102.97999999999999s)]
*  That's what this is all about. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=104.86s)]
*  It's about the betrayal of the Biden administration of the people of Israel. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=106.42s)]
*  Dove, do you think that Jewish Democrats are doing enough to voice these concerns to President [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=110.98s)]
*  Biden? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=115.86s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=118.46000000000001s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=120.1s)]
*  Unfortunately, we know who the bad people are, the radicals, but good people are not [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=121.38s)]
*  doing the right thing by speaking out, by being out there. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=127.26s)]
*  Things are out of control, for God's sake. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=131.62s)]
*  The Jewish community, people are afraid. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=134.38s)]
*  People are asking me, when do you think the time will be that we need to leave America? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=137.26s)]
*  That's what people are asking me. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=143.94s)]
*  I mean, that is a sad commentary on what's going on in our great country. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=145.26s)]
*  These are people who hate America, the people in the streets. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=150.7s)]
*  They burn the American flag. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=153.85999999999999s)]
*  They desecrate memorials. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=155.72s)]
*  Okay? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=158.14s)]
*  Down with America. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=159.14s)]
*  They hate this country. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=160.44s)]
*  Let's get that clear. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=162.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=163.3s)]
*  Well, Dove, on that front, there is Congressman Jamal Bowman. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=164.3s)]
*  He's a member of the progressive squad, Congressman out of New York. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=166.74s)]
*  He recently attended a fundraiser co-hosted by the co-founder of CARE, whose name is Nihad [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=170.54000000000002s)]
*  Awad, who expressed happiness in the October 7th terror attacks. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=176.18s)]
*  Bowman's facing a tough primary challenge. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=180.82000000000002s)]
*  What do you think about his attendance in this fundraiser and if this could possibly [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=183.38000000000002s)]
*  move the needle for him in his reelection campaign? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=187.58s)]
*  Well, I hope he is going to be defeated. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=190.86s)]
*  I believe he will be defeated. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=193.5s)]
*  I mean, we're talking here. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=195.5s)]
*  Let's get this clear. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=198.66000000000003s)]
*  This is not about support for Palestinians. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=199.66000000000003s)]
*  This is support for Hamas, the ones who massacred, the ones who raped, the ones who brutalized [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=202.74s)]
*  the barbarians of our generation, Hamas. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=211.62s)]
*  You have people like Bowman and others supporting Hamas, working with people who support these [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=215.82s)]
*  terrorists. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=223.89999999999998s)]
*  I mean, it is unbelievable. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=224.89999999999998s)]
*  Look, Democrats, we must, you know, I'm speaking to Democrats. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=226.42s)]
*  Stay a Democrat. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=232.1s)]
*  That's fine with me. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=233.1s)]
*  But you must defeat Democrats. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=234.57999999999998s)]
*  Just imagine if the Democrat Party wins the House of Representatives. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=237.12s)]
*  AOC will be the chairperson of the Foreign Affairs Committee, for God's sake. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=240.86s)]
*  Bowman and the rest of that group will be running this country. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=245.82s)]
*  Well, you went to Israel following the October 7th terror attacks. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=248.74s)]
*  I'm sure those images are etched in your memory forever. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=252.02s)]
*  And I think people in this country need to be reminded of them. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=255.26s)]
*  Dov, thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=259.42s)]
*  You appreciate it. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=262.22s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weB-vF4GSpw&t=263.22s)]
