# Mother of hostage held by Hamas: I worry about my son
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8)
*  While these dozens of Israeli hostages have been reunited with loved ones in the past [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=0.0s)]
*  few days, including today, many others are still waiting for that to happen. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=4.84s)]
*  Dual U.S.-Israeli citizen Hirsch Goldberg-Pollin was at the Supernova Music Festival when Hamas [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=10.28s)]
*  attacked back on October 7th. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=15.76s)]
*  His arm was blown off by a grenade before he was loaded into a truck at gunpoint. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  His mother has not stopped fighting for his safe return since. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=22.68s)]
*  Rachel Goldberg joins us now. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=26.68s)]
*  Rachel, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=28.92s)]
*  As hard as this is, I can only imagine what you have been through. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=31.040000000000003s)]
*  What is your message right now as we continue to watch what is happening there and more [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=35.58s)]
*  hostages have been turned over? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=40.64s)]
*  Well, first of all, I am actually thrilled with how the progression of these hostages [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  being returned. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=54.98s)]
*  Especially, I just saw right now because I had been on calls until I just was waiting [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=55.98s)]
*  for you guys to let me in, I just saw that a dear friend of ours, wife and daughter were [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=62.419999999999995s)]
*  released tonight. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=70.3s)]
*  I can't describe how happy these last few nights of seeing these children going back [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=73.66s)]
*  of seeing these women and daughters and sisters and mothers going back to their families. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=81.44s)]
*  So that's been incredible. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=88.52s)]
*  And I'm very aware that all of these deals are held together by the thinnest of threads. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=90.8s)]
*  And my message, first of all, is I hope that we can keep doing this. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=99.28s)]
*  I hope that aid that is desperately needed in Gaza gets to where it needs to be. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=104.88s)]
*  And I hope that more and more hostages are released. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=112.6s)]
*  I would love bigger numbers of hostages because I think having 10 at a time leaves a lot of [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=116.36s)]
*  room for that delicate thread to break at some point. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=122.36s)]
*  And of course, I worry about my son, who I know was in critical condition, is now permanently [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=128.84s)]
*  for the rest of his life without a limb. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=135.92s)]
*  And I'm concerned for his health. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=138.79999999999998s)]
*  I don't know if he's getting the antibiotics that he needs. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=144.76s)]
*  I'm hoping that he got the surgery that he needed. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=147.48s)]
*  So I'm very concerned, but I am thrilled with the releases of all of these hostages who [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=150.52s)]
*  have gone through the ones released today, have gone through 53 days of being held in [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=159.16000000000003s)]
*  a terrible condition, in a traumatic way. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=168.32000000000002s)]
*  Hi Rachel, it's John Roberts here along with Sandra. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=174.20000000000002s)]
*  We can't imagine the conditions and the fear that all of these folks have been living with [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=176.68s)]
*  for the last 53 days. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  The fact that Mia Shem, who was one of the first hostages released, who had a serious [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=185.8s)]
*  wound to her upper arm and did receive medical care at the hands of a Palestinian doctor, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  I'm sure that that potentially gives you some comfort that Hershey's wounds were attended to. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=197.16s)]
*  I am so hopeful that hearing that several, and in fact, Maya Regev was released two days [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=205.72s)]
*  ago, she's 21, and she was at that same music festival that Hershey was at. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=215.44s)]
*  And she was shot in the leg, I believe, two or three times, and she was treated. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=220.72s)]
*  And that gave me a lot of hope that, you know, I know that there are plenty of talented doctors [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=227.92s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=232.51999999999998s)]
*  And I know that the surgery that Hershey needed when his arm was blown off, we spoke to trauma [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=234.28s)]
*  surgeons all over to find out what kind of, and they looked at the video, we had video [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=239.56s)]
*  of his arm that was blown off, and they looked at it frame by frame and explained to us that [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  the procedure he needed was actually not complicated. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=253.64000000000001s)]
*  A general surgeon could do it because what they really needed to do was to go where the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=256.6s)]
*  messy, you know, exploded part was and just go above it and amputate, which is a relatively, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=262.4s)]
*  I mean, it sounds horrible, but it's a relatively straightforward surgery. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=270.15999999999997s)]
*  And if he got that and then was able to get, the bigger concern is afterwards, if you get [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=274.71999999999997s)]
*  the antibiotics that you need so that sepsis doesn't sink in and infection doesn't sink in. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  You know, so I am hopeful that they took care of him. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=287.28s)]
*  And I've been hopeful all along that, you know, I know there are plenty of good people [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=291.96s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=297.55999999999995s)]
*  I hope that somebody is being kind to my son. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=298.55999999999995s)]
*  We pray that is the case. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=303.32s)]
*  And to hear the hope coming from you, it keeps us all alive and we're praying for him. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=305.03999999999996s)]
*  And that hope is coming from what you just said was that the friend and her daughter [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=310.2s)]
*  that you've been following so closely, Mia Leinberg, 17 years old, was among those released [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=315.48s)]
*  in this latest batch. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=321.88s)]
*  Gabriella Leinberg, 59 years old, the mother of that teenager released. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=323.6s)]
*  The daughter, the 17 year old girl was kidnapped with her family dog, Bella. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=329.08000000000004s)]
*  It's a story that we have all been following throughout this. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=333.76s)]
*  Mia is in the bottom middle there, her mother just to the left there of her photo. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=336.16s)]
*  And what an incredible story this is. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=341.76s)]
*  And we'll wait. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=345.12s)]
*  We'll wait to see what they hear about their time in captivity, Rachel. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=346.12s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, we're thrilled. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=349.48s)]
*  I'm thrilled for their, respectively, the father and husband of Gabriella and Mia, who [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=352.32s)]
*  is now a dear friend. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=358.84000000000003s)]
*  He actually went, last week we went to Rome and met with the Pope. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=360.56s)]
*  And it was there, you know, it was Mr. Leinberg who was with us. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=365.76s)]
*  I'm just, I'm over the moon for him. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=373.04s)]
*  He has his family back. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=376.16s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, but at the same time, you again sit here waiting and wondering what the status [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=377.76s)]
*  of Hershey is and whether he will ever come out. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=384.08s)]
*  We heard maybe some words of encouragement from the IDF just moments ago. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=386.92s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Konrick has joined us to say that there was a 10 day window on [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=390.6s)]
*  this ceasefire. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=395.32s)]
*  And if 10 hostages or 12 hostages were released every day for 10 days, that would pretty much [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=397.32s)]
*  account for all of the hostages that remain. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=402.09999999999997s)]
*  It wouldn't. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=405.09999999999997s)]
*  There's still 170. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=406.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=408.14s)]
*  So, well, if you had 12 over 10 days, 120, maybe you add to that. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=408.85999999999996s)]
*  I mean, he was suggesting that it would it would come close. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=414.09999999999997s)]
*  But you mentioned. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=417.53999999999996s)]
*  I would love it. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=418.78s)]
*  You mentioned that you visited with the Pope. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=419.97999999999996s)]
*  You also visited with another sort of famous person the other day at the home of the president, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=422.58s)]
*  Isaac Herzog, Elon Musk. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=428.5s)]
*  What did you say to Mr. Musk? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=431.46000000000004s)]
*  So similar to what I did with the Pope is I showed him the video that I have of Hershey [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=435.22s)]
*  being taken by gunpoint with his left arm missing from the elbow down, being loaded onto a [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=442.1s)]
*  pickup truck. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=451.14000000000004s)]
*  And and at the end, there's a young man also who's around 21, 22. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=452.46000000000004s)]
*  I don't know his age. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=460.54s)]
*  I don't know this boy who was picked up by his hair and thrown on to the pickup truck. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=461.62s)]
*  It's a very short video. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=468.06s)]
*  It's 45 seconds, I think. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=469.46000000000004s)]
*  And I shared it with him. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=472.14000000000004s)]
*  You know, you guys are journalists. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=475.38s)]
*  Words mean a lot, but a picture is worth a thousand words. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=478.18s)]
*  And I think a video is worth a million words. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=481.90000000000003s)]
*  And he he was very obviously concerned, expressed sympathy. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=485.5s)]
*  I think it was a very he had had a very emotional day. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=498.14s)]
*  He had gone down with the prime minister and seen the situation at some of the kibbutzim [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=501.9s)]
*  that were struck. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=508.58s)]
*  And he also heard you see in that picture that you're showing, there were four families [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=509.62s)]
*  that each of us told about our loved one who who was kidnapped. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=515.26s)]
*  And, you know, it was a very human moment. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=520.8199999999999s)]
*  Well, we also know that there is still a 10 month old baby being held captive. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=525.34s)]
*  And the aunt, the great aunt of that baby was on this network earlier. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=530.6999999999999s)]
*  Family speaking out, saying bring this baby home now, 10 month old in captivity. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=536.58s)]
*  She makes the case that Hamas is stalling by saying that they don't know where some [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=543.7800000000001s)]
*  of these hostages are. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=548.22s)]
*  And Rachel, I wanted to get your response to this. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=549.58s)]
*  Listen. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=551.5400000000001s)]
*  There are different groups inside the Gaza Strip. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=553.22s)]
*  Hamas is controlling their powerfully. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=555.82s)]
*  And I think in my opinion, again, that's saying that they don't know where they are is [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=559.4599999999999s)]
*  another way of stalling and buying time. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=566.9s)]
*  Your response to that, Rachel. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=570.3s)]
*  You know, I really have no idea. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=573.2199999999999s)]
*  Honestly, I don't presume to understand what's happening in Gaza right now. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=575.06s)]
*  I do think from what I understand, there is a lot of chaos. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=581.6999999999999s)]
*  Remember, there's a lot of displaced people. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=587.82s)]
*  There's a lot of destroyed buildings. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=592.1s)]
*  I think there's total pandemonium and chaos. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=594.02s)]
*  And so I don't know if it's as you thought was suggesting, if it's that they're [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=596.98s)]
*  they're pretending that they don't know where people are or if in fact, because of all [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=602.86s)]
*  of the pandemonium and chaos. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=607.82s)]
*  And I don't think even starting from October 7th, I don't think that it was the most [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=609.5400000000001s)]
*  organized situation. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=614.18s)]
*  I don't think the plan was to have 240 people spanning an age from eight months old to [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=618.22s)]
*  an 87 year old Holocaust survivor, to people from 30 different countries, to people who [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=624.26s)]
*  are Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Hindu and Buddhist. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=630.8199999999999s)]
*  I don't think they planned. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=634.78s)]
*  I don't think they've been realized, you know, that it was like a mad grab. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=636.14s)]
*  I don't I don't know. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=641.26s)]
*  So I don't know how to predict or explain what what is taking place there now. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=642.5s)]
*  I just am a mom and I want my only son to come home to me. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=650.38s)]
*  I'll take him with one arm. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=656.62s)]
*  We'll make him OK. We need him back. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=659.3s)]
*  We can't even begin to imagine the pain as a mother that you are going through. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=662.22s)]
*  As we pointed out, the photograph with you and Elon Musk and Isaac Hertz, you've had a [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=666.82s)]
*  chance to be in proximity to Israeli leaders. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=671.58s)]
*  They keep saying that at some point, kinetic military operations have to resume in order [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=675.4200000000001s)]
*  to prevent October 7th from ever happening again. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=680.7s)]
*  What what is your message to them about that and maintaining the ceasefire in hopes that [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=684.26s)]
*  all of the hostages can come home? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=691.4200000000001s)]
*  Well, I'm not a politician and I'm not a military strategist or tactician. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=695.1s)]
*  As I said before, I'm a mom and I think it must be very difficult if you have a two pronged [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=702.4200000000001s)]
*  approach and they feel that they are in conflict with each other. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=711.0600000000001s)]
*  So I don't presume to understand or know how you go about a military, you know, maneuver [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=718.1800000000001s)]
*  trying to wipe out something that is an idea. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=728.34s)]
*  I don't know how you wipe out an idea. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=733.58s)]
*  I do agree that October 7th can never happen again, that we need to be safe. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=737.5s)]
*  Citizens need to not be afraid to go to sleep in their beds. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=747.02s)]
*  Citizens, young people need to not be afraid to go to a music festival that was called [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=752.1800000000001s)]
*  the Music Festival of Unity and Light. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=758.46s)]
*  So we have two seemingly a bit conflicting objectives, and I'm very hopeful that we can [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=763.58s)]
*  become creative and insightful and use our intellect and figure out ways to help others [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=773.9s)]
*  in ways that we are not constantly returning to this cycle of violence, not just in our [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=781.46s)]
*  neck of the woods, but all around the world. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=786.98s)]
*  That seems that always it's the innocent people who suffer the most. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=789.86s)]
*  And I just don't see it as ultimately being very productive to constantly be returning [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=795.78s)]
*  to this cycle of revenge, violence, hatred, pain, revenge, violence, hatred, pain. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=801.5400000000001s)]
*  Familiar to us. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=808.58s)]
*  It's very known to us. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=810.1s)]
*  I don't know that it's really working for us as as a planet or as a human race. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=811.78s)]
*  Rachel, we are praying for your family and for your son, your only son. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=818.26s)]
*  We hear you. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=823.06s)]
*  You just want him home. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=824.06s)]
*  Twenty three years old. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=825.98s)]
*  You know, as the time passes, we've noted that some of these hostages have been in [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=827.38s)]
*  captivity during birthdays. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=831.54s)]
*  Is it does he have one coming up? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=834.02s)]
*  He's 23, correct? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=835.82s)]
*  Actually, he turned 23 on October 3rd. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=838.58s)]
*  He was at the festival celebrating his birthday. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=841.46s)]
*  Right. We're praying for you, Rachel, and your whole family. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qY6UjHeRf8&t=844.46s)]
