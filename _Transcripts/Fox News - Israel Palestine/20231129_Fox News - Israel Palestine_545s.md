# Netanyahu: Israel will fight Hamas 'to the end'
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI)
*  Nate Foy, you are just in northern Israel, not far from Lebanon, and we've seen some [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=0.0s)]
*  activity in recent weeks from there. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=5.26s)]
*  What's happening? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Well, Harris, I can tell you that that mother that you just heard from is not alone. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=8.6s)]
*  140, actually over 140 hostages remain in Gaza. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=14.76s)]
*  And Israel reportedly has a list of 12 hostages that are set to be freed in a sixth consecutive [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=19.52s)]
*  exchange tonight. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=25.64s)]
*  We are waiting on those hostages to be transferred over to the Red Cross. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=26.8s)]
*  But reportedly in this list, it includes 10 Israeli women as well as two women who hold [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=31.080000000000002s)]
*  dual citizenship in Israel and Russia. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=37.32s)]
*  This is believed to be a gesture by Hamas to Russian President Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  It remains to be seen if any Americans are included in this newest batch of hostages [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=44.36s)]
*  that are set to be freed. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=48.980000000000004s)]
*  But it comes after a fifth exchange last night. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=50.2s)]
*  Take a look at this video. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=53.68s)]
*  This group included nine Israeli women as old as 84 and one Israeli girl, a 17-year-old [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=55.36s)]
*  who was released in exchange for 30 Hamas prisoners. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=62.24s)]
*  Two foreign workers were also released from Gaza. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=65.92s)]
*  A doctor at the Sheba Medical Center said some of the hostages had injuries, but they [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=69.0s)]
*  were all in stable condition. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=73.44s)]
*  We have new video of an Israeli Russian man reuniting with his family. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=75.5s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=79.16s)]
*  Hamas is mainly releasing women and children, but this was also considered another gesture [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=80.16s)]
*  to Putin. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=86.11999999999999s)]
*  Meanwhile, two more U.S. military flights are set to land in Egypt this week for a total [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=87.11999999999999s)]
*  of three flights carrying humanitarian aid bound for Gaza. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=92.12s)]
*  U.S. officials are again in Qatar today working to extend the temporary ceasefire to secure [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=96.4s)]
*  the release of more hostages and the delivery of more aid into Gaza. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=101.53999999999999s)]
*  But as negotiations play out, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu applied more pressure [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=105.88s)]
*  on Hamas with this message moments ago. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=111.28s)]
*  There is no way we are not going back to fighting until the end. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=116.16s)]
*  This is my policy. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=119.84s)]
*  The entire cabinet stands behind it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=121.28s)]
*  The entire government stands behind it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  The soldiers stand behind it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=126.28s)]
*  The people stand behind it. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=128.32s)]
*  This is exactly what we will do. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=130.48s)]
*  Harris, tonight an Israeli official says the only way that Israel will agree to a longer [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=134.39999999999998s)]
*  pause in the fighting is if all women and children are released from Gaza. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=139.23999999999998s)]
*  We'll see if that's a negotiating position or if that in fact holds true. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=143.72s)]
*  Negotiations are also including talks about possibly releasing Israeli men, even IDF soldiers. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=148.85999999999999s)]
*  So far Israel has had to release three Palestinian prisoners for every Israeli woman or child [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=154.66s)]
*  hostage. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=161.18s)]
*  We'll send it back to you, Harris. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=162.18s)]
*  Well, I had mentioned where you are and I don't know how close you are to the border [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=163.4s)]
*  with Lebanon. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=167.64s)]
*  But there was a point early in the war where there was a lot of concern about the rockets [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=168.92s)]
*  that were coming over into northern Israel. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=173.72s)]
*  Is that still a problem? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=176.92s)]
*  Well, Harris, yesterday Lebanese media reported that an Israeli shell landed in southern Lebanon. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=179.04s)]
*  We didn't see any further escalation. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=186.35999999999999s)]
*  The IDF wouldn't comment on it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=188.88s)]
*  They didn't confirm that that in fact happened. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=191.08s)]
*  But the IDF chief of staff did visit northern Israel yesterday. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=194.0s)]
*  And where we are, Harris, we're very close to the border. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=198.24s)]
*  This village has been evacuated. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=201.28s)]
*  The IDF chief said that when people come back to this village and others like it, they will [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=203.64000000000001s)]
*  have a much improved security situation compared to what they had on October 7th. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=208.52s)]
*  Yeah, you're talking about securing an area that potentially could become a second front [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=214.28s)]
*  of the war and all that they're doing to keep that from happening. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=218.94s)]
*  And it has quieted it at least a little bit. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=221.9s)]
*  Nate Foy, great reporting as always. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=224.85999999999999s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=226.57999999999998s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel Darren Gobb now Army veteran and Black Hawk helicopter pilot, also co-founder [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=228.02s)]
*  and executive director of Restore Liberty. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=233.16s)]
*  Great to have you and all of your expertise every time we can get you. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  You know, Colonel, as you hear about these hostage releases, the one thing that pops [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=240.5s)]
*  to my mind from Nate's reporting outside of the good news of the people who are being [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=245.1s)]
*  released are the two gestures that Hamas has made to Putin of Russia with two of the hostages [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=250.1s)]
*  released, one who's a man and I guess holding dual citizenship with Russia. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=258.02s)]
*  What is the point of that with terrorists? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=264.02s)]
*  Yeah, Harris, thank you. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=267.54s)]
*  And it's always good to join you. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=270.86s)]
*  Every time I see something happen around Israel with either Hamas or even Hezbollah and Houthi [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=273.02s)]
*  rebels and if you were to tug on that thread a little bit, you're going to find that thread [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=278.09999999999997s)]
*  running through Tehran and ultimately back in some way to Moscow. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=281.58s)]
*  So this is really kind of an acknowledgement of the fact that Putin and Moscow working [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=284.96s)]
*  with Tehran and other allies are all involved in this. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=291.02s)]
*  And this is just an acknowledgement of that fact and I think many of us know, but it's [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=295.24s)]
*  a change of it. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=299.06s)]
*  It changes a little bit when you see that acknowledgement through their actions. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=300.22s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we know that the hostages were taken as human shields and now pawns in politics [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=304.02s)]
*  that perhaps we're not focused on with regard to Russia. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=311.5s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=316.02s)]
*  And I think that's one of the risks with this conflict in general is we're so focused on [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=317.54s)]
*  Israel that we forget that there are still things going on in Ukraine and there are these [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=323.06s)]
*  ties that are across in this geopolitical spectrum between Russia, Iran, Russia and [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=328.70000000000005s)]
*  China and many other things that we still have to keep our eye on in the U.S. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=333.90000000000003s)]
*  And we can't forget that in the midst of all this. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=337.78000000000003s)]
*  But like you said, too, we also need to make sure that we do celebrate the reunion of these [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=340.42s)]
*  families at the same time. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=345.02000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, this has been hard, though, because there's so much propaganda around all of all [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=346.46000000000004s)]
*  of this. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=351.02000000000004s)]
*  I mean, the delays early on, delay, delay, delay. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=351.62s)]
*  Well, OK, I guess we'll give this list. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=354.5s)]
*  We'll give that list. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=356.34000000000003s)]
*  I mean, there was a time when Jews were being put on lists during the Holocaust. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=357.74s)]
*  And when I hear those words, who's on the list? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=361.82s)]
*  It always shakes my soul. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=364.58s)]
*  I know this is for a good purpose. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=366.46s)]
*  But the fact that we're waiting for a list to come out is also disturbing. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=369.26s)]
*  Hamas, they seem to be professional at this. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=374.82s)]
*  Well, they are professional at this and they've been at this for many decades. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=378.9s)]
*  In fact, one of their guiding principles is that war is deceit. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=381.62s)]
*  So any time that they're doing something, including treaties, hostages, exchanges and [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=386.18s)]
*  things like that, they're doing it for their own strategic advantage. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=391.78s)]
*  They're not ever going to do it for humanitarian purposes or actual care for the people [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=395.09999999999997s)]
*  that they live among. So that is something we have to account for. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=400.38s)]
*  We may not like it, but it's a fact of life when you're part of an organization that is [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=403.86s)]
*  a terrorist group that is raised this way. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=408.46s)]
*  I want to talk with you about something that popped. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=410.3s)]
*  The City Council of Oakland, California voted unanimously on a resolution for a permanent [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=412.62s)]
*  ceasefire in Gaza while also rejecting a proposal to formally condemn Hamas terrorists. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=417.7s)]
*  The event attracted dueling rallies, no violence, thankfully. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=424.3s)]
*  Inside the meeting, one speaker compared Israel to a wife beater who complains when the [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=428.58s)]
*  wife fights back. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=434.62s)]
*  Others described Israel as genocidal, colonial. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=436.22s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=440.1s)]
*  Condemning Hamas without condemning the apartheid state of Israel is basically encouraging [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=441.98s)]
*  genocide. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=450.34000000000003s)]
*  We could have easily put forth a resolution condemning the countless, countless crimes [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=451.5s)]
*  committed by the Zionist entity. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=456.62s)]
*  Your reaction? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=459.62s)]
*  Well, first of all, my reaction is I think Oakland has plenty of problems they need to [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=462.66s)]
*  address within their own city. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=466.26s)]
*  And this is not a concern of theirs ultimately, along with those other cities that are doing [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=467.90000000000003s)]
*  this. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=472.38000000000005s)]
*  Fortunately, these resolutions have absolutely no merit when it comes to dictating any actions [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=472.86s)]
*  by Israel in the first place. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=477.18s)]
*  So Israel needs to keep fighting along the public relations war, but they need to win [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=478.94s)]
*  the bigger war first, which is the eradication of Hamas. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=484.02000000000004s)]
*  That's the only ceasefire they should accept is when they should stop fighting when Hamas [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=487.02000000000004s)]
*  has been eliminated. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=492.06s)]
*  And they need to stay focused on that. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=492.94000000000005s)]
*  These kinds of resolutions in cities around the U.S. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=495.46s)]
*  are truly exposing the radicalization of the left wing and others, not only in campuses, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=498.06s)]
*  but now we're seeing them in city councils and county governments around the United [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=505.09999999999997s)]
*  States. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=509.65999999999997s)]
*  And that's unfortunate to see. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=510.06s)]
*  We shouldn't be restricting their speech in any way, shape or form. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=512.42s)]
*  But I don't see this as being any way productive towards Israel or even those who would be [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=515.38s)]
*  suffering under during this attack on Gaza that Israel has the right to conduct in the [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=521.06s)]
*  first place. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=525.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=525.9399999999999s)]
*  And you have fought for this country and fought for that right for free speech. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=526.22s)]
*  And at the same time, I continue to ask, they talk so much about hating Israel. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=529.66s)]
*  They don't talk about loving the people that they say they want to help the Palestinians. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=535.1s)]
*  And I don't understand how any of what they're doing is helping them. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=539.8199999999999s)]
*  Colonel, thank you very much. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSKOWZmo8YI&t=543.42s)]
