# Israel reportedly targets Gaza with 'bunker buster' bombs to destroy tunnel networks
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ)
*  Breaking right now, smoke rising above the Gaza skyline as Israel expands its ground [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=0.0s)]
*  offensive against Hamas militants. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=5.48s)]
*  And as IDF forces enter the second phase of the war, one of the biggest challenges for [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  troops is the very elaborate Hamas tunnel system built underneath the already challenging [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=11.24s)]
*  urban battlefield. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=16.34s)]
*  Ohio congressional candidate Chris Banweg is a Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel who [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=17.76s)]
*  served in the Middle East and he joins us now. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=23.28s)]
*  Good morning to you. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  Israel has elite forces, incredible technology, but there are those who say that this tunnel [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=27.24s)]
*  system will neutralize all that. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  So how do IDF forces navigate this situation? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  Well, first off, thanks for having me on. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=37.12s)]
*  But I think it's fair to say that the challenges ahead for the Israeli defense forces cannot [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=41.0s)]
*  be overstated. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  In my experience with Central Command and working with the IDF, I can appreciate just [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=48.72s)]
*  how incredibly challenging this battlefield will be. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=52.76s)]
*  Once you get through the Gaza area and into this, it's like a second city underground [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=57.080000000000005s)]
*  with all the challenges of an urban conflict area, but amplified. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=62.6s)]
*  You think about small spaces and unknown pathways and the fact that as a baseline, there is [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=67.76s)]
*  no natural light. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=73.98s)]
*  And if you can recall the last time you tried to navigate your own house in the middle of [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=76.12s)]
*  the night without turning on the lights, you can start to imagine where their day begins [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=80.6s)]
*  when we start to talk about tunnel warfare and the underground areas that Hamas has. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=86.88s)]
*  Now, we also have to consider that Hamas chose this battle and they have already shown their [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=92.56s)]
*  barbarism. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=98.08s)]
*  So when we think about the amount of time and ability they've had to prepare it, there's [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=99.39999999999999s)]
*  no limit to the number of traps and ambushes that they can put in place for the IDF. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=103.8s)]
*  And they have shown their intent to injure the Israelis, to hurt them as best they can. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=110.44s)]
*  There are reports that bunker buster bombs are being used. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=116.24s)]
*  Seems like it makes sense. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=120.36s)]
*  You want to bust the bunker, so you use a bomb. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=121.36s)]
*  But it seems like there could be ancillary issues with regard to casualties of your own [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=123.4s)]
*  troops, potentially the hostages. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=128.16s)]
*  Explain how these work and why they're going to be utilized. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=129.8s)]
*  Todd, that's actually a great question. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=135.64s)]
*  In my past deployments, we've used some similar technology in Iraq earlier, in Ramadi, in [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=138.36s)]
*  Mosul. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=145.72s)]
*  You can set a delay potentially on the fuse of some of these explosives so that they will [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=146.72s)]
*  go to the depth they need to end at. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=151.52s)]
*  When we think about the math and the science that goes into it, the technology is absolutely [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=155.72s)]
*  there for us to be careful in the way that we are applying these ordinances. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=161.8s)]
*  But it's not perfect, as you said. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=168.24s)]
*  There is risk to both anyone underground and our troops that are in the area. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel Marine Corporal Chris VanWyk, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=178.20000000000002s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_87GJ4-GrQ&t=182.4s)]
