*  and hostage release. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA32RIr40i0&t=7.4s)]
*  But Hamas is saying publicly no additional prisoners will be freed until the war is completely [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA32RIr40i0&t=9.36s)]
*  over. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA32RIr40i0&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  The Israeli military says it has confirmed a major Hamas command center in the heart [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA32RIr40i0&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  of Gaza City. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA32RIr40i0&t=19.92s)]
*  The IDF calls it a serious blow to the Islamic militant group. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA32RIr40i0&t=21.52s)]
*  Senior Foreign Affairs correspondent Greg Palcott is live tonight in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA32RIr40i0&t=25.64s)]
*  Good evening Greg. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA32RIr40i0&t=29.12s)]
*  Hi Brett, it was another day of pretty nasty combat in Gaza between Israel and Hamas with [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA32RIr40i0&t=31.080000000000002s)]
*  little sign of a halt in the clashes. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA32RIr40i0&t=39.36s)]
*  Israeli forces on a mission in Gaza, hitting Hamas targets before they're forced to scale [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA32RIr40i0&t=44.64s)]
*  back or take a break. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA32RIr40i0&t=49.620000000000005s)]
*  You can see inside here, deep down, a tunnel which was built for the last few months. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA32RIr40i0&t=51.0s)]
*  Uncovering another Hamas tunnel, this one in Gaza City, 70 feet deep with elevators, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA32RIr40i0&t=57.64s)]
*  staircases, plumbing, electricity, then blowing it up. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA32RIr40i0&t=62.68s)]
*  What I suggest for Hamas is very simple, surrender or die. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA32RIr40i0&t=67.36s)]
*  They have no other choice. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA32RIr40i0&t=71.68s)]
*  Hamas down, but still not out. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA32RIr40i0&t=73.28s)]
*  Launching more rockets aimed at central Israel, including Tel Aviv. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA32RIr40i0&t=77.64s)]
*  The U.S. repeating its call to reduce fighting. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA32RIr40i0&t=80.6s)]
*  We believe that a transition in the near future is the best possible outcome. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA32RIr40i0&t=84.62s)]
*  Humanitarian situation in Gaza dire, casualties soaring, none of the hospitals in the north [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA32RIr40i0&t=92.62s)]
*  are functioning and all are hungry. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA32RIr40i0&t=96.86s)]
*  Pretty much everybody in Gaza is hungry. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA32RIr40i0&t=99.94s)]
*  About more than 500,000, half a million people are starving. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA32RIr40i0&t=103.30000000000001s)]
*  Hamas hasha talks appear stuck. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA32RIr40i0&t=110.94s)]
*  Hamas rejecting Israel's demand for a release of captives during a one-week pause. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA32RIr40i0&t=112.9s)]
*  It wants a longer break, even before the talking. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA32RIr40i0&t=117.18s)]
*  The focus now is to stop this aggression, especially since our enemy now knows that [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA32RIr40i0&t=121.26s)]
*  it cannot achieve any of its goals. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA32RIr40i0&t=124.58s)]
*  As the families of the kidnapped wait, including the sister of Alexander Lobanov, snatched [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA32RIr40i0&t=126.58s)]
*  by Hamas at that music festival October 7th. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA32RIr40i0&t=131.14s)]
*  Alex is a lot of friends that love him. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA32RIr40i0&t=134.26000000000002s)]
*  Alex, our two-year-old son, that every day keep asking where is daddy. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA32RIr40i0&t=136.58s)]
*  And the only answer we have that daddy is loving. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA32RIr40i0&t=143.70000000000002s)]
*  And still being considered at the UN Security Council this night a resolution that will [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA32RIr40i0&t=150.98000000000002s)]
*  call for a humanitarian ceasefire and a greater amount of aid getting into Gaza. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA32RIr40i0&t=156.06s)]
*  That is reportedly being held up by the United States as it wants closer inspection of that [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA32RIr40i0&t=162.9s)]
*  aid before it gets into the war zone. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA32RIr40i0&t=168.3s)]
*  As lives hang in the balance, Brett. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA32RIr40i0&t=171.86s)]
