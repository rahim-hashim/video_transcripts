# Israel-Hamas conflict is only a ‘proxy war’ for Iran: Counter-terrorism expert
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8)
*  Let's bring in U.S. Army Special Forces veteran and counterterrorism expert Mike Glover. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=0.0s)]
*  Mike, Carly asked Trey the question. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=4.44s)]
*  I'm going to ask you the exact same thing. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=6.4s)]
*  Your reaction to this delay, is this a minor hiccup or is the deal in serious jeopardy? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=7.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's very uncertain when you're dealing with terrorist organizations and negotiating. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=13.6s)]
*  I mean, this being done by Qatar is another part of the complexity. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=19.72s)]
*  When I see this whole thing happening, I'm very thankful that, you know, in this case, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  20 women and 30 children are potentially going to be released, but at a one to three ratio [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=29.32s)]
*  to Palestinians. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=33.84s)]
*  Now, these Palestinians aren't Hamas terrorists mainly, but there's definitely going to be [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=34.84s)]
*  some fragility in this entire process, the entire time through, day to day. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=41.2s)]
*  Remember, we're partitioning the hostages by the day. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=45.6s)]
*  They're not getting released at once. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=49.32s)]
*  And this is happening over a four-day period, as long as everybody sticks to the plan. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=51.16s)]
*  Yeah, as long as everyone sticks to the plan. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=55.92s)]
*  Right now, things are so tenuous, and that is, I'm sure, concerning the families. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=58.0s)]
*  They want to see their loved ones home as quickly as possible. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=63.32s)]
*  And if these 50 hostages do come home, they will have a story to tell. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=66.56s)]
*  They will be able to provide, I guess, some level of intelligence. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=71.16s)]
*  How important, Mike, are those eyewitness accounts? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  Oh, they're the utmost importance. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=76.84s)]
*  The first thing that's going to happen is they're going to be checked medically and [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=80.12s)]
*  likely simultaneously be questioned about the details of where they were held and all [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=83.88000000000001s)]
*  of the intelligence, all the information, because that's going to be utilized to obviously [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=90.04s)]
*  lend itself to operations. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=95.64s)]
*  Both on the Hamas side and the Israeli side, they have literally and clearly defined that [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=97.72s)]
*  this doesn't mean a stop to the war. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=103.12s)]
*  This is just only the beginning. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=105.16s)]
*  And if we get through this, it's good. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=107.08000000000001s)]
*  But let's not hedge our bets on it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=110.36s)]
*  This is Haas' rescue. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=112.4s)]
*  This is Haas' negotiation with terrorists. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=114.28s)]
*  Does your gut instinct tell you the hostages will be released tomorrow, or do you fear [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=117.80000000000001s)]
*  another delay, Mike? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=122.08000000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of incentives for Hamas. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=125.4s)]
*  In this case, where they're looking at a ceasefire, where they're not allowed to fly drones over [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=127.44000000000001s)]
*  a certain period of time, certainly Israel will have other assets above head to watch [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=132.32s)]
*  what's going on on the ground. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=137.04000000000002s)]
*  But it's actually in Israel's best interest to facilitate this and allow this to happen, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=138.48s)]
*  because they lose nothing. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=143.92s)]
*  I mean, these guys are boxed in, whether on top or underground in the tunnel systems. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=144.92s)]
*  So I'm optimistic, and I hope, especially on this day on Thanksgiving here in the U.S., [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=150.29999999999998s)]
*  leading into tomorrow, that this is something that takes place and something that happens [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=157.39999999999998s)]
*  for these families. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=160.89999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, Mike, there's also this. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=161.89999999999998s)]
*  Last week, Reuters reported that Iran met with members of Hamas and expressed outrage [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=163.29999999999998s)]
*  that they weren't forewarned about this attack in Israel. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=167.82000000000002s)]
*  And they said, well, help—we will still help you politically, but we're not going [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=172.42000000000002s)]
*  to go into Israel and help fight this war for you. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=175.54000000000002s)]
*  There are so many ways that you can interpret that, because obviously you can't believe [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=179.48000000000002s)]
*  anything Iran says. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=183.06s)]
*  But how do you parse through that news? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=184.5s)]
*  Well, here's what I know personally. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=188.5s)]
*  Spending time in Yemen with the Central Intelligence Agency and spending time, obviously, abroad [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=191.94s)]
*  in that area with the U.S. Army, look, this is a proxy war for them, whether it's the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=196.38s)]
*  Houthis, Hezbollah or Hamas. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=204.1s)]
*  They don't need to get intimately involved. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=206.82s)]
*  They don't want their lifestyle. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=208.46s)]
*  Look, I think the Iranian people and the people of Persia are amazing human beings. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=209.46s)]
*  There's a lot of good people from Iran. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=215.34s)]
*  I actually know people from Iran. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=217.06s)]
*  It's their government system, and they don't want that to break down. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=219.26s)]
*  They certainly don't want a war with the U.S. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=223.38s)]
*  If they could use it like they used against American service members in Iraq when they [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=226.38s)]
*  were bombing us and using advanced technology to integrate and kill American soldiers, they [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=230.12s)]
*  don't need to get intimately involved. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=236.26s)]
*  They did that in Sadr City with Mokhtar al-Sadr. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  And I think, personally, this will not lead into a war with Iran, but that's still—when [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=240.98s)]
*  you have their action arms and Hezbollah, Hamas and the Houthis, we just did counteroffensive [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=249.62s)]
*  operations last night and yesterday. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=255.14000000000001s)]
*  So this is something that's ongoing, and they don't have to have their hands in it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=258.7s)]
*  Well, I guess if there's any sort of silver lining, it would be that you're saying Iran [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=262.98s)]
*  won't get directly involved. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=266.54s)]
*  Iran conflict, but there you have it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=267.86s)]
*  Iran's still allowing its proxies to do their dirty work. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=270.22s)]
*  Mike Leber, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=273.22s)]
*  Great insight. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=274.86s)]
*  Happy Thanksgiving. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFXRaaV4D8&t=275.86s)]
