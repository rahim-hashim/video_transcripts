# Poll shows young Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of Israel's attacks on Hamas
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c)
*  Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=0.0s)]
*  Occupation no more! [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=3.08s)]
*  We'll be free from all sides! [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=5.72s)]
*  Same on you! Same on you! [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  One, two, three, four! [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=9.88s)]
*  One, two, three, four! [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=11.48s)]
*  Occupation no more! [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=13.48s)]
*  Occupation no more! [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=15.48s)]
*  So that's just a sample of what was happening outside the White House over the weekend. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=17.48s)]
*  Pro-Palestinian rallies spilling over from the college campus to the White House, and they were vocal. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=20.76s)]
*  My next guest escaped Iran as a child with her mom, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=26.0s)]
*  and she says most of the protesters are passionate, and they are brainwashed, uneducated, and misguided. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=29.08s)]
*  Dr. Sheila Nazarian joins me live now from California in Beverly Hills, and Dr. good morning to you. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=35.48s)]
*  Go ahead, I tell you what, before we get there. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=40.64s)]
*  This is what Quinnipiac shows about those broken down by a demographic. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=43.4s)]
*  If you are 65 or older, you approve of Israel's response by at least 59%. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=50.04s)]
*  If you are between the ages of 18 and 34, you only approve of it by 32%. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=58.04s)]
*  That number is cut in half. Can you explain why? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=63.88s)]
*  Well, I think the reason for what we're seeing in this disparity of ages and the young people, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=68.24s)]
*  actually in some cases supporting Hamas, is a failure on our part to educate them on social media and in the classrooms. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=73.32s)]
*  I think for far too long, we've been playing a very short game, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=82.72s)]
*  while pro-Hamas, pro-Islamist lobbying groups have been playing the long game by funding the Middle Eastern studies programs. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=85.67999999999999s)]
*  I just saw Cornell was given $1.4 billion by Qatar. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=96.16s)]
*  So naturally, we're seeing this age gap based off of what is being taught in the classrooms [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=101.52s)]
*  and what is being seen on social media, specifically TikTok. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=108.88s)]
*  Okay, so you got a lot of celebs out there too, and I know you got strong feelings about them. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=112.08s)]
*  Alicia Wiesel, the son of Elie Wiesel, was with us earlier today, about 9 o'clock this morning. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=116.48s)]
*  Here's how he frames social media, the young people of America, and the world on this. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=122.56s)]
*  To go through life and simply take what you see in a TikTok video or Instagram and say, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=131.28s)]
*  Oh my God, people are suffering. Israel has dropped bombs. Therefore, Israel must be evil, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=136.48s)]
*  is such intellectual shorthand that students deserve better. They deserve better from their teachers. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=141.67999999999998s)]
*  They deserve better from themselves and their parents. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  And we're encouraging critical thinking here to occur in university campuses. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=149.83999999999997s)]
*  Here's the problem, is that TikTok sells, Instagram sells. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=154.88s)]
*  You look at the incredible popularity of these social media sites. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  It's hard to counter. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=163.68s)]
*  And it's increasingly difficult to counter with billions of Muslims in the world and only 15 [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=166.48000000000002s)]
*  million Jews in the whole world. You know, they have bots. I know from the conflict two years ago, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=172.72s)]
*  most of the messages and comments that were pro-Palestine on Instagram were traced back to two [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=180.16s)]
*  IP addresses in Malaysia. So we're really playing this PR war that by numbers is daunting, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=186.8s)]
*  but that doesn't mean that we stop and that doesn't mean that we stop fighting for the truth [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=194.96s)]
*  and that we promote and hold accountable truth in universities and hold teachers accountable. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=199.28s)]
*  For example, the teacher at one of the Ivy League schools that said that Hamas's attack was [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=206.72000000000003s)]
*  exhilarating, hearing from the majority of the Ivy League school presidents, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=211.68s)]
*  not being able to say what Hamas did was wrong. How easy is that? And they're not even able to [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=216.56s)]
*  verbalize that. It has been such a wake-up call for Jews and patriots all over America. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=221.68s)]
*  I bet. I don't know if you saw over the weekend, but that red paint that was put on the gates of [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  the White House, I think it is still there as of this hour. Now, when this happened in New York [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=234.08s)]
*  during the George Floyd protests, they put all that red paint over the George Washington arch [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=241.84s)]
*  in Greenwich Village. Well, the NYPD was out there within 12 hours and sandblasted that stuff off. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=247.36s)]
*  I mean, we'll get a check in the White House and see whether or not that's removed. Final point. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=254.0s)]
*  You started three years ago with your activism and you believe today based on what you're seeing on [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  campuses among young people, among celebrities, that the mask has come off. At about 15 seconds [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=263.12s)]
*  to address that. Go ahead. Yeah, I think it's been a shock, especially for progressive Jews in America, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=268.56s)]
*  to see that the Black Lives Matter that they marched with and the women's marches that in [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=276.56s)]
*  their roots had anti-Semitism from the beginning, that they sort of slid under the rug. I think it's [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=282.24s)]
*  been a huge wake-up call, especially for them to see that these groups don't stand with them and [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=288.08s)]
*  have completely abandoned the Jewish cause. We'll see how and who answers the alarm. Dr, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=292.88s)]
*  thanks for coming on. Sheila Nazarian out of California. Thanks. Thank you. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2J0Q3FfH5c&t=297.92s)]
