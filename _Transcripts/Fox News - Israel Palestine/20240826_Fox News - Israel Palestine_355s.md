# Hezbollah launches hundreds of rockets into Israel over 'preemptive' strikes in Lebanon
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [August 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8)
*  Now to a Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=0.0s)]
*  The U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman is in Israel right now as the U.S. works to avoid [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=1.96s)]
*  further escalation in the Middle East after an Israeli naval soldier was killed in rocket [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  fire with Hezbollah, firing the IDF's preemptive strikes in Lebanon. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  Trey Hingst is live in Tel Aviv with the latest. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=16.36s)]
*  Trey? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=19.32s)]
*  Yeah, hey, Griff, Ashley. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=20.32s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=22.72s)]
*  After Israel launched preemptive strikes against Hezbollah over the weekend, the region now [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=23.72s)]
*  waits to see what comes next. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=28.52s)]
*  The Iran-backed group is claiming victory in Sunday's exchange of fire, saying that [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=30.88s)]
*  there is evidence they targeted only military positions and fired close to Tel Aviv. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=36.28s)]
*  The reality is that two-thirds of the rockets and missiles they had prepared to launch were [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=41.78s)]
*  destroyed by the Israeli military. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=46.08s)]
*  Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah warned of further attacks in the future when he addressed [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=48.28s)]
*  Lebanon from an undisclosed puncture. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=52.6s)]
*  As the region surveys the aftermath of the events over the weekend, Joint Chiefs Chairman [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=55.42s)]
*  C.Q. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=59.82s)]
*  Brown is in Israel today for meetings. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=60.82s)]
*  He will speak privately with Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Galant, I'm told. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=62.260000000000005s)]
*  The top U.S. general's visit comes with American assets spread throughout the region to deter [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=66.3s)]
*  Iran and its proxies from further attacks. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=70.84s)]
*  With ceasefire talks ongoing in Cairo, once again at the working level, U.S. officials [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=73.56s)]
*  remain hopeful that a deal to end the war in Gaza could de-escalate regional tension. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=77.94s)]
*  The talks over the weekend were described as constructive, but they were also immediately [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=83.1s)]
*  rejected by Hamas, who says the terms have changed. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=86.91999999999999s)]
*  Now 325 days into the war, we do know 100 Israeli hostages still remain inside Gaza, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=90.69999999999999s)]
*  and as the war continues, there are concerns that if a situation is not calmed there in [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=98.02s)]
*  Gaza, there could be larger regional escalation. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=103.38s)]
*  Griff, Ashley? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=106.5s)]
*  Trey Yanks, live for us in Tel Aviv. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=108.74s)]
*  Trey, thank you. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=110.66s)]
*  Let's now bring in Daniel Flesch, a former senior adviser for Israel's UN mission and [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=112.22s)]
*  former IDF paratrooper. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=117.25999999999999s)]
*  Daniel, thank you for getting up early and starting off our Monday morning here. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=119.22s)]
*  What do you make of where things stand and the fears of a wider escalation? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=122.96s)]
*  Well, thank you. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=127.94s)]
*  Good morning to you both. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=129.7s)]
*  It should be clear to everyone watching that we are currently in the midst of a broader [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=130.7s)]
*  regional war and escalation since October. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=134.74s)]
*  October 7th, Hamas attacked Israel. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=137.66s)]
*  October 8th, Hezbollah joined in that fight, unprovoked from Israel. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=139.66s)]
*  And Israel's been fighting for the past 10-plus months on seven different fronts, all fronts [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=143.1s)]
*  that are supported by Iran. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=148.18s)]
*  So to believe that this could lead to a broader escalation, there is already an escalation [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=150.1s)]
*  going on. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=154.06s)]
*  And we have to remember that, particularly in the north, 80,000 Israelis are currently [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=155.06s)]
*  internally displaced from their homes in the north. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=160.38s)]
*  So anything that Israel does vis-a-vis Hezbollah is to try to restore deterrence and security [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=162.54000000000002s)]
*  to that northern border. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=167.24s)]
*  This could be one step, but it certainly would not be the last step. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  You know, I want to bring it back, Daniel, to what you said a few weeks ago, August 5th, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=171.4s)]
*  to be exact. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=174.76000000000002s)]
*  You said the Biden administration's anti-Israel deterrence has undermined our ally and emboldened [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=175.76000000000002s)]
*  our enemies, which in the Middle East is a recipe for war. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=180.92000000000002s)]
*  I want to play this soundbite for you of Biden more or less ignoring reporters' questions [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=184.4s)]
*  on the situation. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=190.16000000000003s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=191.16000000000003s)]
*  Mr. President, are you concerned about a widening war? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=192.16000000000003s)]
*  Mr. President, are you concerned about a widening war? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  How are the attacks affecting ceasefire talks? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=203.07999999999998s)]
*  Mr. President, what's the latest with this ceasefire talk? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=207.07999999999998s)]
*  Mr. President, are you concerned about escalation in the Middle East? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=217.07999999999998s)]
*  You know, Daniel, that's not a good look. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=222.0s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=224.0s)]
*  Well, it's very clear that this administration, the Biden-Harris administration, since October [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=225.0s)]
*  and really before has pursued a policy of de-escalation in the Middle East, largely [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=229.68s)]
*  I believe because it's coming up on a campaign year, but also in effect that's been a strategy [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=234.0s)]
*  of deterrence against Israel. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=238.60000000000002s)]
*  You know, in October the administration, the president went to the region to deliver a [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=239.88000000000002s)]
*  bear hug effectively to Israel. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=244.24s)]
*  They said to Israel, every step of the way, slow down, stop or don't, whether it's going [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=246.16000000000003s)]
*  to Hanunis, fighting during Ramadan, going to Ra'afah in the south or now engaging with [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=250.56s)]
*  Hezbollah. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=255.56s)]
*  And we have to realize again, there is a regional war going on. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=256.56s)]
*  And the reason there's a regional war is because of Iran. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=259.8s)]
*  It's Iranian proxies that are attacking Israel in Lebanon, in Gaza, from Judea and Samaria, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=262.32s)]
*  the West Bank, from Iraq, from Syria, from Yemen and obviously Iran itself. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=266.8s)]
*  So to believe that any response from Israel would lead to broader escalation, again, the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=271.8s)]
*  framing has to be that we are currently seeing a wider regional war and America's allies [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=276.04s)]
*  and enemies see our response, whether we're withholding our ally Israel from engaging [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=282.44s)]
*  in this existential fight and giving succor to our enemies, Iran and others, enabling [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=286.68s)]
*  them to take the initiative and again, keep 80,000 Israelis displaced from their homes [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=291.6s)]
*  in the north. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=295.64000000000004s)]
*  So, so final question, Daniel, we've got two carrier strike groups, the Lincoln and Teddy [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=296.64000000000004s)]
*  Roosevelt in the Middle East. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=302.36s)]
*  We couldn't have a stronger posture. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=304.24s)]
*  I don't think is Iran getting the message, which is stay out of this. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=306.76s)]
*  Well, it's certainly not a question of capabilities on the part of the United States, even without [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=310.08s)]
*  that force posture demonstrated throughout the region, both in the Mediterranean as well [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=314.84000000000003s)]
*  as the Persian Gulf, but it's a question of will. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=318.36s)]
*  If there's is, is there the political and military will to actively engage Israel's [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=320.72s)]
*  and America's enemies? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=325.40000000000003s)]
*  And I believe our enemies don't think there is the will. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=326.88s)]
*  Otherwise, we would have seen the Biden-Harris administration take much more proactive steps [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=329.08000000000004s)]
*  months ago or even letting Israel engage in the manner it needs to. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=333.72s)]
*  Daniel Flesch, former advisor to Israel's UN mission. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=338.36s)]
*  Thank you very much for taking time and for your insight. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=341.36s)]
*  Thanks, Dan. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGlJ2yJ-N8&t=343.56s)]
