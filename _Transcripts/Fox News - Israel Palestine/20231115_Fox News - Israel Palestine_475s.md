# Jack Keane: Hamas did not count on this
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4)
*  The hospital controversy is exposing a double standard when it comes to reporting on Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=0.0s)]
*  You see how detailed Alex and Mike Tobin and also Trey Yngst have been on what they can [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=5.76s)]
*  get in the field and bringing forth transparency and truth in a war zone. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=11.32s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal editorial board points this out and here's what it writes, in 2016 [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=17.7s)]
*  U.S. sitcom released a statement, coalition strikes Mosul hospital. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=23.36s)]
*  The Islamic State, it explained, was using the hospital as a base of operations. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=28.76s)]
*  Accordingly, the U.S.-led coalition conducted precision strikes. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=33.52s)]
*  The story, or rather the scandal, wasn't that the U.S. struck the terrorists where they [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=38.52s)]
*  hid. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=44.2s)]
*  No, the way it got reported was that terrorists had used the hospital for cover and the first [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=45.2s)]
*  place didn't come out. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  What did? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=51.96s)]
*  In Gaza, Hamas terrorists used the same war crime tactics. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=52.96s)]
*  Only now observers are rushing to apologize for it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=57.56s)]
*  In Focus, retired U.S. Army General Jack Keene, Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst and Chair [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  of the Institute for the Study of War. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=69.8s)]
*  General, thank you for being with me. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=71.72s)]
*  Look, battlefields are difficult enough without being misreported, misrepresented on what's [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=73.56s)]
*  going on on the ground. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=78.30000000000001s)]
*  And all of this, I would imagine, puts a lot of pressure on Israel. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  the PR is part of the problem. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=84.42s)]
*  Oh, certainly they do. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=87.26s)]
*  I mean, they know full well that Hamas's barbaric attack on October the 7th was intended to [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=89.9s)]
*  get a violent response back from the Israelis and get widespread international condemnation [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=97.54s)]
*  and also an isolation of Israel geopolitically. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=104.8s)]
*  Certainly the condemnation has happened, the isolation to some degree, but not to a [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=109.62s)]
*  large degree. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=114.26s)]
*  So, yes, this has always been an information war from the outset. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=115.26s)]
*  Hamas has known how to exploit it for the last 16 years in doing so. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=119.98s)]
*  What they didn't count on, though, Harris, is that the Israelis have made up their mind, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=125.02000000000001s)]
*  this is it. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=130.54000000000002s)]
*  We're going to dismantle Hamas once and for all. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=131.54000000000002s)]
*  Hamas knew that Israel would come into Gaza and conduct attacks, but they didn't count [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=135.34s)]
*  on the fact that they have a singular aim, and that is to destroy the effectiveness of [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=140.7s)]
*  this organization. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=146.66s)]
*  And based on everything I see so far, they do not intend to stop until they've accomplished [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=148.5s)]
*  that objective. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=154.14s)]
*  And the reason is, if they fall short of it, Hamas will rise again, and down the road we're [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=155.14s)]
*  going to see this again. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=160.22s)]
*  And how do we know that? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=161.22s)]
*  Because they've already told us. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=162.32s)]
*  One of the leaders was on network last weekend saying just that, there would be a second, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=163.94000000000003s)]
*  a third, a fourth, and a fifth attack. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=169.78s)]
*  So yes, this is a complicated operation. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=172.18s)]
*  And certainly what is happening around El Shifa Hospital, with five buildings in that [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=174.86s)]
*  very large complex having tunnels underneath it and having to bring in specially trained [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=179.42000000000002s)]
*  troops to deal with the reality of a tunnel complex, terrorists in it, and possibly innocent [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=186.18s)]
*  civilians also, that is a very demanding operation. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=192.9s)]
*  But the Israelis are up for this. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=196.18s)]
*  They train special units to be able to deal with something as complex as that. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=199.18s)]
*  Yeah, and I'm so glad you pointed it out, because it really is a special unit that can [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=203.74s)]
*  handle ambushes, booby traps, protecting civilians, all the like, all at once in an area that [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=208.14000000000001s)]
*  wasn't built for them. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=214.08s)]
*  It was built for the enemy. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=215.32s)]
*  The Pentagon has released videos showing retaliatory U.S. airstrikes in eastern Syria. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=217.22s)]
*  That happened on Sunday. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=223.06s)]
*  And that was the third time the U.S. hit back against Iran's proxies, those bought, paid [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=224.18s)]
*  for, trained killers that they have fighting for them against us. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=229.9s)]
*  And they've hit our troops 53 times in that region. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=234.9s)]
*  Well, it doesn't seem like the deterrence, and now it's popped up to 56. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=239.46s)]
*  It doesn't seem like the deterrence of those three times we hit them is anywhere close [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=245.02s)]
*  to working. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=249.0s)]
*  Fifty-six U.S. service members have been hurt as well. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=250.0s)]
*  One American contractor killed. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=253.9s)]
*  And given that aggression, a lot of backlash over the Biden administration just renewing [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=256.3s)]
*  sanctions. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=261.54s)]
*  They just renewed a sanctions waiver with all of this going on. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=262.7s)]
*  And they know Iran is behind this with its proxies. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=266.78000000000003s)]
*  The move could allow Iran to access up to $10 billion from Iraq, the State Department [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=270.70000000000005s)]
*  playing some defense, as you might imagine. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=276.70000000000005s)]
*  Let's watch. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=279.22s)]
*  They get their hands on zero additional dollars as a result of these waivers. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=281.1s)]
*  Again, none of these funds are sent to Iran. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=285.22s)]
*  They are held in third-party accounts outside Iran and can be used only for humanitarian [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=287.54s)]
*  and other non-sanctionable purposes for the benefits of the Iranian people. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=293.06s)]
*  And if not back from the dead, look at this. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=297.18s)]
*  ISIS is posting videos online. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=300.26000000000005s)]
*  It's calling for attacks using suicide bombing vests on Jewish people in the U.S. and in [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=303.94000000000005s)]
*  Europe, also at Israeli embassies worldwide and U.S. bases in the Persian Gulf. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=309.18s)]
*  A short time ago, the FBI head Christopher Wray spoke directly to this during a House [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=314.58000000000004s)]
*  hearing underway right now on threats to the homeland. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=319.14000000000004s)]
*  We've seen a rogues gallery of foreign terrorist organizations call for attacks against Americans [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=324.06s)]
*  and our allies. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=330.18s)]
*  ISIS urged its followers to target Jewish communities in the United States and Europe. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=331.42s)]
*  Given those calls for action, our most immediate concern is that individuals or small groups [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=338.94s)]
*  will draw twisted inspiration from the events in the Middle East to carry out attacks here [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=344.54s)]
*  at home. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=350.82s)]
*  Now, General, you know the first time somebody hears the word ISIS again in this way. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=351.82s)]
*  The question is, oh, we thought we'd taken them out completely. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=356.66s)]
*  Talk to me about that and how much you think this, what this means that they are in the [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=359.98s)]
*  game now. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=364.34000000000003s)]
*  Well, you covered a lot there, but a couple of points. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=365.34000000000003s)]
*  Number one, this attack that Hamas did and the worldwide coverage that is received has [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=370.82s)]
*  really energized radical Islamic movements worldwide. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=377.18s)]
*  And suddenly, our intelligence services have got to be watching this like a hawk, particularly [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=380.74s)]
*  given the open border that we have in the United States and also for potential attacks [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=386.3s)]
*  at our U.S. bases and embassies around the world. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=391.94s)]
*  So the antenna clearly has to be up for something like this. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=394.5s)]
*  In terms of the money going to the Iranians, I mean, I'm stunned that after all this time [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=399.7s)]
*  that they would, the administration would do something like this. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=405.82s)]
*  I mean, $10 billion, any amount of money going to Iran, we just have to accept the fact, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=409.26s)]
*  regardless of what safeguards we think we have, regardless of what our well intentions [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=415.34s)]
*  are here, the reality is the money is going to be used how the Iranians see fit. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=421.21999999999997s)]
*  And their number one priority is to fund their proxies in the Middle East. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=427.5s)]
*  And it's not only irresponsible to do something like this, Harris, it's reckless to do it. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=432.67999999999995s)]
*  And that's the shame of it in terms of making a decision like that. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=439.7s)]
*  Can you imagine at this particular time when the Iranian proxies are on the march in the [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=444.06s)]
*  Middle East in full view of everybody, that we're going to help get them flush with additional [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=449.42s)]
*  money? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=455.06s)]
*  Makes no sense. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=456.42s)]
*  It's almost as though the White House would prefer we go to war because they'll just keep [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=457.98s)]
*  firing on us. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=461.14s)]
*  And we've proven that we're not going to do much if they do. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=462.21999999999997s)]
*  And now they've got extra cash. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=464.38s)]
*  I wish they defend that or at least have a fireside chat and explain it. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=467.09999999999997s)]
*  General, thank you very much. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=471.18s)]
*  It's good to have you in focus. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3uRpklUi4&t=473.34s)]
