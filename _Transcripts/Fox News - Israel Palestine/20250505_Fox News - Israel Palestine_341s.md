# Dave Portnoy EXPLODES after antisemitic sign shown in Barstool bar
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc)
*  So an upsetting show of anti-Semitism. Now, Barcell sports founder Dave Portnoy is doing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=0.0s)]
*  something about the vulgar slur displayed on a sign at his Philadelphia bar. Watch. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=16.64s)]
*  My initial reaction was like, I'm going to burn these people to the ground, their families, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=22.16s)]
*  and it's like, you know what? Maybe that's not the best course of action. Maybe I can use this [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=27.88s)]
*  as a teaching moment. I'm sending these kids to Auschwitz. They've agreed to go and they're [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=33.56s)]
*  going to do a tour of the concentration camps in Germany and hopefully learn something. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  And Dave Portnoy joins us now. Thank you so much for being on the show. Can you take us back to [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=46.96s)]
*  the moment when you first heard about it? What was your reaction was? How you felt? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=53.599999999999994s)]
*  I was furious. I got inundated with just everybody. I mean, Philadelphia is definitely [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=56.68s)]
*  a big Barstool city. We've been a lot there. So just everybody saw it, made the rounds in [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=63.92s)]
*  social media and I was, my blood was boiling. I was just absolutely incensed. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=68.68s)]
*  Okay. And so you, you went through a range of ideas for how you wanted to handle it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=73.08s)]
*  Tell us what you started with and what you ended up with. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=79.2s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, the first knee-jerk reaction was like just to punish them and kind of ruin their [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=82.24s)]
*  lives. Whoever was involved in this as much as possible and make them regret it and, you know, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=89.32s)]
*  consequences for their actions and the people at the bar make sure anybody who allowed this or was [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=94.24s)]
*  a part of it to be fired. They still were. And then when I thought about more, it's like, you know, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=99.19999999999999s)]
*  that, what is that going to do? There's just so much hate right now in the world, especially [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=105.11999999999999s)]
*  anti-Semitism. I spoke with the crafts and I know that they have a big anti-Semitism organization [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=110.24s)]
*  and try to stop hate. We kind of brainstormed and we came up with the concept of sending them [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  to Poland, to the concentration camps. They put me in touch with people who would be able to give [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=124.32s)]
*  a tour. I talked to the kids. I talked to everybody involved in this, like instantly. I was getting [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=128.64s)]
*  phone numbers, names. So I spoke with every single person involved to try to, you know, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=133.36s)]
*  basically understand what happened. How could this happen? Why did they do this? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=140.4s)]
*  And obviously at this point, they're all going to be like, I'm so sorry. I would never do this [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=144.56s)]
*  because they got caught. But the thought was maybe if they could learn more about, you know, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=148.96s)]
*  the history and why this is so offensive and visit Poland and the concentration camps in Auschwitz, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=155.28000000000003s)]
*  you could make a teaching moment out of it. So that's what we landed on. And they were willing [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=161.92s)]
*  to go do this. When you talk to the crafts, and I just wonder about anti-Semitism being like the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=165.83999999999997s)]
*  oldest hatred. And do you think that there is just some ignorance and that perhaps, you know, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=171.67999999999998s)]
*  the teachable moment is the one that can at least for these individuals make a difference? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=178.64s)]
*  Yeah, I can hope it can help. It's certainly, I think there's been a, I've been online now with [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=184.95999999999998s)]
*  Barstool for over two decades. I, without a shadow of a doubt over the last year, year and a half, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=190.4s)]
*  obviously stuff in the Middle East, the increase in anti-Semitism is through the roof. The amount [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=196.16s)]
*  of stuff I get sent to me every day and even people who will defend these kids is insane. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=201.04000000000002s)]
*  And I think, you know, it's a combo of factors, but certainly social media allows faceless names [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=207.76s)]
*  to say things, do things and pile on. And, you know, if you're unhappy with your life or [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=215.36s)]
*  you're miserable and you're looking for a scapegoat, suddenly it's all the Jews' problem. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=220.96s)]
*  Either seems like there's a lot of that. And I don't even think people know like these kids, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=224.56s)]
*  I highly doubt they're very familiar with the plight of, you know, or history of the Jewish [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=230.56s)]
*  nation. And I don't think they're certainly protesting what's going on in, you know, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=235.68s)]
*  Palestine or with Hamas. They're just ignorant. So hopefully going and visiting will put some [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=240.48s)]
*  emphasis and make them reflect a little bit before they're absolute jerks. I'm sure you saw some of [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=247.84s)]
*  the responses from people who think that this kind of punishment is not really a punishment, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=252.95999999999998s)]
*  as if you are sending them on a vacation and a trip to Europe and how great that's going to be. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=258.4s)]
*  How do you respond to that kind of criticism? Yeah, I'm getting a lot of Jewish people saying [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=263.2s)]
*  that. I'm getting mad at them. They're like, this is the worst solution ever. You're sending [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=268.48s)]
*  them on a paid vacation, like you said, like they're going to the Bahamas. This is not, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=273.44s)]
*  this is going to be a teaching moment. And I don't know anybody who would love to do a no-frills trip [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=277.52000000000004s)]
*  to Poland to have what should really be a saddening and disheartening teaching moment. And if that [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=284.0s)]
*  doesn't get through to these kids, guess what? Nothing will. And who cares if you're ruining [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=292.16s)]
*  your life because they're just going to be jerks and do it again. But to me, this was the best [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=296.48s)]
*  option. In no way do I think this is some win for them. Like they're going to Ibiza or something, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=300.40000000000003s)]
*  going to be clubbing. No, they're going on a very strict regiment tailored visit to one of the worst [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=306.56s)]
*  atrocities mankind. So, you know, there is no great solution, but I put my head together with some [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=314.0s)]
*  other I consider smart people and this is what we came up with. And we appreciate you coming on the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=321.84000000000003s)]
*  show. Thank you so much, Dave Fortnoy. Thank you. Good luck with that, Dave. Thanks. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20lSgXiSDQc&t=326.24s)]
