# Biden’s ‘come-to-Jesus’ warning caught on hot mic at State of the Union
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [March 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4)
*  OK, so for more on this, joining me live is Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's foreign [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=0.0s)]
*  policy adviser, Ofeir Fok. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=4.2s)]
*  Ofeir, thank you for joining the show on this Saturday. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=6.16s)]
*  I want to ask you at the top here about this announcement from the president to have U.S. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=9.44s)]
*  troops build this pier into Gaza to get humanitarian aid into those civilians. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=15.4s)]
*  What are your initial thoughts, concerns about this? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  Well, thank you for having me. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=26.28s)]
*  The temporary pier that will be set there is completely coordinated with Israel, and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=29.52s)]
*  we welcome the opportunity to enable additional humanitarian aid to get into the humans, to [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=34.96s)]
*  the civilians. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=42.2s)]
*  And we've got to make sure that that civilian humanitarian aid reaches the actual civilians [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=43.2s)]
*  and not Hamas. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  The coordination, I know the two countries, you know, have been trying to figure a way [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=51.72s)]
*  forward and trying to get a hostage deal done with Hamas. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=57.06s)]
*  But the president was caught on a hot mic at the State of the Union. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=63.52s)]
*  I'm sure you've heard about this and seen this, where he's caught saying that he wants [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=67.06s)]
*  to have a come-to-Jesus meeting with the prime minister. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=71.9s)]
*  And I think we have the sound here. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=76.30000000000001s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=77.54s)]
*  We've got to keep pushing, pushing forward on the humanitarian stuff. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=78.54s)]
*  I told you. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=83.22s)]
*  Baby, I'm going to get this. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=86.22s)]
*  I said, baby, I'm going to get this. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=89.22s)]
*  You're just... [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=92.22s)]
*  Okay, so you hear some other senators laugh about it. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=93.22s)]
*  Does the president need to have a come-to-Jesus meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=97.58000000000001s)]
*  Well, the president and prime minister, Netanyahu, have spoken dozens of times since the beginning [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=101.5s)]
*  of the war. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=107.74000000000001s)]
*  And you'd have to ask him what he meant by that statement. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=109.06s)]
*  It's not clear to me. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=113.42s)]
*  Do you take offense to it? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=114.78s)]
*  Again, Israel appreciates the support that the president has provided to Israel, the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=117.22s)]
*  bipartisan support, and primarily the great support of the American people. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=123.94s)]
*  The American people strongly support Israel, and we thank the American people for that. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=128.78s)]
*  We share the same values. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=133.14000000000001s)]
*  And they know that we have to destroy Hamas. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=134.86s)]
*  The American people know that we have to destroy Hamas. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=136.9s)]
*  We have to free our hostages, and we must make sure that Gaza doesn't pose a threat [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=139.58s)]
*  to Israel ever again. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=145.42000000000002s)]
*  That's what we're doing. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=147.82s)]
*  Those are our war goals, and we will reach those goals. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=148.82s)]
*  That's total victory, and we will reach total victory. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=151.1s)]
*  It's within reach. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=154.62s)]
*  We've already taken out... [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=155.62s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=156.62s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=157.62s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=158.62s)]
*  I'm so sorry to cut you off. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=159.62s)]
*  I guess let me put it this way. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=160.62s)]
*  Are you confident that President Biden is confident in the current prime minister? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=161.9s)]
*  Because of course, a huge headline a few days ago was that your defense minister was here [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=168.38s)]
*  at the White House. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=174.34s)]
*  So what's going on here? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=175.66s)]
*  Well, actually, our defense minister was here in Israel. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=177.54000000000002s)]
*  There was another minister that paid a private visit to Washington. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=180.86s)]
*  But we are in complete coordination with the U.S. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=186.54000000000002s)]
*  We are on the same page in terms of the need to destroy Hamas. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=190.26s)]
*  It's a genocidal terrorist organization that invaded Israel on the 7th of October, murdered [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=194.1s)]
*  1,200 Israelis, took 250 people hostage. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=200.26s)]
*  And we are right now taking... [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=204.5s)]
*  Waging war on Hamas, not the Palestinian people, but on Hamas. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=206.01999999999998s)]
*  We are going to destroy Hamas. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=210.94s)]
*  We've already taken out 19 out of their 24 brigades. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=212.29999999999998s)]
*  We're going to take out the final four in Rafah. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=215.22s)]
*  We're going to free our hostages and we're going to make sure the Gaza doesn't pose as [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=218.14s)]
*  a threat to us. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=221.78s)]
*  That's also the... [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=223.26s)]
*  I'm sure that's the American interest as well. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=224.26s)]
*  And we thank the American people for their very strong support in Israel. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=226.54s)]
*  In a recent poll, over 80 percent of the American people expressed very strong support for Israel [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=230.22s)]
*  in this war against Hamas, which is a genocidal terrorist organization. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=237.06s)]
*  And the world will be much better off once we destroy Hamas. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=241.54s)]
*  Sir, there's... [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=245.98s)]
*  We have live pictures right now from Israel showing protests happening in Tel Aviv. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=246.98s)]
*  These are families of the hostages, supporters calling on those hostages to be released, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=251.57999999999998s)]
*  calling on the government to do more. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=257.54s)]
*  These families have gone now five long painful months without their loved ones. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=260.42s)]
*  This deal, it feels like it just keeps on getting stalled and stalled. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=266.82s)]
*  What can you tell us about the latest on this hostage deal? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=271.74s)]
*  Well, clearly, I can't get into details of negotiations. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=275.66s)]
*  But I can tell you, as the president has said, they're way over the top, the Hamas. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=280.66s)]
*  Their demands are delusional. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=287.94000000000005s)]
*  And once they come down to earth, we'll be able to do a deal like we did in November. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=289.82000000000005s)]
*  We've already gotten 112 hostages out. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=295.18s)]
*  The main reason for getting these hostages out is military pressure, which the IDF is [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=298.02000000000004s)]
*  carrying out as we're doing right now, as we're talking right now. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=302.5s)]
*  The IDF has taken the war to Hamas and firm negotiations. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=305.38s)]
*  We at any rate are willing to do a deal just like we did in November. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=309.54s)]
*  We want to get our hostages out. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=313.26s)]
*  There's 134 hostages out, including 18 women. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=315.21999999999997s)]
*  And I think it's important on International Women's Day to reiterate, there are 18 Israeli [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=318.94s)]
*  women being held by these savages, by these Hamas savages. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=323.82s)]
*  And anybody who has true humanitarian issues at heart should demand the immediate and unconditional [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=327.78s)]
*  release of the hostages. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=334.85999999999996s)]
*  Just very quickly here, Serge, as we have five seconds left, do you have any sort of [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=336.94s)]
*  a timeline or a hope as to when we might get a deal? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=340.7s)]
*  The second that Hamas' demands are not delusional anymore, we'll have a deal. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=347.41999999999996s)]
*  In the meantime, we were destroying Hamas. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=352.73999999999995s)]
*  Okay, Ofer Fakh, thank you very much for joining the show. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDN8Y0mgM4&t=354.85999999999996s)]
