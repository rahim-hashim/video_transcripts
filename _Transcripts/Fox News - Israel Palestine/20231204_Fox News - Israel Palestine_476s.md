# Trey Yingst: The images from Gaza are devastating
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w)
*  This is a Fox News alert this morning on a Monday. The U.S. launching a drone strike [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=0.0s)]
*  in northern Iraq, killing five Iranian proxy fighters. This is the fifth time the U.S. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  has carried out retaliatory strikes in Iraq and Syria over the past month. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=16.16s)]
*  Meanwhile, in the Gaza Strip, the IDF advances deeper into the region, taking out at least [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=20.68s)]
*  200 Hamas targets overnight. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=25.64s)]
*  Trey Yanks is live in southern Israel with the latest. So Trey, the ceasefire is over. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=28.76s)]
*  What's the latest on the ground? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=34.56s)]
*  Yeah, hey guys, good morning. The ceasefire is indeed over. Just a few moments ago we [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=36.56s)]
*  saw two rockets intercepted just next to this position along the Gaza border. It's day 59 [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  of the war between Israel and Hamas, and the Israelis are increasing their strikes against [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=49.24s)]
*  the Gaza Strip. They say overnight 200 different targets were hit inside Gaza, bringing the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=55.16s)]
*  total number to more than 10,000 since this war began on October 7th. Now the heavy air [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=59.72s)]
*  campaign is spiking the death toll in Gaza. Authorities at the Hamas-controlled health [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=64.84s)]
*  ministry say more than 700 people were killed in a 24-hour period over the weekend. Israel [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=69.32s)]
*  still going after Hamas leadership, killing the commander of the Shati battalion in an [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=74.92s)]
*  air strike on Sunday. Also over the weekend they killed Wissam Farhat, the commander of [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=79.16s)]
*  Hamas's Sajia battalion. Farhat was responsible for the deaths of seven soldiers during the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=83.88s)]
*  2014 war, and he actually participated in the planning of the October 7th massacre. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=88.75999999999999s)]
*  Israel is also expanding their ground operations, starting to target positions near Gaza's southern [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=94.32s)]
*  city of Hanunis. The developments on the ground do come as regional threats continue to expand. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=98.88s)]
*  Yesterday three commercial vessels in the Red Sea were attacked by Iran-backed Houthi [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=104.12s)]
*  rebels from Yemen. The USS Carney shot down three drones that were in its area, highlighting the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=108.02s)]
*  role that American forces in the region are playing. Now back in October, the same guided [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=112.89999999999999s)]
*  missile destroyer shot down a salvo of missiles and drones that were headed toward Israel. It's [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=117.34s)]
*  not just the southern front that remains active, also activity on the northern front today as [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=122.38s)]
*  Hezbollah renews attacks into northern Israel. Guys? Hey, so Trey, it sounds like the IDF hit 200 [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=126.66s)]
*  targets overnight. Apparently they found, and you would know more about this than we are because [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=134.34s)]
*  we're over here, apparently they found tunnels and weapons in a school and one of the tunnels [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=140.1s)]
*  was booby-trapped and that just goes to everything the Israelis have said. You know, they put bad [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=147.02s)]
*  stuff in good places. Yeah, absolutely, and if it wasn't so hazy today, I'd actually show you the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=153.38s)]
*  area where they found that tunnel shaft. It's in the Bet Hanun neighborhood just behind me, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=161.18s)]
*  across the border in the northern part of the Gaza Strip, and 58 days into the conflict, Hamas was [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=166.06s)]
*  still firing rockets from this neighborhood, and so it gives you a sense of the infrastructure that [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=172.5s)]
*  they created over the past several years in these densely populated areas. We saw it for ourselves [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=177.46s)]
*  when we went into Gaza with the Israeli military. Many of the weapons are being stored in schools, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=182.38s)]
*  they're being stored in these civilian areas, and it's creating a very challenging situation [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=188.45999999999998s)]
*  for the Israelis. And look, they are targeting not just the northern part of Gaza now, but also [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=192.54s)]
*  the second largest city of Hanunas, and I've been talking with a Palestinian doctor in the southern [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=197.22s)]
*  city of Rafah, and he says there's airstrikes all around that area, so this is a concerted effort [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=201.82s)]
*  by the Israelis to put more pressure on Hamas, try to get those additional hostages released, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=206.78s)]
*  but also destroy as many of those weapons storage facilities as possible. Yeah, Trey, the city, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=211.34s)]
*  Hanunas, is the second largest city in that area, and they've told the Palestinians there to leave [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=216.34s)]
*  and to evacuate if they can. I know that Israel and Hamas has failed to come up with some sort of [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=221.78s)]
*  a deal. That's why the fighting has continued. No more ceasefire to free all of the women [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=226.9s)]
*  hostages. What's the latest on the hostages? Because they're saying that they have found 800 [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=231.86s)]
*  tunnels in Gaza, 500 have been destroyed or sealed. Have they found any hostages? So they [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=236.06s)]
*  haven't found any hostages. They have recovered a couple bodies of those that were taken into [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=243.5s)]
*  Gaza, and that's changed the numbers slightly. But over the weekend, there were efforts in Doha, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=247.82s)]
*  Qatar to get the ceasefire back together after it expired after a violation by Hamas firing [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=252.7s)]
*  rockets into Israel on Friday morning. We understand there was an Israeli Mossad team in Doha, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=258.9s)]
*  and regional sources told me over the weekend that the Israelis actually returned home. They [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=264.42s)]
*  wanted to send a message in all of this that the conversations were not headed in a positive [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=269.86s)]
*  direction. So both the Israeli prime minister and the director of the Mossad pulled the team back [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=273.42s)]
*  here to Israel. Though those regional sources say the negotiations continue, they want to see if [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=278.26s)]
*  they can get more hostages out through diplomatic channels, understanding that the more than 100 [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=283.1s)]
*  people still being held inside Gaza may not be recovered through the means and the efforts of [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=287.58000000000004s)]
*  Israeli forces that are operating on the ground. Yeah, it's predicted the international pressure [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=292.5s)]
*  against Israel is ramping up. I just wonder in Gaza, since Hamas continues to use its own people [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=298.98s)]
*  as shields, is there more pressure, and I know there's been a little bit reporting on it, to get [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=307.06s)]
*  rid of Hamas, to take back authority of the Gaza area. There's a lot of pressure on Hamas, and people [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=312.46000000000004s)]
*  are becoming increasingly vocal about their frustration of how this conflict began. And look, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=322.54s)]
*  Israel is walking a tightrope here in terms of American and Western support for their efforts [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=328.58s)]
*  to find the hostages and destroy Hamas leadership, while also balancing the pressure and criticism, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=333.14s)]
*  rightly so, that they are receiving for the rising civilian death toll. We cannot independently [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=338.82s)]
*  confirm the numbers that we're receiving from Gaza, because they're coming from the Hamas [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=343.53999999999996s)]
*  controlled health ministry. But we know for a fact that thousands of civilians are dying, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=347.14s)]
*  and the images from inside Gaza are devastating. Children that are trapped under rubble, civilians [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=351.46s)]
*  that are being killed in these strikes as the Israelis go after Hamas leadership, and as the [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=357.06s)]
*  days go on, and this war increases with both air and ground campaigns against Gaza, that pressure [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=361.62s)]
*  on the Israeli government and military will also increase. And Trey, to your point, there's also a [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=367.3s)]
*  lot of pressure on the Israeli government from the people of Israel, because I was reading this [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=372.98s)]
*  morning that apparently the hostage families, they know that the ceasefire is over. Israel has [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=378.66s)]
*  withdrawn the negotiators, and for the most part, the ground offensive, as you've been detailing, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=385.94s)]
*  is on. The families of the hostages still stuck in Gaza somewhere. They want to meet with the [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=394.1s)]
*  war council, because they want to be reassured that the government of Israel will stop at nothing to [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=399.62s)]
*  bring them back, because they're afraid their people are going to get killed in the crossfire. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=405.94s)]
*  Absolutely. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has faced a lot of criticism from the families of [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=409.7s)]
*  hostages. Today, in Israeli media, the focus is on the families of these soldiers that are being held [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=418.02s)]
*  inside Gaza. They're putting pressure, and they are calling for the prime minister to meet with them, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=423.62s)]
*  and so far, other top officials from the war cabinet and from the government have agreed to [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=428.26s)]
*  meet with these families, but the prime minister himself has not. We understand that has changed, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=433.21999999999997s)]
*  that later today or tomorrow, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to meet [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=437.22s)]
*  with the families of those soldiers that are being held inside Gaza, but there is pressure, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=442.1s)]
*  and we even saw over the weekend in hostage square in Tel Aviv, families of those who were released [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=446.58000000000004s)]
*  speaking out, calling for every single hostage to be brought home. They want to do whatever it takes, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=452.26000000000005s)]
*  whether it's increasing the diplomacy, whether it's increasing the ground operation, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=456.98s)]
*  they want to get these hostages home, and it's not just those individuals, it's this entire country [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=460.82000000000005s)]
*  of 9 million people. You see the yellow ribbons, you see the calls on social media, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=465.78s)]
*  people want to do whatever it takes to get their loved ones home. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC4Isas5k9w&t=470.09999999999997s)]
