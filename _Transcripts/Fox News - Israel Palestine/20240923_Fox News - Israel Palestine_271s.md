# Hezbollah leaders killed were planning their own Oct 7 attack: Report
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [September 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0)
*  Let's bring in Robert Charles, former Assistant Secretary of State for George W. Bush and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=0.0s)]
*  a former naval intel officer. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=3.88s)]
*  Charles, Bobby Charles, your assessment of the breaking news, the strikes that are happening [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=6.32s)]
*  as we speak. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Yep. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  I think Americans should stay focused on both the tactical and the strategic aspects of [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=14.48s)]
*  this. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=19.84s)]
*  Tactically, this is a move upwards. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=20.84s)]
*  This is an escalation of that conflict, which is regional and could become global. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=22.26s)]
*  Strategically, there's a couple of things to keep in mind. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=26.32s)]
*  Hezbollah is the largest surrogate of Iran in the region, and Hezbollah is sort of Hamas [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=29.08s)]
*  on steroids. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=35.56s)]
*  So really, this is a conflict with Iran. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=36.56s)]
*  Another thing to keep in mind is that Hezbollah has operatives in this country. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=39.36s)]
*  There have been more than 100 arrests in recent years of people either financially or operationally [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=42.48s)]
*  trying to help Hezbollah in this country. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=47.32s)]
*  So something again to keep in mind. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=49.76s)]
*  But the big strategic piece here is that if a ceasefire does not happen soon, ultimately [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=51.36s)]
*  it is a big fail for the Biden-Harris administration. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=56.6s)]
*  And why is that? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=60.28s)]
*  Because first of all, Russia and China then get an opening to do all kinds of things in [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=62.04s)]
*  chaos, with chaos occurring in the Middle East. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=65.44s)]
*  In addition, you get the, ultimately it's a diplomatic fail on the part of the administration, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=68.34s)]
*  which means in the end that it helps Trump. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=73.0s)]
*  And ironically, sort of the second or third order effect in here is that Iran does not [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=76.2s)]
*  want to see Trump reelected because it would dramatically affect their future. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=80.56s)]
*  Iran will probably pull back, but escalation is a real possibility here. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=84.68s)]
*  This is higher and more intense conflict than we have seen in a long time, probably since [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=89.12s)]
*  2006 in this region. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=93.32s)]
*  And I would encourage people to remember that Israel has the ability to defend itself with [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=95.76s)]
*  nuclear weapons, which should in some ways put Iran back on their heels. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=101.08s)]
*  Robert, I want you to listen to right now, again, all deference. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=105.6s)]
*  This was 24 hours ago when John Kirby was on Fox News Sunday. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=109.68s)]
*  But nevertheless, the information and the attitude coming out of this administration [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=113.16s)]
*  remains the same. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=118.03999999999999s)]
*  Here's John Kirby. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  We still believe that there is time and space for diplomacy to work here. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  We understand that it's not moving in the best direction, but that doesn't mean we think [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=125.48s)]
*  that engaging in another full front, another all out war in the North is the best thing [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=130.0s)]
*  for Israel. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=134.4s)]
*  Robert, specifically, he was referring to a report that Israel managed to stop a second [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=135.72s)]
*  October 7th, which for them is their equivalent of 9-11 with some very, very targeted strikes [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=143.72s)]
*  to some very senior Hezbollah leaders. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=149.64000000000001s)]
*  To be clear, Israel prevented their next 9-11, and yet John Kirby is questioning them? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=152.5s)]
*  That makes no sense to me. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=160.18s)]
*  What say you? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=161.32s)]
*  Yeah, you're absolutely right, Todd. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=162.32s)]
*  We should not be ambivalent here. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=164.67999999999998s)]
*  We should not be confused here. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=166.29999999999998s)]
*  We should be very direct in our support for Israel, because I've read those reports too, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=168.28s)]
*  and it looks like there was an intent of Hezbollah to come in again, and this time in even larger [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=172.28s)]
*  numbers. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=177.66s)]
*  So at the end of the day, what this really means is that if we need to support Israel [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=178.66s)]
*  unequivocally, this is a different, this is the choice between deterrence and appeasement. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=182.34s)]
*  And in the end, unfortunately, the Biden-Harris crowd has been very much about appeasement. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=187.6s)]
*  I don't think there's any room for that anymore. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=191.84s)]
*  I think at this stage of the game, everything has to be about deterrence, which means, Todd, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=194.18s)]
*  that we need to tell people, we need to tell the world, and our allies need to tell the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=197.78s)]
*  world that we stand with Israel in their own defense. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=201.06s)]
*  For the first time ever, Hezbollah, surrogate for Iran, has actually been hitting pieces [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=203.98000000000002s)]
*  of the Iron Dome and the Iron Dome production facilities. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=209.34s)]
*  So they're truly trying to take this up a notch. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=212.94000000000003s)]
*  But if they take it up too many notches, I think they're going to be sorry they did. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=215.46s)]
*  With that as the backdrop, the Iranian president arrives here in New York City ahead of his [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=218.82000000000002s)]
*  address to the U.N. General Assembly tomorrow. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=222.68s)]
*  Need a quick answer on this, Robert. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=225.36s)]
*  When the General Assembly is over, will the Iranian president return to Iran scared or [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=227.16s)]
*  emboldened? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=232.8s)]
*  I would like to believe that the message he receives once being here is that he needs [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=235.52s)]
*  to back off, back down and back away. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=240.32000000000002s)]
*  But I don't think that's going to happen. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=242.60000000000002s)]
*  I think that what we're going to hear is, again, probably more ambivalence and a kind [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=243.92000000000002s)]
*  of mealy-mouthed response to what he has to say. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=247.76000000000002s)]
*  He, of course, will be very anti-American and very anti-Israeli. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=250.76s)]
*  On our soil, and yet we placate it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=254.48s)]
*  Makes no sense. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=256.56s)]
*  Robert Charles, thanks for your insight on a breaking news morning. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=257.56s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fdz_ysrvG0&t=259.36s)]
