# Joe Biden is in trouble with the 'Hamas wing' of the Democrat Party: Rep. Nancy Mace
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [June 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI)
*  Joining me now is South Carolina Republican Congresswoman Nancy Mace. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=0.0s)]
*  Congresswoman, welcome. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=2.84s)]
*  Thank you for having me, Mike. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=4.96s)]
*  What is your reaction to President Biden's trip to France? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=6.24s)]
*  What are your takeaways? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=9.32s)]
*  Well, in just the video you just saw there, a very frail and out of it [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=11.4s)]
*  president of the United States, which really weakens us on the world stage. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=15.64s)]
*  He could barely walk. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=19.2s)]
*  He could barely stand upright. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=20.76s)]
*  He could barely form a sentence and he wouldn't answer reporters questions. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=21.96s)]
*  Um, and this weakens us on the world stage. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=25.84s)]
*  And all I can think about is how quickly we can get a stronger leader, both [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=28.0s)]
*  physically and mentally back into the white house. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=31.76s)]
*  November cannot come fast enough. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=33.88s)]
*  On the Middle East, the Biden administration continues pushing Hamas to [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=36.2s)]
*  accept a deal for a ceasefire. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=39.6s)]
*  Here's national security advisor, Jake Sullivan. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=42.16s)]
*  Hamas hides among civilian infrastructure, hides underground, uh, and puts the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  Palestinian people in harm's way. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=52.96s)]
*  There could be a ceasefire if Hamas would just step up and say yes to the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=55.08s)]
*  deal that the Israelis have accepted and that president Biden elaborated a week ago. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=59.8s)]
*  So the world should call on Hamas to take this deal. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  Do you think that deal will ever happen? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=66.52s)]
*  No, it never will happen. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=69.24s)]
*  It as if a terrorist organization like Hamas or Hezbollah or somebody is going to [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=70.56s)]
*  negotiate for peace in the Middle East. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=75.08s)]
*  No, but you know, when we did have peace in the Middle East, it was under [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=76.92s)]
*  Donald Trump who brought us the Abraham Accords because under his leadership, we [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=80.24s)]
*  didn't have Hamas invading Israel. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=84.36s)]
*  We didn't have the Houthis in Yemen trying to bomb U.S. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=86.0s)]
*  military assets in the Middle East. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=88.96s)]
*  We also didn't have Russia invading Ukraine. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=90.56s)]
*  We were all a lot safer around the world, including our allies, when Donald Trump [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=92.88s)]
*  was president, because when you look at their back to back presidencies, the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=97.88s)]
*  contrast could not be any more different. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=101.56s)]
*  I covered the pro-Palestinian rally outside the White House yesterday where [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=105.0s)]
*  they tried to create a human red line around the White House. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=108.68s)]
*  Here's one of the lead organizers of that event. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=112.28s)]
*  Joe Biden, you may speak in our name, but not with our consent. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=120.0s)]
*  We charge you with genocide. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=125.56s)]
*  That if Joe Biden's red line was a fiction, that it was a lie, that it was an [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=127.88s)]
*  act of deception, that it was designed to make us become quiet. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=134.92s)]
*  Is President Biden in trouble with young voters and in states like Michigan, a [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=141.4s)]
*  battleground state with large Arab and Muslim populations? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=145.96s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=150.64s)]
*  Joe Biden is in trouble with the Hamas wing of the Democrat Party. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=151.44s)]
*  And the irony here is we just heard Jake Sullivan admit that Hamas uses [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=154.48s)]
*  civilian civilians and commit genocide with their own innocent civilian people. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=158.32s)]
*  And yet these, these folks think that there'll be peace in the Middle East [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=163.4s)]
*  and with a ceasefire and there just won't be. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=166.92s)]
*  These people need to be eradicated off the face of the earth. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=168.76s)]
*  The United States should support Israel and the IDF to do everything in their [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=171.52s)]
*  power possible to get rid of Hamas so that they no longer exist because this [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=174.68s)]
*  doesn't end with Israel. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=178.92s)]
*  This is Jihad. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=180.2s)]
*  This is Jihadism. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=181.4s)]
*  Israel is the tip of the spear. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=182.72s)]
*  Today it's Israel, but the next it'll be the West. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=184.16s)]
*  It'll be the United States. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=186.28s)]
*  They will come after us until we're all gone. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=187.28s)]
*  We have got to eradicate terrorism in the Middle East. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=189.2s)]
*  It struck me that there seemed to be a lot of college students out there [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=192.56s)]
*  yesterday at that rally that we're showing our audience right now. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=195.48s)]
*  What does that say to you about indoctrination on our college campuses? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=198.84s)]
*  Well, these, these college campuses shouldn't be getting U.S. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=203.28s)]
*  taxpayer dollars or subsidies from the U.S. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=206.6s)]
*  government to indoctrinate our children, to indoctrinate our students. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=209.0s)]
*  This is absurd. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=212.8s)]
*  We've all seen videos of Jewish students who could not and cannot go to class on [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=214.12s)]
*  U.S. college campuses. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=218.92s)]
*  This is not 1944 Nazi Germany. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=220.6s)]
*  These people are bigots. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=223.36s)]
*  These people are Jew haters and they shouldn't be on our college campuses. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=224.52s)]
*  If you love Hamas so much, go to Gaza. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=228.12s)]
*  See how long you last on a roof in Gaza. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=230.36s)]
*  I can tell you it won't be very long. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=232.56s)]
*  I was also struck that they were defacing some of the statues there outside the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=234.76000000000002s)]
*  White House. It makes you wonder if authorities will go after them. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=239.0s)]
*  There are cameras all over that park. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=242.12s)]
*  Will they actually go after the people who defaced federal property? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=244.56s)]
*  They never will because they have a D by their name. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=249.48000000000002s)]
*  We know how Republicans and conservatives are treated by the Department of Justice [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=252.16s)]
*  and the FBI versus Antifa, versus Hamas sympathizers, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=256.0s)]
*  versus violence on these college campuses, versus Black Lives Matter. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=260.2s)]
*  If they don't get held to the same standard as everybody else does, they'll get [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=263.92s)]
*  a free hall pass absolutely in this. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=267.0s)]
*  President Biden will return to Europe for the G7 summit. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=270.32s)]
*  What are your expectations? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=274.2s)]
*  I have no expectations for this president. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=276.44s)]
*  I expect other world leaders to mock the United States, to mock Joe Biden, to mock [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=279.12s)]
*  the administration, who clearly don't know what they're doing, who clearly are not [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=283.52s)]
*  operating from a position of strength. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=287.4s)]
*  All we are doing is projecting weakness around the world, weakness for our allies. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  And that is why there is so much turmoil in the Middle East. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=293.04s)]
*  That is why the Houthis are bombing U.S. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=296.24s)]
*  assets in the Middle East. That is why Hamas felt the need that they could invade [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=298.52s)]
*  Israel. That's why Putin invaded Ukraine. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=302.52s)]
*  Because look at this guy. He is not a leader on the world stage. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=305.0s)]
*  We need strength in the White House. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=308.12s)]
*  That means we need Donald Trump in November. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=309.44s)]
*  It cannot come fast enough. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=311.56s)]
*  Congresswoman Nancy Mase of the great state of South Carolina, thank you so much for [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=313.24s)]
*  your time today. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROOxhuNGvI&t=316.76s)]
