# FBI investigating chilling, anti-Jewish threat at Cornell
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE)
*  One of the ironies is that as an American Jew, you're safer in Saudi Arabia right now [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=0.0s)]
*  than you are in a college campus like Columbia University. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Former senior Trump adviser Jared Kushner on Sunday Morning Futures yesterday as anti-Semitic [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  sentiment spreads across American college campuses. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=13.76s)]
*  And now the FBI is investigating a violent threat against Jewish students posted on the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=16.8s)]
*  bulletin board at Cornell University. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=21.92s)]
*  Alexis McAdam is following the story live in New York City. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=23.900000000000002s)]
*  Alexis, was this directly related to the university? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=27.0s)]
*  Dana, right now this morning they're trying to figure out exactly who posted that. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=29.6s)]
*  It was on a student message board, but it wasn't affiliated with the university. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  So a lot of people waking up there on the campus are worried for their safety. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=39.36s)]
*  We'll get to more on that in a second. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  But we know, Dana, that a lot of these campuses, right, have been the epicenter of ongoing [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=44.56s)]
*  protests like here at Columbia University. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=48.36s)]
*  Now Cornell University increasing security on campus at the Student Jewish Center there [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=50.96s)]
*  after the school says a series of quote, horrendous anti-Semitic messages were posted on an online [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=55.88s)]
*  discussion board. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=60.32s)]
*  The messages Dana called on people to follow, attack and kill Jewish students on campus [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=61.32s)]
*  and also threatened to shoot up that kosher dining hall. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=66.48s)]
*  Right now sources telling Fox News the FBI is investigating this to see if it was a hate [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=69.76s)]
*  crime which could lead to federal charges here. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=74.0s)]
*  So keeping a close eye on that. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=76.76s)]
*  This comes to after you might remember that Cornell professor called the Hamas attacks [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=78.04s)]
*  exhilarating. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=82.48s)]
*  He's on the leave of absence that he requested after the university said those comments were [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=83.60000000000001s)]
*  reprehensible. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=87.24000000000001s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  It was exhilarating. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=89.24000000000001s)]
*  It was agitating. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  If they weren't exhilarating by this challenge to evaporate violence, by this shifting of [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  the violence of power, then they wouldn't have been you and I. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  It's f***ing exhilarating. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  And it's not just on college campuses. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=110.72s)]
*  It's also those protests in the streets across the country. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=112.74s)]
*  You're looking at what happened at Grand Central Station, Dana and Martha, just on Friday. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=116.17999999999999s)]
*  Hundreds of people were arrested after a sit in there that all happened during rush hour. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=121.1s)]
*  So if you can watch this. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=126.46s)]
*  And the Brooklyn Bridge also packed with pro-Palestinian supporters over the weekend. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=134.98s)]
*  Hundreds marching, calling on the United States to stop sending aid to Israel. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=138.38000000000002s)]
*  And out in Chicago, another weekend packed of protests, thousands walking the streets [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=142.74s)]
*  and chanting to free Palestine. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=147.58s)]
*  Back out here at Columbia University in New York, they've had a lot of protests on both [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=149.3s)]
*  sides of this. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=153.06s)]
*  And we're going to hear from pro-Israel students and Jewish students who are calling on the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=154.06s)]
*  university, Dana, to do more and speak up against anti-Semitism. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=158.34s)]
*  We'll keep a close eye on what's happening at Cornell. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=161.62s)]
*  Dana? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=163.78s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=164.78s)]
*  Alexis, thank you. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IQDecRKGYE&t=165.78s)]
