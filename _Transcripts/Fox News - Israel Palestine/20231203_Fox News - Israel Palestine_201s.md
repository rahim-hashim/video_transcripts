# Iran-backed Houthi rebels attack US destroyer USS Carney in Red Sea
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U)
*  More on today's attacks in the Red Sea and the USS Kearney's involvement. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's bring in former U.S. Central Command spokesperson and retired U.S. Army Colonel [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  Joe Buccino. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=8.620000000000001s)]
*  Joe, you heard Leon Panetta, the former defense secretary, suggest that he would like to see [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=9.620000000000001s)]
*  a more muscular response from the administration. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=15.0s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=17.34s)]
*  I think that's unequivocal. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=18.34s)]
*  I think we've seen dozens and dozens and dozens of these attacks, and so far we've struck [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=20.580000000000002s)]
*  some buildings in Syria. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=25.62s)]
*  We've struck some of these proxy forces in Syria. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=27.4s)]
*  These are things, these buildings, ammo depots, a handful of troops, these are things Iran [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=31.619999999999997s)]
*  does not care about. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=36.56s)]
*  So in order to introduce deterrence, deterrence is in the mind, John. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=38.56s)]
*  And so in order to introduce deterrence over Iran or over anybody, you need two things. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=44.3s)]
*  You need to demonstrate you have capability to inflict harm. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=49.379999999999995s)]
*  OK, that's clear. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=53.22s)]
*  We pushed all these assets like the USS Kearney into the region. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=54.28s)]
*  The second thing is your adversary has to understand you have the will to inflict harm, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=58.58s)]
*  inflict pain. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=65.38s)]
*  And right now, Iran does not think that this administration has the will to do so. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=66.38s)]
*  And I think they're probably right. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=71.5s)]
*  I know you used to work at CENTCOM, and I want to read part of the CENTCOM statement [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=73.74000000000001s)]
*  that came out today about these various attacks. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  Part of it said, we also have every reason to believe that these attacks, while launched [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=83.12s)]
*  by the Houthis in Yemen, are fully enabled by Iran. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=87.2s)]
*  The United States will consider all appropriate responses. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=92.08s)]
*  It seems to me that, you know, in the past we haven't mentioned Iran's involvement. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=96.4s)]
*  I could be wrong about that, but we're definitely pointing fingers at them in this particular [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=102.12s)]
*  announcement, and do you think they're getting the message? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=107.64s)]
*  I do not think they're getting the message. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=112.58s)]
*  I think that in the messaging, one thing that's unclear is we pushed these carrier strike [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=114.5s)]
*  groups into the region. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=121.34s)]
*  So we pushed all these assets. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=122.98s)]
*  What are they doing? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=124.98s)]
*  What are they there to do? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=126.58s)]
*  What are they there to respond to? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=128.18s)]
*  What are they there to strike? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=129.62s)]
*  What's the broader point relative to Iran? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=130.82s)]
*  That's not been clear in the messaging coming out of Tampa with Central Command or coming [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=134.66s)]
*  out of Washington, D.C. here in the Pentagon. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=139.02s)]
*  I think this one goes a step further than the previous statements we've seen, as you've [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=142.74s)]
*  identified, John, mentioning Iran. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=149.14s)]
*  But I don't know that that gets it done. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=152.26s)]
*  Think about previous times where we have established a turn over on, you know, 1988, the tanker [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=156.06s)]
*  wars, this back and forth in the Arabian Gulf, like a little bit like we have now. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=161.3s)]
*  We struck 1988. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=167.36s)]
*  We struck two Iranian oil platforms. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  And Iran got the message that put a cap on escalation because that's something that Iran [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=172.4s)]
*  cares about. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=176.52s)]
*  And then there was the targeting of Qassem Soleimani during the Trump administration. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=177.52s)]
*  That seemed to send a message as well. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=183.24s)]
*  Retired U.S. Army Colonel Joe Baccino, thank you. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bVLlZ-G6U&t=186.36s)]
