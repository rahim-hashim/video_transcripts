# 'Are you f------- kidding me?': Maher RIPS liberals for supporting Hamas
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc)
*  Politico writer rolling out his own Democrat shadow cabinet to respond to the Trump administration and fix the party's problem [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=0.0s)]
*  To speak plainly to Americans. So who's included they're on your screen right now names like entrepreneur Mark Cuban TV host [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=7.2s)]
*  Bill Nye and comedians John Stewart and Nikki Glaser Fox News contributor and senior writer for the Washington Examiner Joe Concha [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=14.8s)]
*  Not on that list, but he does join me now Joe. What the heck's the point of this fever dream? Oh [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=21.52s)]
*  Oh [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=27.96s)]
*  Todd I know it's only May but this is by far the dumbest piece you will read all year [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=28.96s)]
*  I mean for starters, we already had a shadow cabinet running this country that was called the Biden administration [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=34.16s)]
*  When we had a president whose brain turned applesauce and apparently all these other people were running the AutoPen and that was just so [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=40.24s)]
*  You know [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=47.8s)]
*  Inept but perhaps Bill Nye the science guy Nikki Glaser Letitia James who may be going to jail [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=48.82s)]
*  Those could be considered possible upgrades compared to what we just saw [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=54.76s)]
*  But this is all media outlets like Politico have at this point because Donald Trump right now is soaring in the polls [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=57.96s)]
*  Rashmussin Todd even shows that more people believed that the country is on the right track than the wrong track [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=64.84s)]
*  That has never happened in the history of Rasmussen polling more and more polls show Trump exceeding 50% approval [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=70.14s)]
*  So, you know when you look at Biden's shadow government or this proposed shadow government [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=77.8s)]
*  I don't understand the point because the current government right now [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=83.22000000000001s)]
*  According to the people is doing quite well on the economy on the border and all the issues that people care about most [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=86.06s)]
*  But Joe, I think you actually hit on something really interesting and it's this notion that actually came out in the original sin book that we've been [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=92.34s)]
*  Covering over the course of the last three weeks [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=99.5s)]
*  There is a significant segment in the Democrat Party that said it's okay that Joe Biden was not in control because as long as there was [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=101.74000000000001s)]
*  A cabinet there keeping Trump out and going to do the opposite of whatever Trump would do. That's okay [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=110.24s)]
*  Democracy be damned. And so I think that ultimately at the end of the day is the point of this article [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=116.67999999999999s)]
*  They don't care necessarily about democracy [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=121.32s)]
*  All they care about is making sure that Trump's policies and Trump himself cannot get a foothold your thoughts. Oh [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=124.3s)]
*  No, you're right about that Todd because again cabinet members are not elected by the people right? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=131.88s)]
*  These are people that are installed just like Kamala Harris [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=138.32s)]
*  They tried to install her Hillary Clinton in essence was installed over Bernie Sanders by the DNC when they obviously backed Clinton [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=142.06s)]
*  So yeah, if the people aren't voting for those in power, that's not democracy [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=150.2s)]
*  That's the Pulte Bureau and we don't want the Soviet Union here in the United States that I do know [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  Meets on comedian Bill Maher calling out the left for supporting Hamas. Listen to this [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=160.95999999999998s)]
*  That's what's what's so ironic about liberals being so supportive of [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=166.4s)]
*  Hamas is because your liberals all the protesters who are protesting in Gaza against Hamas [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=171.4s)]
*  They've all been killed [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=178.08s)]
*  I mean do I have to say anything more than just just if it was just that issue how women are treated? Are you? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=179.0s)]
*  Kidding me. I mean, he's got a point Joe [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=186.44s)]
*  He has a lot of good points lately [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=189.94s)]
*  I think it's it's a reminder once again Todd that Bill Maher is increasingly the voice of reason [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=191.94s)]
*  For those on the right on the left and supporting Hamas. That's like supporting al-qaeda. That's like supporting cancer [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=196.94s)]
*  I mean this anti-israel anti-semitic [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=203.94s)]
*  Sediment truly is a cancer within the Democratic Party and it doesn't seem like it's going away anytime soon [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=206.94s)]
*  And this is gonna hurt the Democratic Party like it did on November 5th [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=212.94s)]
*  2024 it will again in 2026 during the midterms and during the 2028 election when we continue to see images like this [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=216.94s)]
*  Hamas flags [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=223.94s)]
*  The killing of those that poor couple down in Washington DC last week of the Israeli embassy and then representative [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=225.94s)]
*  Elon Omar doesn't even condemn it for a very long time. I'm sorry [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=232.94s)]
*  This is something that's a real problem [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=236.94s)]
*  And I don't understand where it comes from because there's no logic in it [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=238.94s)]
*  But here we are there are some though Joe in the Democratic Party who want to go back to the old ways [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=243.94s)]
*  You know where you didn't support a terror organization one of them former Chicago mayor and Democrat operative Rahm Emanuel [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=250.94s)]
*  He's considering a run for president in 2028 boy [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=256.94s)]
*  It really does seem like he's gonna throw his hat in the ring and he called out his own party during a Wall Street Journal interview [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=259.94s)]
*  He said [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=264.94s)]
*  Trying to accomplish something that seems pretty far-fetched even for him pushes Democrat Party rooted in the identity politics of the left [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=266.94s)]
*  To the center he calls the party's brand toxic and weak and woke a nod to culture war issues [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=273.94s)]
*  He thinks Democrats have become too often fixated on that President Trump has successfully used against them Rahm Emanuel once said quote [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=280.94s)]
*  Never let a crisis go to waste is this his moment to take advantage of this abject crisis in his own party [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=287.94s)]
*  I don't think it is Todd because I remember the another mayor of New York City ran for the Democratic nomination [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=296.94s)]
*  2020 and that was Michael Bloomberg and Bloomberg was an excellent mayor of New York [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=303.94s)]
*  He continued Rudy Giuliani's crime initiatives the clear that city was clean. It was safe [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=309.94s)]
*  It was run like a business and he had three terms as mayor here then he runs for president in 2020 Bloomberg does and [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=314.94s)]
*  Was eviscerated by the left and was out quite quickly despite spending a lot of money and by the way Rahm Emanuel [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=320.94s)]
*  He left his mayor of Chicago with an approval rating of 18% [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=326.94s)]
*  His record in Chicago is what it is [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=331.94s)]
*  And if he's the answer then this party is in serious trouble from a leadership perspective [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=333.94s)]
*  Because when you're pulling at 18% in a blue city like Chicago [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=338.94s)]
*  That record is going to be thrown back in your face in a hurry by those in the center [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=342.94s)]
*  And those that are left are not going to embrace a Rahm Emanuel who will be seen as too moderate and too sane [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=347.94s)]
*  For the AOC's the world who probably also will be seeking the Democratic nomination Todd [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=353.94s)]
*  I think you nailed the point about his time as mayor it did not go as well as Michael Bloomberg or as well as [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=358.94s)]
*  Basically almost any other mayor in America. He also nailed another point during a primary [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=363.94s)]
*  You have a tendency to go to the extremes in order to win the nomination if he's saying he's going to want to go to center [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=368.94s)]
*  You raise a great point it could be AOC that takes the mantle because the Democrat party that's voting in a primary [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=374.94s)]
*  Wants the left they want the left they don't want the center Rahm Emanuel pushing to the center [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=380.94s)]
*  Joe Concha pushing the conversation forward we appreciate it sir thank you [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=385.94s)]
*  Todd good to see you at the Jersey Shore this weekend that was fun [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=389.94s)]
*  Concha and I were hanging love it brother [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=392.94s)]
*  you [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y94iP8tj9lc&t=404.94s)]
