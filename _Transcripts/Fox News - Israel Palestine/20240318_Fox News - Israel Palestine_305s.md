# Schumer is doing Biden's bidding with 'disgraceful' Netanyahu rebuke
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [March 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U)
*  Joining us for more on all of this, Wyoming Senator John Barrasso is a Republican on the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=0.0s)]
*  Foreign Relations Committee. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=3.64s)]
*  It's great to have you here. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=4.64s)]
*  I have to say I was a little shocked that one of your colleagues, but on the Democratic [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=6.48s)]
*  side, Chris Van Hollen, actually said that he doesn't think UNRWA was, that anyone from [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=9.76s)]
*  UNRWA was helping Hamas. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=16.84s)]
*  Watch him here. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=18.12s)]
*  When it comes to UN provided humanitarian assistance, like humanitarian assistance through [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=19.86s)]
*  UNRWA, there's been no evidence of diversion to Hamas. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=24.96s)]
*  He said this very, very clearly. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=29.66s)]
*  I have tried to tell my colleagues who keep coming back from meeting with Netanyahu government [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=31.26s)]
*  officials spreading this lie, this myth about diversion from UNRWA. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=35.82s)]
*  Now, there may be diversion to other places, but not from UNRWA. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=41.1s)]
*  This was a surprise to me because I didn't think that there was anybody who disbelieved [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=44.34s)]
*  what we have been hearing about UNRWA for months. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=48.260000000000005s)]
*  And that's the UN relief fund that money has been going to them from years to Hamas. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=51.260000000000005s)]
*  This is money, they have blood on their hands. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=58.019999999999996s)]
*  There's no question and not a single dime should go to them into the future. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=60.26s)]
*  The United Nations has failed in its mission and we've seen that now repeatedly. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=64.06s)]
*  This money has gone to build the tunnels and the terror network that we have with Hamas. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=69.1s)]
*  You just showed the video of all of those tunnels, hundreds and hundreds of miles of [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=74.62s)]
*  tunnels more than the New York subway system. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=78.22s)]
*  Where'd the money come from? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=80.58s)]
*  The United States, United Nations funneling it to this organization. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=81.58s)]
*  Not a single penny should go to them, period. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=85.58s)]
*  It appears the pressure on this administration just continues to ramp up, and I think we [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=88.5s)]
*  see that in some of the protests all over the country. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=92.1s)]
*  But then you've got Chuck Schumer last week calling to get Netanyahu out there, OK, or [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=95.14s)]
*  out of there, I should say. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=99.66s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi was asked about that this weekend here. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=101.18s)]
*  Schumer's speech was an act of courage, an act of love for Israel. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=104.3s)]
*  What is wrong with advocating for elections in a democracy? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=110.22s)]
*  People have different views and they express them and that's a beautiful thing. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=113.94000000000001s)]
*  But for him to say, what does that say if he won't even say that as the war winds [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=117.78s)]
*  down, the people of Israel should speak? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=124.10000000000001s)]
*  That's all Chuck was saying. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=128.5s)]
*  That sound, she says she heard it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=129.5s)]
*  How'd you hear it? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=131.1s)]
*  It was a disgraceful call for interference by the United States into Israel's elections. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=132.1s)]
*  And I thought it was Schumer just doing Biden's bidding. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=138.22s)]
*  I think that we have a president didn't have the guts to do it himself. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=141.06s)]
*  So we had his waterboy, Chuck Schumer, give that speech going after our closest ally in [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=143.66s)]
*  the Middle East, somebody that's been a friend from the beginning of Israel to the United [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=148.9s)]
*  States. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=152.38s)]
*  It was wrong. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=153.38s)]
*  And obviously, Republicans stood up and said so. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=154.38s)]
*  Israel is a democracy. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=158.10000000000002s)]
*  They have absolutely every right to hold an election. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=159.10000000000002s)]
*  They have a right to defend themselves. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=161.54000000000002s)]
*  They're going to keep doing that. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=162.74s)]
*  I think the Democrats are really scared right now because what we see is so many of the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=163.98000000000002s)]
*  far left Democrats are supporting Hamas instead of Israel. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=169.3s)]
*  They're afraid it's going to cost Joe Biden the election. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=173.62s)]
*  It is fractured indeed. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=176.22s)]
*  And what Netanyahu said is we're not a banana republic. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=177.22s)]
*  Leave us alone. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=180.10000000000002s)]
*  And it also helped bring the Israelis back together. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=181.10000000000002s)]
*  Just this just in from the White House. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=182.9s)]
*  Apparently Netanyahu and Biden will speak today. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=184.94s)]
*  So we'll get readouts from both sides and see how that goes. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=188.9s)]
*  Meantime, last week we were filled with conversation about TikTok and what should happen. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=191.38000000000002s)]
*  The House passed it in a quite a bipartisan fashion. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=196.06s)]
*  This now goes over to the Senate. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=199.1s)]
*  And then over the weekend, we hear this, that there are rumored bite dance buyers that are [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=200.62s)]
*  putting themselves together. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=204.64s)]
*  We have Steve Mnuchin, might be familiar to everyone, former Treasury Secretary under [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=205.74s)]
*  President Trump. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=209.38s)]
*  We have Kevin O'Leary. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=210.38s)]
*  Of course, you know him. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=211.38s)]
*  Bobby Kotick. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=212.38s)]
*  He's a former Activision CEO. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=213.38s)]
*  And then someone I don't know, Chris Pavlovsky of Rumble. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=214.82s)]
*  So there is a potential buyer. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=217.98s)]
*  Would that be a good solution for everybody so that it's sold off and everybody gets to [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=220.45999999999998s)]
*  keep using the app? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=224.98s)]
*  I think it would be a good solution. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=225.98s)]
*  Right now, TikTok to me is a national security threat. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=227.46s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=230.22s)]
*  Because it's under the control of the Chinese Communist Party. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=231.22s)]
*  That's the threat component of it when we have 170 million Americans whose information [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=234.1s)]
*  is that under that same control. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=238.7s)]
*  So they can use it to spy on us. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=241.06s)]
*  You know how people get very mad when we hear of a spy balloon going overhead or from us [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=242.78s)]
*  in the West where you see that China is buying farmland, ranch land near military installations? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=247.42s)]
*  This is much, much worse in terms of what they're trying to do. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=253.76s)]
*  I met with the CEO of TikTok last week. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=255.98s)]
*  He was in Washington. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=258.09999999999997s)]
*  And I said, look, the problem is not TikTok itself. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=259.42s)]
*  It's the problem of the ownership. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=262.98s)]
*  And if we can find a group like we have here, I think it would make the solution better. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=264.26s)]
*  Continue with TikTok, but not controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=268.53999999999996s)]
*  We'll see how that goes. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=271.62s)]
*  Senator, thank you for being here. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=272.62s)]
*  It's nice to see you in person. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=273.62s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=274.62s)]
*  Great to see you again. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=275.62s)]
*  And both of us want to express to you our profound gratitude for the loss of your, our [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=276.62s)]
*  profound sorrow, I should say, for the loss of your wife, Bobby. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=280.74s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=283.14s)]
*  Thanks for the advantage. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=284.14s)]
*  Right up till the end. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=285.3s)]
*  She love you guys. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=286.3s)]
*  Thank you, Senator. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=287.3s)]
*  You had a wonderful love story and a great example for the rest of us. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=288.3s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=291.82s)]
*  Stay strong. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=292.82s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNFsc5HKl1U&t=293.82s)]
