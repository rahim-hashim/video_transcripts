# GOP rep exposes the ‘big picture’ impact of US’s strike on Iraq
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [February 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQKK_sYtJg)
*  Congressman Mike Walz of Florida joins us right now House Armed Services Committee, House Foreign [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQKK_sYtJg&t=0.0s)]
*  Affairs Committee, House Intelligence Committee, a genuine war hero and a key player in all of this. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQKK_sYtJg&t=4.24s)]
*  Congressman, picking up on something the general was mentioning here, are ruling out attacks inside [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQKK_sYtJg&t=9.52s)]
*  Iran and telling them that outright. What do you make of that? Well I agree with the general, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQKK_sYtJg&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  I completely disagree with it. You should never take options off the table when you're dealing [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQKK_sYtJg&t=22.64s)]
*  with an adversary like Iran. It reminds me in the lead up to the invasion of Ukraine. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQKK_sYtJg&t=29.92s)]
*  The administration did the same thing in terms of telling Putin what we were not going to do, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQKK_sYtJg&t=36.8s)]
*  and therefore he interprets that as the space that he has therefore to push. But I think also [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQKK_sYtJg&t=43.040000000000006s)]
*  to General Keene's point, it is yet another step in a completely failed Iran policy. And that's the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQKK_sYtJg&t=50.56s)]
*  big picture here that I'm praying and literally I agree with him. We want this to be successful, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQKK_sYtJg&t=57.6s)]
*  that we have to completely rethink the Iran policy, but unfortunately the people enacting Biden's [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQKK_sYtJg&t=65.76s)]
*  policy, namely Jake Sullivan and Blinken, were the same ones that put Obama's policy in place. So they [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQKK_sYtJg&t=70.88s)]
*  still seem to fundamentally believe that you can engage, appease, get at the table and concede [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQKK_sYtJg&t=78.64s)]
*  your way to stability with Iran. And I pray at some point before anyone else dies that they'll [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQKK_sYtJg&t=87.76s)]
*  see the folly in that. But what we're hearing so far, and again we need more information, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQKK_sYtJg&t=95.2s)]
*  is that the Iraqi government was warned, which is increasingly in bed with Iran, that perhaps there's [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQKK_sYtJg&t=99.92s)]
*  reporting out there that the Iranian government was warned through our intermediary, the Swiss [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQKK_sYtJg&t=106.16s)]
*  government, and that if you listen to reporters that are out on the ground, and including the BBC, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQKK_sYtJg&t=112.16s)]
*  that the entire region knew this was coming and that many of those facilities were evacuated. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQKK_sYtJg&t=118.64s)]
*  So if you have more volume, more aircraft, more bombs, more military activity, chasing a flawed [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQKK_sYtJg&t=124.4s)]
*  strategy, which is to limit your attacks to proxies, and we know that Tehran will trade the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQKK_sYtJg&t=132.32000000000002s)]
*  lives of what they see as expendable proxies for American and Israeli lives as part of their [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQKK_sYtJg&t=139.12s)]
*  strategy, which they've been doing for 20 years, then I'm very skeptical this is going to be [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQKK_sYtJg&t=145.36s)]
*  successful in restoring deterrence. Congressman, thank you very much. We have a busy show and [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQKK_sYtJg&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  breaking news here. Mike Waltz of Florida, very good seeing you. Thank you for your service, sir. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQKK_sYtJg&t=156.4s)]
