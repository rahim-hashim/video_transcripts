# Biden speaks after Israel, Hamas reach hostage deal
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU)
*  More than 15 months of terror for the hostages, their families, the Israeli people, more than [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=0.0s)]
*  15 months of suffering by the innocent people of Gaza, fighting in Gaza will stop and soon [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=7.26s)]
*  the hostages will return home to their families. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=15.96s)]
*  The elements of this deal are what I laid out in detail this past May, which was embraced [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=19.5s)]
*  by countries around the world and endorsed overwhelmingly by the UN Security Council. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=26.2s)]
*  The deal is structured in three phases. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=33.76s)]
*  Phase one will last six weeks. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=37.44s)]
*  It includes a full and complete ceasefire, withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=39.92s)]
*  populated areas of Gaza, and the release of a number of hostages held by Hamas, including [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=45.239999999999995s)]
*  women and elderly and the wounded. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  And I'm proud to say Americans will be part of that hostage release in phase one as well. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=55.839999999999996s)]
*  And the Vice President and I cannot wait to welcome them home. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=61.16s)]
*  In exchange, Israel will release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=66.16s)]
*  And during phase one, the Palestinians can also return to their neighborhoods in all [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=70.28s)]
*  the areas of Gaza. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=75.32s)]
*  And the surge of humanitarian assistance into Gaza will begin. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=77.16s)]
*  And the innocent people can have a greater access to these vital supplies. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=81.24s)]
*  You know, during the next six weeks, Israel will negotiate the necessary arrangements [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=87.39999999999999s)]
*  to get phase two, which is a permanent end of the war. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=92.72s)]
*  Let me say it again, a permanent end of the war. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=96.91999999999999s)]
*  There are a number of details to negotiate to move from phase one to phase two. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=99.47999999999999s)]
*  The plan says if negotiations take longer than six weeks, the ceasefire will continue [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=106.32s)]
*  as long as the negotiations continue. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=113.16s)]
*  I've spoken to the mayor of Kuwait and the president of Egypt. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=116.6s)]
*  And we have pledged to make sure the negotiations will keep moving forward for as long as it takes. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=121.4s)]
*  Then, when phase two begins, there will be an exchange for release of the remaining living [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=128.6s)]
*  hostages, including male soldiers. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=135.52s)]
*  And all remaining Israeli forces will be withdrawn from Gaza. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=138.16s)]
*  And the temporary ceasefire will become permanent. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=142.24s)]
*  And finally, phase three, any final remains of hostages who have been killed will be returned [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=146.4s)]
*  to their families. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=153.44s)]
*  And a major reconstruction plan for Gaza will begin. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=155.36s)]
*  This, this is the ceasefire agreement I introduced last spring. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  Today, Hamas and Israel have agreed to that ceasefire agreement and the whole ending of the war. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=164.88000000000002s)]
*  You know, those of you who have followed the negotiations can attest the road to this deal [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=173.12s)]
*  has not been easy. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=177.8s)]
*  I've worked in foreign policy for decades. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=179.76000000000002s)]
*  This is one of the toughest negotiations I've ever experienced. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=182.64s)]
*  And we've reached this point because, because of the pressure that Israel built on Hamas, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=186.16s)]
*  backed by the United States. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=191.83999999999997s)]
*  Hamas's longtime leader, Sinwar, was killed. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=194.16s)]
*  Hamas's strongest supporter, Iran, launched attacks on Israel. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=198.0s)]
*  And those attacks failed after my administration organized a coalition of nations to stop them. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=202.92s)]
*  And after I ordered the US ships and planes to come to Israel's defense, we also shaped [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=209.04000000000002s)]
*  Israel's strong and calibrated response, destroying Iran's air defenses, but avoiding an eschatory [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  cycle of an all-out war. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=221.52s)]
*  The United States also organized a coalition of 20 countries to stand up to attacks by [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=225.08s)]
*  the Houthis, including their missile attacks in Israel. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=230.0s)]
*  Then Hezbollah, another of Hamas's strongest backers, was significantly weakened on the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=234.64s)]
*  battlefield. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  And its leadership was destroyed with our support. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=242.35999999999999s)]
*  Israel negotiated a ceasefire with them. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=246.79999999999998s)]
*  And after that, Lebanon finally elected a new president who's not, who's not beholden [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=250.0s)]
*  Hezbollah. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=255.76s)]
*  And he can begin a new chapter for the Lebanese people. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=256.76s)]
*  We're all told these developments in the region, which the United States helped to [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=261.44s)]
*  shape, changed the equation. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=265.16s)]
*  And so now the terror network that once protected and sustained Hamas is far weaker. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=268.12s)]
*  Iran is weaker. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=273.84s)]
*  Iran is weaker than it's been in decades. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=276.04s)]
*  Hezbollah is badly degraded. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=278.72s)]
*  And after more than 15 months of war, Hamas's senior leaders are dead. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=281.12s)]
*  Thousands of Hamas fighters are dead. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=286.2s)]
*  And the military formations have been destroyed. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=288.96s)]
*  With nowhere to turn, Hamas finally agreed to releasing hostages. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=292.85999999999996s)]
*  You know, there was no other way for this war to end than with a hostage deal. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=298.88s)]
*  And I'm deeply satisfied. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=305.44s)]
*  This day has come, finally come, for the sake of the people of Israel and the families waiting [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=307.71999999999997s)]
*  in agony. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=313.4s)]
*  For the sake of the innocent people in Gaza who suffered unimaginable devastation because [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=315.08s)]
*  of the war. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=320.15999999999997s)]
*  The Palestinian people have gone through hell. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=321.15999999999997s)]
*  Too many innocent people have died. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=325.4s)]
*  Too many communities have been destroyed. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=327.88s)]
*  In this deal, the people of Gaza can finally recover and rebuild. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=330.47999999999996s)]
*  They can look to a future without Hamas in power. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=336.08s)]
*  You know, the Bible says, blessed are the peacemakers. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=339.15999999999997s)]
*  Many peacemakers helped make this deal happen, including an extraordinary team of American [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=343.84s)]
*  diplomats who have worked nonstop for months to get this done. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=349.64s)]
*  Secretary Blinken led the effort. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=355.64s)]
*  Secretary Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser Jake Sullivan, Bill Burns, John Fienn, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=358.2s)]
*  Brett McGurk, Amos Hoxton, and the vice president worked relentlessly as we worked to deliver [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=364.03999999999996s)]
*  this deal. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=370.35999999999996s)]
*  I'd also note this deal was developed and negotiated under my administration, but its [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=372.48s)]
*  terms will be implemented, for the most part, by the next administration. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=379.08s)]
*  In these past few days, we've been speaking as one team. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=383.40000000000003s)]
*  This has been time of real turmoil in the Middle East. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=389.04s)]
*  But as I prepare to leave office, our friends are strong, our enemies are weak, and there's [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=392.44s)]
*  a genuine opportunity for a new future. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=398.76000000000005s)]
*  In Lebanon, there's an opportunity for a future free from the grip of Hezbollah. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=401.84000000000003s)]
*  In Syria, a future free from the tyranny of Assad. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=407.52000000000004s)]
*  And for the Palestinian people, a credible, credible pathway to a state of their own. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=411.32000000000005s)]
*  And for the region, a future of normalization and integration of Israel and all its Arab [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=417.28000000000003s)]
*  neighbors, including Saudi Arabia. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=423.76000000000005s)]
*  At the G20 in Delhi in September 23, I rallied key countries behind the vision of an economic [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=427.24s)]
*  corridor from India across the Middle East to Europe. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=433.44s)]
*  That vision can now become a reality. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=438.04s)]
*  There are risks as well, including ISIS and Iran, even in a badly weakened state. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=439.88s)]
*  But, but, we're handing off to the next team a real opportunity for a better future for [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=445.96000000000004s)]
*  the Middle East. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=452.04s)]
*  I hope they will take it. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=453.40000000000003s)]
*  Let me close with this. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=454.96000000000004s)]
*  My friend for years in the United States Senate, former Senator George Mitchell, who did so [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=457.8s)]
*  much to forge peace in Northern Ireland once said about diplomacy, he said, it is a 700 [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=462.6s)]
*  days of failure and one day of success. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=468.96000000000004s)]
*  700 days of failure and one day of success. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=472.88000000000005s)]
*  Well, we've had many difficult days since the mosque began its terrible war. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=475.8s)]
*  We've encountered roadblocks and setbacks. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=479.92s)]
*  We've not given up. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=483.15999999999997s)]
*  And now, after more than 40, 400 days of struggle, a day of success has arrived. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=485.2s)]
*  God bless all the hostages and their families. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=491.92s)]
*  May God protect the troops of all those who work for peace. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=494.52s)]
*  Mr. President, how do you see the future of Gaza now? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=500.2s)]
*  As you were saying, the implementation of this deal will be in the hands of the next [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=503.4s)]
*  administration and basically they will shape the future of Gaza. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=507.08s)]
*  So how do you see this future? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=511.24s)]
*  And also, how much credit do you give to the Trump team for this deal? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=513.4s)]
*  Trump is already taking credit for this. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=517.72s)]
*  Well, you know, this is the exact framework of the deal I proposed back in May. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=520.76s)]
*  Exact. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=527.32s)]
*  And we got the world to endorse it. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=528.92s)]

*  backers and create the conditions for this deal. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=539.96s)]
*  And thirdly, I knew this deal would have to be implemented by the next team. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=545.24s)]
*  So I told my team to coordinate closely with the incoming team to make sure we're all speaking [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=550.68s)]
*  with the same voice because that's what American presidents do. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=557.72s)]
*  Mr. President, how many Americans will be released when the hostages are being [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=561.08s)]
*  released? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=570.04s)]
*  All the exact detail of how many people are being held, how many bodies will be returned, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=571.32s)]

*  All of it. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=579.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=580.2s)]

*  Thank you. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=586.52s)]
*  Who is the books credit for this, Mr. President, you or Trump? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=586.84s)]
*  Is that a joke? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=591.56s)]
*  Oh, thank you. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRM_RFKW1AU&t=593.08s)]
