# GOP sen warns of potential ‘mass casualty attack’ against US troops
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0)
*  We're joined now by Arkansas Republican Senator Tom Cotton, member of the Armed Services Committee. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=0.0s)]
*  Great to have you back on Fox News Sunday. Thank you, Shannon. Good to be back with you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=4.4s)]
*  So let's start with this pause because there are folks who don't think it's been the best idea. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=7.68s)]
*  Wall Street Journal, an opinion piece over there says, a ceasefire deprives Israel of military [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  momentum and transfers the initiative to Hamas. Now that Israel has agreed to a short ceasefire, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=16.32s)]
*  the Biden administration and its Qatari interlocutors will expect longer ceasefires. Hamas [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=22.0s)]
*  will remain armed and dangerous in Gaza and will use this ceasefire to regroup. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=27.6s)]
*  But we have gotten dozens of hostages out. What do you make of it? Where do we go from here? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  Well, I don't want to second guess the Israeli government. They had near unanimous support [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=36.08s)]
*  across many different political parties and in their senior security leadership that this was [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  the appropriate step to take. So I'm not going to second guess the Israeli government, but I have [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=45.2s)]
*  to say it seems like President Biden puts more pressure on Israel than he does on Hamas and its [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  hosts in Qatar. Part of the reasons why we got to this point where we had to have a four day pause [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=54.32s)]
*  is the Biden administration has consistently behind the scenes insisted that Israel's [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=60.88s)]
*  government take steps that are clearly not in Israel's interest. For instance, providing [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=65.36s)]
*  fuel into Gaza, not just water or food or medicine, but fuel, which may as well be providing them with [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=69.44s)]
*  ammunition. I'm also very frustrated that we have not seen the release of a single American hostage. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=75.76s)]
*  Perhaps there'll be one today, but apparently Hamas is so contemptuous of President Biden and [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=81.44s)]
*  American power that they feel the imperative to release Filipinos and Thai hostages before [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=87.36s)]
*  they release American hostages. That's just one small example of the weakness that President Biden [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=93.2s)]
*  has projected around the world that has resulted in things like Americans being taken hostage or [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=98.8s)]
*  Iran attacking Americans more than 70 times now since or over the last month or the fall of Kabul [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=103.6s)]
*  in 2021. So to the point about Americans still being held there, Democratic Congressman Dean [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=110.08s)]
*  Phillips, by the way, mounting a run against President Biden in the primary lane with Democrats, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=114.48s)]
*  he says he thinks we should be using U.S. forces on the ground potentially to get those Americans [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=118.56s)]
*  out. Here's what he says. By now I would have expected American special forces to perhaps play [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=122.72s)]
*  a hand in extracting them. I think it's absurd, shocking and dismaying that six weeks later we [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  still have American hostages held by a terror organization in Gaza. I'm happy for the Israelis, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=134.56s)]
*  don't get me wrong. Hamas should release all hostages, but the fact that we have Americans [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=140.48s)]
*  sitting in Gaza right now held hostage is appalling and should be addressed immediately. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=145.76s)]
*  You have served in uniform overseas. What do you make about this call for using U.S. special forces [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=150.56s)]
*  to get our folks out? Well, we should certainly be open to that. I mean, we have elite special [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=154.64000000000001s)]
*  operations forces who are specifically trained in hostage rescue. I do think we have to [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=159.04s)]
*  be deferential to the Israeli government and the Israeli defense forces about the tactical [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=164.24s)]
*  situation on the ground. But if American military forces are called upon and can provide a viable [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=169.52s)]
*  solution to get out American citizens and the citizens of Israel or other nations, then we have [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=175.84s)]
*  to be open to that. But again, it's not just those small special operations units that we have trained. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=180.4s)]
*  We have two aircraft carriers in the region. We've increased the number of troops and aircraft we [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  have in the region. Yet Hamas is still so contemptuous of President Biden that it hasn't [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=190.72s)]
*  yet released American hostages. This would have never happened under Donald Trump or Ronald Reagan. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=195.2s)]
*  In fact, if you recall, Jimmy Carter had a hostage crisis with Iran, Hamas's patron, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=199.6s)]
*  for over 400 days. Iran released those hostages the day Ronald Reagan took office because they [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=204.4s)]
*  were so scared of what Ronald Reagan might do to them. You don't see that kind of fear of President [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=209.6s)]
*  Biden from Hamas or Iran or frankly anyone around the world. But you talk about our assets in the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=214.32s)]
*  region. We talk about our troops in uniform in the region. How worried are you about that expanding [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=218.8s)]
*  into something broader that we get drawn into? Because I don't think the American people have [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=223.76000000000002s)]
*  a taste for that. Well, unfortunately, Shannon, it's already expanded. Since Joe Biden took office, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=226.88000000000002s)]
*  Iran has attacked American positions in the Middle East, I think now over 150 times. And just in the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=231.12s)]
*  last month, it's over 70 times. We've only hit back a few times. When we do hit back, it's almost [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=236.32000000000002s)]
*  always at empty proxy warehouses or maybe proxy forces in Iraq and Syria. It seems like the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=241.52s)]
*  president wants to go out of his way to avoid Iranian casualties. But what targets would you [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=247.68s)]
*  suggest? I would target Iranians who are operating in Iraq and in Syria. I would also send a clear [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=252.64000000000001s)]
*  message to Iran if these attacks don't stop immediately, then we'll begin to threaten their [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=259.28000000000003s)]
*  assets, like Ronald Reagan when he sank half of Iran's navy for attacking a U.S. Navy ship. Look, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=264.16s)]
*  the president keeps talking about fear of escalation. Fear of escalation ensures escalation. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=269.84000000000003s)]
*  The way to stop it is to establish escalation dominance over a terror-supporting regime like [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=274.96s)]
*  Iran. You know, Sean Connery's character, Jim Malone in The Untouchables, said to Kevin Costner's [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=280.08s)]
*  character, Elliot Ness, about how to handle the Chicago mob. If they send one of yours to the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=285.59999999999997s)]
*  hospital, you send one of theirs to the morgue. That's not just the Chicago way. That's the way [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=289.84s)]
*  of the Middle East. And President Biden doesn't appear to understand that. But do we get drawn [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=294.64s)]
*  into something akin to World War III? Is that what Hamas wanted all along? I mean, clearly, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=298.4s)]
*  they didn't want Israel to achieve some of these peace talks that they were having that the U.S. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=302.24s)]
*  was involved in as well. But to get militarily involved, kinetically involved with their land [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=305.52s)]
*  mass is a different situation. That's another level. No, Shannon, like what Ronald Reagan did [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=312.88s)]
*  when he sank half of Iran's navy, it didn't lead to an open, outright war. In fact, it ended the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=318.72s)]
*  Iran-Iraq war, which had been waging for more than eight years because Iran was so scared of [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=324.40000000000003s)]
*  Ronald Reagan. After Donald Trump directed the killing of Qasem Soleimani in Iraq, Iran's terrorist [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=328.0s)]
*  mastermind, Iran pulled in its horns for the rest of the Trump era. The way to stop these attacks [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=333.28s)]
*  is not to be fearful and hesitant and cautious in a response, but massive retaliation to make it [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=338.88s)]
*  clear we will not tolerate these attacks on Americans. Otherwise, I fear we're going to see [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=344.56s)]
*  a mass casualty attack against American forces in the region. Well, you know that there is a [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=348.56s)]
*  strong sentiment in that region that is blaming the U.S. as well, pointing fingers at us. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=353.44s)]
*  Washington Post says this. Political analysts in the Middle East called Washington's support for [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=356.96s)]
*  Israel's war a reckless position that doesn't account for the long-term diplomatic security [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=361.03999999999996s)]
*  and economic effects of alienating a region where rivals, namely China, which you and I have talked [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=366.47999999999996s)]
*  about many times, are carving deeper inroads. More importantly, they said the war has toppled [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=370.56s)]
*  the United States from its moral high ground. So do you worry about the longer-term impacts of [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=375.28s)]
*  alienating many in the Arab world, especially the younger generation who clearly does not think the [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=379.91999999999996s)]
*  U.S. is on the right side of this conflict? Life in the Middle East is not a church picnic. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=385.52s)]
*  What you need more than anything is iron will and crushing force. And what I fear most threatens [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=390.15999999999997s)]
*  American interest and stability in the region is American weakness. Arab leaders want to be [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=396.24s)]
*  partners with a strong America and frankly with a strong Israel because the thing they fear most [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=401.59999999999997s)]
*  is Iran and its terror proxies, like its paramilitary groups in Iraq and Syria or Hamas or Hezbollah [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=406.4s)]
*  or the Houthi rebels in Yemen, which President Biden took off the terror [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=412.96s)]
*  terrorist list in his early days in office. That kind of weakness and the weakness we've [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=416.79999999999995s)]
*  seen towards Iran is what's going to imperil American interest and lives in the region, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=421.12s)]
*  not being hesitant or cautious or showing restraint in the face of attacks on American troops and [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=426.0s)]
*  citizens in the region and this massacre of Israelis on October 7th. You got a lot ahead [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=432.47999999999996s)]
*  of you as you come back from this break. Funding fights over Ukraine, Israel, the border, all of [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=438.24s)]
*  that. What are your hopes that that comes together? Well, for the last two years, President Biden has [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=443.04s)]
*  showed that he seems to care more about Ukraine's borders than he cares about America's borders. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=447.6s)]
*  We Republicans care about both. We want to secure our border. We want to stop the flow [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=451.36s)]
*  of illegal immigrants in this country and the crime and the drugs and the potential terrorism [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=455.92s)]
*  it could open this country up to. At the same time, we want to help Ukraine resist Russia's [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=460.24s)]
*  war of unprovoked aggression. So in return for providing additional funding for Ukraine, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=465.6s)]
*  we have to have significant and substantial reforms to our border policy, specifically [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=470.8s)]
*  asylum and parole, the processes that are being abused at our border for millions of [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=476.08000000000004s)]
*  illegal migrants to come to this country over the last three years. We'll talk to our next guest [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=480.72s)]
*  too to see if he thinks you guys can make any bipartisan progress on that. Senator, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=484.48s)]
*  thank you for coming in. Thank you. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=487.68s)]
*  Hottest interviews and most compelling analysis. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrmRpeotfE0&t=495.6s)]
