# Trump hostage envoy defends US-Hamas direct talks: ‘Israel is a strong ally’
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [March 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g)
*  Joining us now special presidential envoy for hostage affairs Adam Buller welcome to Fox News Sunday [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=0.0s)]
*  Thanks for having want to start here with a report a reporter out of Channel 12 in Israel citing an Israeli source says that US [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=6.3s)]
*  Hamas talks over hostages quote have failed fact or fiction. Where can you give us an update this morning? I [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=13.98s)]
*  Actually think they were very productive talks [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=21.18s)]
*  They identified some opportunity to come together because we're always asking [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=23.7s)]
*  Israel Hamas, how's it gonna win? What does it look afterward? And I think they provided some very interesting views there in the discussions [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=29.16s)]
*  Interesting views that can lead you to a release or an impasse [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=37.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean really my goal is to release prisoners or if I focused on our alive American [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=42.36s)]
*  Adi Alexander and our four dead Americans getting them home as soon as possible [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=48.44s)]
*  And how important that was to the president to President Trump [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=53.32s)]
*  But we also discussed what the end might look like and I will tell you that Hamas did orient toward a long-term [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=56.32s)]
*  Truce as they called it a truce where they would be disarmed a truth where they choose where they would not be part of the political [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  Policy and a truce where we would ensure [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=72.04s)]
*  That they are in a place where they can't hurt Israel part of that was rebuilding Gaza [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=75.72s)]
*  But the discussions [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=80.44s)]
*  Revolved around a few things that I think might actually end up being some of what you see post Steve what cough [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=83.0s)]
*  How difficult is it to sit down with the leaders of an organization that torture that murder people? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=89.8s)]
*  I mean the most recent example that has grabbed hearts and minds are the children the bebis children four years old nine months old [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=96.3s)]
*  Do you worry that having direct conversations with them gives this group any kind of veneer of respectability or legitimacy on the world stage? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=102.28s)]
*  First and foremost it is hard. I listen to the family's stories. I hug the families when we bring them home [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=110.8s)]
*  Which is unbelievable and I know exactly what happened [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=117.32s)]
*  So you walk into there and you kind of have to block it out emotionally because I'm gonna know auspices as much as someone might smile [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=120.67999999999999s)]
*  Or give me a coffee as we talk that doesn't mean that they didn't do what they do [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=128.04s)]
*  My belief then is dialogue is very important. I think I follow the president United States [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=132.96s)]
*  Everybody said he couldn't go to North Korea. He sits with North Korea. You have real discussions [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  Dialogue does not mean giving things dialogue doesn't mean giving millions or billions of dollars like the prior administration did [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=143.56s)]
*  Dialogue lit means sitting hearing what someone wants and then identifying does it fit with what we want or not? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=151.32s)]
*  And then how can you get somewhere in the middle and not have a war and I think those kind of dialogues are very important [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=158.36s)]
*  Because as he constantly says he doesn't want war [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=164.60000000000002s)]
*  War is a last resort. He wants a peaceful world [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=168.96s)]
*  And so what I'm trying to do is say one how can I get our hostages out as soon as possible? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  I feel every single day when they're not out and then how do you create the circumstances to stop this war? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=179.0s)]
*  So obviously there's a lot of widespread reporting that Israel did not like this idea of the US having direct talks with Hamas [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=184.76000000000002s)]
*  That they in fact found out once it was already underway or it had happened [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=192.0s)]
*  You got a call from Ron Dermer the head of their strategic affairs [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  It was described as a very heated phone call only you can tell us what actually happened on that call [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  Why did the US move ahead with these direct talks knowing Israel had objections and where would you say the relationship is now? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=205.68s)]
*  post the Dermot phone call I [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=211.36s)]
*  Would say that the Israelis were kept informed [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=214.28000000000003s)]
*  I did have a discussion with Ron Ron wait raised some concerns and quite frankly [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=217.84s)]
*  It's totally fair for Israel to have concerns if we're having direct [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=222.39999999999998s)]
*  Contacts with Hamas for all he knows he doesn't know me. Maybe I would meet them and say oh they seem like such nice guys [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=226.35999999999999s)]
*  You know, let's have beer and chips with them [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=231.28s)]
*  So I think there was concern. I think I was able to put him at ease [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=233.95999999999998s)]
*  That I wasn't going to go off the rails that it would be parameters that we would work on together [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=239.51999999999998s)]
*  So I thought I thought that stuff was natural and there's no question in my mind that our greatest ally is Israel [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=244.8s)]
*  So times of Israel says one of Israel's opposition points to the direct talks was it's concerned that the US might lose interest in securing [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=251.12s)]
*  A broad hostage ceasefire deal once all American hostages are released. Can you speak to that concern? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=258.48s)]
*  Is that something you discussed with mr. Dermer? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=264.32s)]
*  Of course. Well, let me tell you something not that but I discussed that with the president and the president has been very clear [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=267.32s)]
*  That is all hostages [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=273.76s)]
*  And so I will say when you think about my job [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  My job is to get all hostages home there because the job was given to me by the president and take my orders from the president [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=278.56s)]
*  United States and so he's been very clear and if you think about the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=285.56s)]
*  American that was there and the bodies that are there that was a pretense to bring everybody home [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=289.72s)]
*  It wasn't a one-off where then United States we care way too much about the region [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=295.88s)]
*  If you see the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=301.32s)]
*  Survivors that went and saw the president in the Oval Office that was a group of Americans, but a group of full Israelis [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=303.08s)]
*  So we have made that commitment Israel is a strong ally if someone wants to take hostage at Israel [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=310.68s)]
*  We feel it too. So the president put up a stark warning on social media with regard to Hamas and getting the hostages out [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=316.68s)]
*  He said turn them over or it's immediately over for you [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  He says a beautiful future awaits, but if you don't turn over the hostages you are dead [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=326.72s)]
*  Release the hostages now or there will be hell to pay later. What's the deadline and what's the hell to pay? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=331.24s)]
*  You know, he didn't set a deadline but let me just look at what he's what he's done to be for I remember actually [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=337.92s)]
*  Two to a week ago. I was in Baghdad and there's a little mark of the spot [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=343.44s)]
*  Right where al-salam a nice car with an Iraqi in it right where it was hit by two missiles [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=348.92s)]
*  And there's a little spot we all got out to look at it [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=356.0s)]
*  And I remember the day he did it I actually happen to be the West Wing but it was surprising no one else [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=359.66s)]
*  No one else would do it because they were afraid and this is what I will say [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=365.46s)]
*  It may seem like he makes empty threats until he carries out the threat and then it's not so empty and then you're dead [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=369.24s)]
*  And so I think in these situations and he's done the same thing with Iran [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=376.78s)]
*  He's that you they are walking the line on Iran because it's not so hard for us to partner with Israel and take out [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=381.38s)]
*  That nuclear capability which probably should do well several examples as you note the president's action come to mind Adam Buller [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=389.18s)]
*  Thank you for your time. Just know the prayers of folks around the world are with you in this work. Thank you [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=396.46s)]
*  Thank you so much [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leiKyEgS26g&t=401.78000000000003s)]
