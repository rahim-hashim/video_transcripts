# New details revealed surrounding FBI Director Wray's secret trip to Israel
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [February 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiU5bmDATKE)
*  The Washington Post now reporting that the framework for a peace deal between Israel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiU5bmDATKE&t=0.0s)]
*  and the Palestinians could be coming soon and it would recognize a Palestinian state. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiU5bmDATKE&t=5.7s)]
*  This as Fox News catches up with FBI Director Christopher Wray during his surprise visit [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiU5bmDATKE&t=11.94s)]
*  to Israel. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiU5bmDATKE&t=17.14s)]
*  Trey Yanks is live in Tel Aviv with us. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiU5bmDATKE&t=18.42s)]
*  Hey Carly, good morning. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiU5bmDATKE&t=20.580000000000002s)]
*  We are learning more about a secret trip that FBI Director Christopher Wray made to Israel [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiU5bmDATKE&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiU5bmDATKE&t=29.240000000000002s)]
*  Now this was his first visit to the Jewish state since the war began in October. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiU5bmDATKE&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  He reportedly met with officials from the Mossad and the Shin Bet, Israel's intelligence [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiU5bmDATKE&t=34.9s)]
*  agencies. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiU5bmDATKE&t=39.160000000000004s)]
*  He also spoke with FBI agents on the ground who are currently working to counter global [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiU5bmDATKE&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  terror threats. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiU5bmDATKE&t=44.42s)]
*  Fox's David Spunt spoke with Wray over the phone in an exclusive interview about his [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiU5bmDATKE&t=45.42s)]
*  visit to Israel. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiU5bmDATKE&t=49.72s)]
*  We've seen a really roguish gallery of foreign terrorist organizations both express support [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiU5bmDATKE&t=52.08s)]
*  and praise for the Hamas attacks and threaten to attack U.S. interests at home and abroad. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiU5bmDATKE&t=58.92s)]
*  Wray's trip comes as American officials continue to push for a ceasefire agreement between [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiU5bmDATKE&t=67.92s)]
*  Israel and Hamas as the war enters day 132. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiU5bmDATKE&t=72.36s)]
*  A new report indicates a ceasefire could be tied to a broader peace deal that would lead [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiU5bmDATKE&t=76.84s)]
*  to a Palestinian state. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiU5bmDATKE&t=81.4s)]
*  Given the current government, such a plan would be unlikely to succeed. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiU5bmDATKE&t=83.2s)]
*  Now these developments do come as Vice President Harris just landed at the Munich Security [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiU5bmDATKE&t=87.12s)]
*  Conference. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiU5bmDATKE&t=91.76s)]
*  She will speak there this weekend. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiU5bmDATKE&t=92.76s)]
*  There are going to be a large gathering of officials from around the world and they are [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiU5bmDATKE&t=94.84s)]
*  likely to discuss these developments out of the Middle East. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiU5bmDATKE&t=98.2s)]
*  Carly? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiU5bmDATKE&t=101.16000000000001s)]
*  Okay, Trey Yanks live for us in Tel Aviv. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiU5bmDATKE&t=102.16000000000001s)]
