# Israel-Hamas deal was 'dead' until Trump got involved: Rep. Waltz
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs)
*  Another Fox News alert overnight Israel hitting the pause button on approving that ceasefire deal accusing Hamas of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=0.0s)]
*  Already backtracking on parts of the agreement that they agreed to yesterday [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=7.8s)]
*  So phase one of the deal which is set to begin on Sunday requires Israel release more than [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=12.32s)]
*  100 Palestinian terrorists in exchange for less than 10 innocent Israeli hostages including some Americans [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=18.56s)]
*  So what's going on at the last minute? We're getting very new reports [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=25.76s)]
*  So let's bring president-elect Trump's incoming national security advisor good friend of the show Michael Waltz Michael great to see you [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=28.6s)]
*  Your thoughts about the pause. What could you tell our audiences behind it? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  Well, one of the final pieces in the arrangement is that Prime Minister Netanyahu and his key team [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=41.6s)]
*  You know basically have to run this through their government and get the votes [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=49.28s)]
*  For this deal, so there's some some last-minute kind of maneuvering there's some last-minute shifting [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=53.6s)]
*  They actually have to prevent names on lists and a specific timeline [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  For when those exchanges will be taking place. So that's what's going on right now. We are still very optimistic [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=65.12s)]
*  Everybody wants this deal to happen because essentially those people will die and this deal was stuck [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=74.04s)]
*  Just a month ago [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=82.24s)]
*  until President Trump was elected until he sent Steve Witkoff over and said see what we can get and I want [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=84.67999999999999s)]
*  The people of Israel to be very clear and to hear me loud and clear [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=91.88s)]
*  You're dealing with President Trump who took out Suleimani who took out Baghdadi who fully supports Israel [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  No one has done more for Israel than President Trump [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=103.1s)]
*  We will have their back to make sure Hamas never exists as a terrorist state and certainly [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=106.39999999999999s)]
*  Does not govern Gaza, but congressman they're gonna be late. I mean it's clear that the president-elect's [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=113.16s)]
*  Pressure worked and they are at the negotiation date, but the deal is probably done [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=119.52s)]
*  But they're not gonna have all the hostages released by day one [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  So are you Pete Hexeth and Marco Rubio gonna be summons to the White House for military options then? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=127.64s)]
*  Because they're not gonna be back home yet [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=133.2s)]
*  Well, the deal always was that the hostages will get phased out the exchanges will be phased over time [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=137.08s)]
*  And then we'll see if Hamas upload, you know [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=146.0s)]
*  Upholds their end of the bargain and you know, the message I want to send is that we have Israel's back again [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=149.64000000000001s)]
*  We wouldn't even be in this position [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=156.4s)]
*  But for the strength of BB and Israel to take out Hezbollah, which was going to be the cavalry coming [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=158.16000000000003s)]
*  For Hamas to take out Semua to take out Hania. They are completely isolated. They're completely on their back foot [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=164.6s)]
*  That's why we have any semblance of getting our hostages out [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=171.0s)]
*  That's what I think we need to be focused on is these people coming out hugging their families as [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=174.98s)]
*  President Trump comes in how many phases are there and how long will it take to get through each phase and in the end? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=180.92s)]
*  How many hostages will be released? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=186.56s)]
*  Well, we're talking 42 days and what we're talking about right now [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=189.56s)]
*  And these people are in horrific terrible conditions being abused [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=194.22s)]
*  Right now as we speak, so we're talking 25 alive [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=199.46s)]
*  And a number of remains again. This is a group that holds people's dead bodies as bargaining chips [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=203.1s)]
*  It's sick. It's horrific, but we're looking forward to getting people out alive. It is disgusting [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=210.82s)]
*  You mentioned Steve Witkoff Steve Witkoff is a Donald Trump's negotiator. He's been instrumental [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=215.42s)]
*  And in fact the Qataris the Israelis they have all said that the Trump team actually helped push this toward [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=221.18s)]
*  Some sort of a deal although Joe Biden says he deserves all the credit speaking of Donald Trump [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=228.42000000000002s)]
*  Yesterday it became clear in the Washington Post that it sounds like Donald Trump is trying to throw [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=234.9s)]
*  Tik Tok some sort of a lifeline [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=241.62s)]
*  Could have an executive order to save the platform [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=244.3s)]
*  I know a lot of people don't like it national security concerns, but there are [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=247.95999999999998s)]
*  170 million Americans who use it. So what's gonna happen to it? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=252.51999999999998s)]
*  Well, President Trump and this is in line with the legislation [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=260.47999999999996s)]
*  Well, we will put measures in place to keep tick-tock from going dark in the legislation [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=264.96s)]
*  Allows for an extension as long as a viable deal is on the table [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=271.24s)]
*  And then you know essentially that buys President Trump time [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=275.8s)]
*  To keep tick-tock going. It's been a great platform for him and his campaign to get his [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=280.12s)]
*  America first message out but at the same time he wants to protect their data [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=287.36s)]
*  You know conservatives don't want the FBI and they certainly don't want the Chinese [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=291.82s)]
*  Communists getting their passwords getting their data and being able to overly influence the American people [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=296.92s)]
*  Okay, Congressman or thanks congressman [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4h0GoRkzXs&t=302.40000000000003s)]
