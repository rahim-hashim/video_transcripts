# Hamas is using this cease-fire to re-strategize for another attack: Chad Robichaux
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk)
*  Netanyahu is in between a rock and a hard place here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=0.0s)]
*  He's got to listen to the families. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  He's got to keep the pressure on Hamas, and he's trying to thread the needle here with [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  this exchange. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=11.16s)]
*  We know that Hamas is going to rearm, refit, rest, and try to figure out a new strategy. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=12.32s)]
*  Retired Army Brigadier General Anthony Tata on the dangers of a temporary ceasefire between [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=19.740000000000002s)]
*  Israel and Hamas. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=24.580000000000002s)]
*  That four-day truce now set to begin at 7 a.m. local time. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=25.88s)]
*  It's midnight Eastern time back here in the U.S. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=29.88s)]
*  Israelis are eagerly awaiting to hear whether their family members will be among the 50 [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=33.64s)]
*  hostages Hamas releases. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=39.44s)]
*  Marine Corps veteran and co-founder of Save Our Allies, Chad Robichaux joins me now. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=41.36s)]
*  Chad, happy Thanksgiving. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=46.0s)]
*  Good news for many of those anxious families. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=48.06s)]
*  What do you make of what we're hearing from Qatar's foreign minister there? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=50.84s)]
*  I mean, well, anytime that we're going to have hostages released, that's good news. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=55.56s)]
*  I think what everybody needs to realize, and you guys have reported it well, is this isn't [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=60.28s)]
*  a peace deal to stop the war between Israel and Palestine. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=63.84s)]
*  This is a four-day ceasefire to exchange hostages, 50 Israelis, 150 Palestinians, hopefully more. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=66.72s)]
*  But I'm confident that Hamas is using this as an opportunity to re-strategize. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=74.84s)]
*  I don't think they really care about exchanging hostages. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=83.04s)]
*  They want an opportunity for a pause to re-strategize. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=85.4s)]
*  And Israel can't allow Hamas to call the shots in this negotiation. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=88.0s)]
*  They really don't have any leverage to unless NetYahu gives it to them. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=93.28s)]
*  And you can't let them re-strategize for a second another attack. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  And Chad, here's John Kirby. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=101.08000000000001s)]
*  I want to play for you, somebody of him talking a little bit about the hostages and mentioning [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=103.72s)]
*  that pause. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  Take a listen here. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=109.24000000000001s)]
*  In the next day or so, we'll start to see them be reunited with their families. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=111.36s)]
*  This deal will also allow for a pause in the fighting for something like four days, maybe [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=116.16s)]
*  longer. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=120.28s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=121.28s)]
*  What do you make of that video, Kirby? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=122.28s)]
*  Sort of, I guess, sort of selling to the American people this idea of the pause. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=123.96s)]
*  But as you point out, tactically, from a military standpoint and with the end goal being the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=128.92s)]
*  removal and eradication of Hamas, it makes it very complicated. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=134.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=139.48s)]
*  I mean, look, I've been involved in combat and fighting my whole life. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=140.48s)]
*  And one thing I know about combat is when you have the enemy on their heels, you don't [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=144.48s)]
*  let up and you don't really pressure. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  I mean, they're going to—you want this thing to—war is ugly. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=150.67999999999998s)]
*  No one who's been in war wants war. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=155.79999999999998s)]
*  But if you're going to do it, you do it to win. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=157.32s)]
*  And that's a lesson that I think our administration should learn. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  If you're going to go to war, you go to war to win. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=162.72s)]
*  And any kind of pause in that pressure is not a good thing. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=164.64s)]
*  It's a bad thing. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=168.8s)]
*  It means more lives are going to be taken because of the fact that now you have a force [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=169.8s)]
*  on force of the enemy having a sense of strength and be able to fight back. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=174.96s)]
*  So I don't agree with him. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=178.28s)]
*  I don't agree with Kirby on much, but especially don't agree with him on that. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=179.76000000000002s)]
*  You've got to keep pressure on Hamas to get him back down. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=183.76000000000002s)]
*  And, Chad, we thank you for your service. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=186.32000000000002s)]
*  You talk about U.S. forces. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  The U.S. has not drawn into this, although obviously we have carrier strike groups in [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=190.08s)]
*  the neighborhood. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=194.52s)]
*  One column in the Wall Street Journal caught our eyes here. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=195.68s)]
*  And I'll just put it up for you. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=199.60000000000002s)]
*  The headline is the hostage deal means Israel is fighting the clock. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=201.12s)]
*  Quote here, Israel needs time to root out Hamas. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=205.20000000000002s)]
*  But the longer the war goes on, the likelier it is to spiral into a regional conflict drawing [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=207.70000000000002s)]
*  in the U.S. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=213.88s)]
*  How concerned are you that America gets brought into this? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=215.52s)]
*  Well, I mean, this is why, you know, America, Israel is our greatest ally in the Middle [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=218.84s)]
*  East, and we have to support them. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=224.88s)]
*  But Israel is definitely capable of handling this with the right support. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=227.28s)]
*  And that's why it's important that this isn't drawn out. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=231.28s)]
*  That's why, you know, to have someone like John Kirby saying that, you know, this is [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=233.32s)]
*  a good thing for four days to drag. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=238.08s)]
*  They don't want this thing to drag out. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=239.48000000000002s)]
*  But for some reason, this administration is choosing to let things drag out. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=242.14000000000001s)]
*  Ukraine's a great example. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=247.08s)]
*  Ukraine can be over in a week, two weeks, but they want it to drag out. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=248.48000000000002s)]
*  And if we let this thing drag out in the Middle East, yeah, it could drag the United States [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=253.20000000000002s)]
*  into not just supporting Israel, but into a war. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=258.72s)]
*  And you see it with the, you know, we've seen rockets being shot at U.S. warships. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=261.36s)]
*  Chad, thank you. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=267.32s)]
*  We've got to leave it there. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=268.96000000000004s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=270.12s)]
*  Happy Thanksgiving to you. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-E1Sm9U6zk&t=271.12s)]
