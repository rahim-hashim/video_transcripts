# IDF spokesman: Plans 'already approved' to eradicate Hamas
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ)
*  at Colonel Reserve. Jonathan Konrikos is joining us right now live as this is happening, international [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=0.0s)]
*  spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces. Jonathan Konrikos joining us now. Thank you [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=5.84s)]
*  so much, Sarah. We're watching these hostages getting out of the vans and being transferred. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=10.88s)]
*  Can you tell us more about this process and what you know? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=15.76s)]
*  Yes. Hi. And thank you for having me. I hate to interrupt the general, but we are seeing positive [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=20.64s)]
*  images for the fifth day now. Israeli women and children after 53 days of brutal Hamas captivity [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=28.08s)]
*  are being returned home. Today we're talking about 10 Israeli nationals and two foreign [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=38.0s)]
*  nationals that are being returned, all of them women, no men. As you mentioned before, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=44.959999999999994s)]
*  of the previous four groups of Israelis that have been released, 51 in number, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=51.76s)]
*  not including those of today. We have torn families, women and children that have been [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=56.96s)]
*  returned, fathers who are still in Hamas captivity. So Jonathan, we note that the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=62.32s)]
*  youngest of the hostages that were released today was 17 years old. A lot of the hostages are elderly [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=69.84s)]
*  folks. I believe the mother of one of the hostages, the young hostage, was released today as well. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=75.76s)]
*  But there are so many. If you say that 51 released prior to this, that's a total of 63, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=83.36s)]
*  but Hamas was holding 239. So that still leaves more than 150 hostages in Hamas captivity. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=89.76s)]
*  And one of the big questions is, Hamas seems to be playing this idea of a ceasefire or pause in [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=97.52000000000001s)]
*  military operations, however you want to characterize that, for all it's worth here. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=104.64000000000001s)]
*  And if you've still got 150 people left and you're releasing them at a rate of 10 a day, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=109.68s)]
*  that's another two weeks at least that they could try to hold off military operations by the IDF [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=114.72000000000001s)]
*  in Gaza. Do you expect that that is the way that it's going to go in the days ahead? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=121.68s)]
*  You are very correct in your analysis, I think. And what we're looking at, you know, this current [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=129.44s)]
*  framework has a 10-day limit to it. So we understand what Hamas is doing. If Hamas [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=135.84s)]
*  would be able to do what they wanted, and I'm sure that they would release only one [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=143.84s)]
*  hostage every day, part of the negotiations that went on, a lot of negotiations with very important [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=148.16s)]
*  American input by the president himself and of course his team, we put it at a minimum of at [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=154.8s)]
*  least 10 live hostages per day in order to have another day of pause in our activities. But there [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=161.52s)]
*  is a cap of 10 days for the current framework, and if we want to expand that, then that has to be [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=169.44s)]
*  renegotiated and voted on again by the Israeli war cabinet. So what we're doing in the IDF is, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=176.24s)]
*  of course, facilitating these very important moments, each and every Israeli that is brought [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=182.88s)]
*  home to safety and to be reunified with their family is a beautiful thing, the best thing I've [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=188.56s)]
*  seen in the last 53 days. But we are preparing for the future of operations. Plans are already [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=194.72s)]
*  approved and ready to be executed to continue to fight and to eradicate Hamas wherever Hamas is [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=201.28s)]
*  in and outside of the Gaza Strip. Lieutenant Colonel, we also have up right now live on our [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=208.24s)]
*  screen, we've gone from where the hostages were being turned over to Israeli custody to now the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=213.92s)]
*  Ofer prison in the West Bank, where we know the Palestinian prisoners have been detained [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=221.04s)]
*  by the Israelis. Can you talk a little bit more about this process and the exchange of the hostages [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  and the prisoners and what we will see in the coming minutes and hours perhaps? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=232.72s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, unfortunately, Israel has been forced as part of the negotiations to free [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=237.76s)]
*  convicted felons, prisoners, some of them with blood on their hands, some of them who [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=246.32s)]
*  did attacks against Israeli military personnel or against civilians. Up until now, we've been [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=252.56s)]
*  talking about women and minors only. Hamas wanted that kind of alleged parity between our women and [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=259.12s)]
*  children that were taken from their homes on the 7th of October and Palestinian women and minors [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=268.8s)]
*  who are offenders, who are now in prison after a legal process, after they either tried to stab [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=275.36s)]
*  soldiers or civilians or threw rocks or were otherwise part of illegal activity against [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=281.52s)]
*  Israelis. So what we're going to see is the release of today's batch of Palestinians. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=287.84s)]
*  They will be returned to Judea and Samaria or the West Bank, where they come from. They are not from [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=294.79999999999995s)]
*  Gaza. And Hamas is, of course, claiming a victory. If you see the victory parades that they're doing [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=300.88s)]
*  in various Palestinian cities, you'll see very few Palestinian flags, lots of Hamas flags, and that [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=307.67999999999995s)]
*  is a worrying sign of Hamas growing and strengthening in Judea and Samaria at the expense of the [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=313.28s)]
*  Palestinian Authority. Lieutenant Colonel, as we pointed out, we're looking at pictures of the 10 [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=320.4s)]
*  Israeli hostages who were released today. In addition, as you pointed out, there are two [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=325.52s)]
*  foreign nationals. Do we know which country they are from or countries? Yes, as I understand now, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=330.71999999999997s)]
*  this is still unconfirmed, but according to the pictures and the preliminary information, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=340.24s)]
*  and I want to be cautious, these are caregivers who lived together with elderly [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=344.64s)]
*  people, Israelis, elderly Israelis, and they are from various countries. I'm afraid they are not [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=351.28000000000003s)]
*  American. I suppose that is part of the question. But I understand that there are foreign caregivers [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=357.28000000000003s)]
*  who are also taken, held in captivity without even being part of any conflict or anything. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=363.68s)]
*  They were just taken and they are now being returned. I'm of course happy for them and for [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=369.6s)]
*  their families and I'm very happy for Israeli women who are now being brought back to safety in Israel. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=374.88s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel Konricas, again, thank you so much for your time and joining us. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3t4Q0HHuQ&t=380.96000000000004s)]
