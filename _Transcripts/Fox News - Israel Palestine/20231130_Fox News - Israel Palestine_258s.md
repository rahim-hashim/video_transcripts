# Multiple arrests during anti-Israel protest in NYC
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg)
*  Back here at home police arresting multiple people after fights broke out at a pro-Palestinian rally in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=0.0s)]
*  Midtown Manhattan last night it came as thousands of people gathered to celebrate the annual Christmas tree lighting at Rockefeller Center [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=6.2s)]
*  And about a week ago [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=13.36s)]
*  New York police arrested 34 protesters at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade including some who tried gluing their hands to the middle of the parade route [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=15.08s)]
*  New York City Councilman Ari Kagan points me now to talk about this councilman [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  Good morning to you some of the signs that these protesters were holding compared the Israeli military and Israel to Nazis [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=27.92s)]
*  What do you think about that? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=35.52s)]
*  To me, I'm a son of all those survivors. It's very offensive [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=37.44s)]
*  Because they don't know what they're talking about when they talk about genocide comparing Israel to Nazis [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  And I do not recall like ceasefires truth [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  medicine water or any kind of [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=52.2s)]
*  Disappointment in World War two, you know, like so they have no idea what they're talking about [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=54.32s)]
*  They're not just wanted to disrupt and to offend they do it on purpose [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=59.2s)]
*  For Christmas tree lighting, you know, so they just embarrassed compromise and [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=64.60000000000001s)]
*  Discredited the whole idea, you know peaceful protest [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=71.36s)]
*  I think you hit the nail on the head because you mentioned the word disruption if you think about what these protesters are doing [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  At the Christmas tree lighting they shut down the Manhattan Bridge this past Sunday [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  So commuters couldn't get home from the Thanksgiving holiday. There was also the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=84.75999999999999s)]
*  We mentioned they glue in themselves to 6th Avenue. You have to wonder who are they? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=91.1s)]
*  Trying to persuade with this sort of behavior [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=96.56s)]
*  There was a New York Post op-ed that pointed out a few days ago that this is the exact opposite approach taken by Martin Luther King [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=99.64s)]
*  When he aimed for orderly protests to convince people and speak to the humanity and all of us [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=106.08000000000001s)]
*  That's not what's happening here at all. I just would like to compare it to pro-israel rally in Washington DC [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=111.64s)]
*  300,000 people came it was absolutely peaceful. It was very strong and powerful message. They sent police [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=118.4s)]
*  They sent America and they were clearly pro-israel message was sent and nothing like what we see in New York [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=124.36000000000001s)]
*  I believe that [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=130.66s)]
*  Most of them it's a loud noisy minority in my opinion [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=132.64s)]
*  Yeah [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=136.12s)]
*  That comparison is spot-on when you think about how many people peacefully protested together in Washington DC and what we're seeing in New York [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=136.48s)]
*  City and cities across the country with pro-palestinian protesters. How do you feel about mayor Eric Adams response? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=144.95999999999998s)]
*  He's on the opposite side of you politically, but on this issue. How do you think he's handling it? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=150.56s)]
*  He clearly expressed his sympathy to Israel and his pro-israel in this stance. I would like [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=155.07999999999998s)]
*  NYPD to be even more forceful in terms of arresting [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=162.79999999999998s)]
*  everybody should be equal under the law and [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=166.88s)]
*  I participated in many celebrate Israel parades all over the years on Fifth Avenue [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  Everything was very peaceful and every time we show that we strongly support the only democratic Jewish state in the world. Yeah [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=174.68s)]
*  Let's talk about the war itself because there's reporting that President Biden got on the phone with [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=181.76s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a few days ago and said you can't operate in the south in South Gaza the same way [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  You are in the north because that's where [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=192.84s)]
*  Palestinian people are how do you feel about that cautious approach that the president warned the prime minister to take? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=195.6s)]
*  I would say again [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=201.76s)]
*  I strongly believe that IDF one of the most if not the most humane army in the world [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=203.44s)]
*  Nobody would do anything like this informant. Oh, we're gonna bump here. We're gonna bump here [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=208.8s)]
*  Please move to that location or that location talking about who is not saying who is not I would say again [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=213.0s)]
*  America should send strong message to its ally Israel and to the whole world is that we stand for humanity against terror [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=219.60000000000002s)]
*  Hamas clearly hates not just Israel [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=226.88s)]
*  But America and all decent people of the world should stand with Israel and very grateful to this network for standing [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=228.96s)]
*  For humanity and for decent people and for Israel in this difficult time. Look what just happened. We just discussed [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=236.04000000000002s)]
*  Another terror attack and I would like all of these demonstrators to hold another sign we condemn Hamas [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=243.0s)]
*  I do not hear them saying are they saying we condemn Hamas for October 7 bloody massacre [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=248.04000000000002s)]
*  I don't remember humanity against terror. That is the message councilman. Thank you so much for joining us this morning [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgRU9T3ASg&t=253.16s)]
