# I can't trust anything the Biden admin tells us, Sen. Ron Johnson says
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [May 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8)
*  Let's turn to Republican Senator of Wisconsin, Ron Johnson, a member of the House of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=0.0s)]
*  Senate Homeland Security and Budget Committees. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=5.0600000000000005s)]
*  Senator, good to see you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=7.12s)]
*  What do you think about the decision not to send those bombs to Israel? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=8.32s)]
*  Well, I would consider it outrageous. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=13.16s)]
*  To put this in context, why did Hamas feel emboldened to attack on October 7th? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=15.64s)]
*  Why is Hezbollah feeling emboldened to send missiles into Israel? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Why do the Houthis feel emboldened to attack Western shipping in the Gulf? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=26.08s)]
*  It's because the Obama administration and then now the Biden administration have coddled [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=30.4s)]
*  Iran. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=34.76s)]
*  They have funneled tens, hundreds of billions of dollars into the economy, which means the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=35.76s)]
*  military of Iran. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=39.599999999999994s)]
*  And then the largest state sponsor of terror, Iran, turns around, provides that support [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=41.36s)]
*  for groups like the Houthis, Hezbollah, and Hamas. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  And so the Biden administration has not only coddled Iran, the state sponsor of Hamas, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=49.68s)]
*  but now by withholding weapons, it's showing itself to be the main protector of Hamas. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=55.36s)]
*  I mean, this is beyond outrageous. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=60.96s)]
*  The administration says, well, they're just the biggest, most destructive type of bomb [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=63.24s)]
*  because it could potentially cause such horrible civilian casualties. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=67.08s)]
*  Do you buy that? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=71.48s)]
*  Well, we're also hearing it's guidance systems for more precision bombs. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=73.28s)]
*  So who knows? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  I can't trust anything the Biden administration tells us. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  I would caution the American public to trust anything the Biden administration tells them [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=81.4s)]
*  either. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=85.32s)]
*  So we just simply don't know. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=86.32s)]
*  It's a really bad sign. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=87.52s)]
*  It's not good diplomacy. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=90.28s)]
*  It's not good to be shown to be coddling Iran. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=91.74s)]
*  It's certainly not good to be shown to be the protector of Hamas. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=94.72s)]
*  We are supporting Israel rather than doing everything we can to prevent Israel from accomplishing [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=98.0s)]
*  what it has to accomplish. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=103.0s)]
*  It has to destroy Hamas in order to defend itself long term. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=104.0s)]
*  This is an unsustainable state of affair for Israel to have a population governed by Hamas [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=107.72s)]
*  dedicated to wipe out. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=113.96000000000001s)]
*  I mean, the only people talking about genocide is Hamas against Jews and against Israel. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=115.4s)]
*  I completely understand why Israel thinks it has to destroy Hamas. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=120.52s)]
*  America's role ought to be to support Israel in that quest. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=125.48s)]
*  As horrible as war is, we didn't start this. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=127.84s)]
*  It was Hamas that ended the ceasefire. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=131.08s)]
*  It's Hamas that hides behind women and children, stores their munitions, digs their tunnels, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=133.32s)]
*  blew up hospitals. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=139.0s)]
*  That's not Israel doing that. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=140.24s)]
*  That is Hamas that is endangering Palestinian civilians. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=141.24s)]
*  Yeah, the former president yesterday in his rally in Wildwood, New Jersey, man, he really [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=144.04000000000002s)]
*  slammed the Biden administration and the president for withholding some of these arms. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=148.60000000000002s)]
*  Let's listen to what the former president said. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=152.60000000000002s)]
*  I support Israel's right to win its war on terror. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=156.20000000000002s)]
*  Is that okay? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=160.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=161.08s)]
*  I don't know if that's good or bad politically. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=162.08s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=164.44s)]
*  You got to do what's right. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=165.44s)]
*  It was a terrible attack. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=167.0s)]
*  October 7th was a terrible attack. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=168.72s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=170.8s)]
*  It's probably bad politically, but I don't care. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=171.8s)]
*  You have to do the right thing. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=173.84s)]
*  He's there talking about politically. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=176.84s)]
*  He doesn't care. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=179.12s)]
*  Do you think President Biden is being affected by the progressive wing of his party? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=180.12s)]
*  Well, absolutely. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  I mean, this is all about Biden afraid to lose Michigan. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=185.64000000000001s)]
*  And so he's pandering to the Palestinian supporters in Michigan, primarily. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=190.08s)]
*  But again, there's no doubt about there's a pro Hamas wing of the Democrat Party. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  Americans, I think, believe the former president. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=199.76s)]
*  They want to support Israel in its right to defend itself against terrorism. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=202.52s)]
*  Unfortunately, we have too many children of our children who have been indoctrinated by [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=206.4s)]
*  a radical leftist in our university system. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=210.6s)]
*  I think it's shocking to see these pro Hamas demonstrations on the university, but it shouldn't [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=212.6s)]
*  surprise anybody. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=217.6s)]
*  We have had professional agitators inside our universities for decades. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=219.4s)]
*  They're called faculty and they're called the administrators. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=223.07999999999998s)]
*  Not all, but many. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=225.52s)]
*  And it's starting to manifest itself right now in these pro Hamas demonstrations on campus. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  And what do you think the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, should do in terms of [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=232.56s)]
*  going into Arafah? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=238.16s)]
*  What's your sense? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=239.48000000000002s)]
*  The administration apparently has said just to pinpoint top of attack. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=240.92000000000002s)]
*  Should there be something stronger? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=244.76000000000002s)]
*  Should they be able to try and wipe out Hamas and go after Sinwar once and for all? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=246.70000000000002s)]
*  Well, everything I hear of Israeli public opinion, they support Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=251.72s)]
*  in destroying Hamas. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=257.28000000000003s)]
*  They may not support him politically, but they understand that Israel has destroyed Hamas. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=258.2s)]
*  We had a briefing with Prime Minister Netanyahu who said Israel is doing everything they can [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=263.92s)]
*  to protect civilians. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=268.68s)]
*  But again, it's difficult when Hamas hides behind women and children. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=270.04s)]
*  So again, I think most Americans believe that Israel has that right. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=273.72s)]
*  We need to stand behind Israel and its people. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=277.84000000000003s)]
*  Eric, if a similar terrorist attack occurred on Arseille, the same percent of Americans [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=280.92s)]
*  that got slaughtered as a 1200 Israelis, that'd be close to 50,000 Americans. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=285.68s)]
*  You can imagine what the American public would be demanding of our government to destroy [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=290.6s)]
*  to take down that threat, destroy that terrorist organization. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=295.0s)]
*  That's all the Israelis are looking to do. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=298.44s)]
*  We had a terrorist attack December 7th, 1941. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=300.64s)]
*  And here are the words of former president or then president Harry S. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=304.2s)]
*  Truman to Japan. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=307.92s)]
*  And he was very clear about the about what what happened with Japan, even though there [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=309.6s)]
*  were horrible civilian casualties. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=315.28s)]
*  This is the former president Truman's words, quote, We are now prepared to obliterate [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=316.96s)]
*  more rapidly and completely every productive enterprise the Japanese have above ground [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=322.84s)]
*  in any city. We shall destroy their docks, their factories and their communications. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=326.64s)]
*  Let there be no mistake, said Harry Truman, we shall completely destroy Japan's power [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=330.88s)]
*  to make war. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=336.79999999999995s)]
*  But Prime Minister Netanyahu has said that very same thing. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=338.23999999999995s)]
*  He has said that Israel wants to completely destroy Hamas's power to wage war. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=340.8s)]
*  How can he do that? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=347.56s)]
*  Do you think he will be able to do that? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=348.68s)]
*  Do you think Hamas can finally be defeated? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=350.6s)]
*  They had to be defeated. That's what war is about. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=354.16s)]
*  I mean, I hate war. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=357.12s)]
*  But again, it's not Israel that's under the ceasefire. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=358.76000000000005s)]
*  They have been trying to peacefully coexist with a Palestinian state. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=361.48s)]
*  They gave Gaza to to the Palestinians. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=366.72s)]
*  Palestinians, 70 percent of them voted for Hamas to be governed by Hamas, the terrorist [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=369.92s)]
*  organization that perpetrated the horrors on October 7th. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=374.32s)]
*  So again, Israel has tried. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=377.52s)]
*  I would say Israel has been over backwards. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=379.48s)]
*  But the only way you can have a two state solution is both states have to recognize the [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=382.24s)]
*  other nation's right to exist. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=386.44s)]
*  Hamas, the Palestinians obviously do not recognize Israel's right to exist. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=389.6s)]
*  So at some point in time, you have to defeat that ideology, that terrorist organization. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=394.56s)]
*  And try and find Palestinians who are willing to accept Israel's right to exist and live [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=399.8s)]
*  with them peacefully. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=405.0s)]
*  I wish that would happen sooner rather than later. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSMwmz8hl8&t=406.12s)]
