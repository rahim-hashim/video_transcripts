# This is a pause for us– this is not the end: Israeli military spokesman
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM)
*  We're bringing in now Major Doran Spielman, IDF international spokesman. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=0.0s)]
*  Major Spielman, you just heard the talk of a PR ploy on the part of Hamas. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=4.28s)]
*  If this is, in fact, what they're doing—and they're nefarious, so who knows what they're [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=10.72s)]
*  up to, exactly—but if this is the case, wouldn't it behoove them to make sure that [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  no more hostages get hurt in this exchange? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=21.64s)]
*  I think we have to put ourselves a little bit in the mind of Hamas, which is difficult [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=27.72s)]
*  to do because that same mind is the same mind that attacked citizens, immutilated people. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=32.56s)]
*  Everything that Hamas does is going to be for their own benefit. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=39.48s)]
*  It's not going to be for anybody else's benefit. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=42.08s)]
*  The reason that they are releasing our hostages—and I will pause and just say that the entire [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=44.68s)]
*  state of Israel right now has enormous mixed emotions. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=50.3s)]
*  So full of joy to see our hostages come home. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=54.68s)]
*  And at the other side, we know that there's this dark cloud of Hamas holding over 200 [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=58.64s)]
*  hostages. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=63.44s)]
*  The reason that they are making this move is because militarily speaking, we're operating [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=64.44s)]
*  on the ground. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=68.32s)]
*  And the best way to deal with their shenanigans and their deception is to continue on a military [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=69.32s)]
*  campaign when they are pushed to the wall, when they have no choice. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=75.6s)]
*  That's when they release our hostages. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=79.44s)]
*  And that's been our goal from the beginning, and that's our goal moving forward. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=80.68s)]
*  This is a pause for us. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=83.88000000000001s)]
*  This is not the end. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=85.26s)]
*  So that said, sir, if they try to extend this pause, again, by parsing out the release of [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=87.88000000000001s)]
*  these hostages, how do you handle that? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=93.66000000000001s)]
*  Because as you well know, the longer you have not as much surveillance as you had over Gaza, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=96.06s)]
*  the more that they are preparing to hurt more of your forces. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=102.12s)]
*  The framework that we have today is going on for the next few days with this continued [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=108.36s)]
*  release. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=112.75999999999999s)]
*  We hope, as you mentioned, that they do not break this ceasefire. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=113.75999999999999s)]
*  As you mentioned, Nefarious, they've done it in the past. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=116.91999999999999s)]
*  I've been on Fox News with other right conflicts that we've had with Hamas where they have [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  broken this. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=123.52s)]
*  We hope this holds. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=124.52s)]
*  I will mention this. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=125.52s)]
*  Militarily speaking, we are prepared for a lot of different scenarios. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=127.24s)]
*  We have many ways to gather information. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=130.68s)]
*  We have many ways to prepare ourselves. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=132.84s)]
*  This pause, militarily speaking for us, is a time to regroup, to refresh, and to refocus [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=135.0s)]
*  our operational goals. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=139.8s)]
*  Any decision that we make, and we're very aware of their kind of ISIS distorted strategy, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=141.44s)]
*  anything we're going to be prepared for, and it's not going to put us or our hostages at [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=147.88s)]
*  a disadvantage. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=151.56s)]
*  It's going to put us at an advantage, as we can see with our people coming home right now. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=152.56s)]
*  And you have other players in the area who may want to, again, restart this, throw in [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=157.12s)]
*  some cogs in the wheel, if you will. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=167.24s)]
*  If Hamas indeed, directly, if they're saying, okay, we're going to milk this, we're going [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=170.88s)]
*  to play along with this truce, and we're going to regroup, as we know that you are [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=174.52s)]
*  very well prepared for anything that they may counter with. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=178.4s)]
*  But what about the other bad players in the area who might want to, again, restart this [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=182.28s)]
*  fight? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=188.6s)]
*  It's a very good question. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=189.6s)]
*  As you know, we've been on a multi-front war for weeks, right? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=192.32s)]
*  We had missiles that arrived earlier today towards Eilat. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=197.6s)]
*  We had rockets fired from Yemen. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=202.22s)]
*  We've got Hezbollah in the north. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  We had uprest in Judea and Samaria from Hamas activists, thousands of them, that have tried [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=205.72s)]
*  to carry out terror attacks. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=210.85999999999999s)]
*  Your question is very much correct. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=212.29999999999998s)]
*  There is a constant kind of arc of evil, a dedication to death that really is only dedicated [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=214.42s)]
*  to death that has been governed by Iran. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=219.73999999999998s)]
*  We're aware of that. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=221.85999999999999s)]
*  At any moment in time, we know if there's an opening, if there's an opportunity for [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=222.85999999999999s)]
*  Iran or another one of these evil players to strike against Israel, they'll do so. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=228.06s)]
*  And that's why we deployed so many hundreds of thousands of soldiers. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=232.34s)]
*  We are up and ready for any scenario that's presented to us. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=235.98s)]
*  And at the same time, like a big army, we're focused on our goal of bringing these hostages home. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=241.34s)]
*  That's why we're allowing this pause, only to bring our people home. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=245.5s)]
*  We've been waiting for them for weeks. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=248.94s)]
*  I'll let nobody think that our guard is down. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=250.18s)]
*  The IDF guard is up, and it is up to stay. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=252.38000000000002s)]
*  Can I ask a question here, Major? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=255.72000000000003s)]
*  I think it's something that I've heard others ask. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=257.58000000000004s)]
*  I'm sure there must be a thought process behind it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=259.78000000000003s)]
*  We're not looking at a one-for-one. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=263.26s)]
*  50 hostages held in Hamas or held by Hamas in exchange for 50 Palestinians who are in [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=265.5s)]
*  custody. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=273.42s)]
*  Can you help explain for the people at home who don't understand why it's a 50 for 150 [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=274.9s)]
*  or one for 10? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=280.12s)]
*  Israel, on our behalf, I can tell you that we have been waiting for these people. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=284.1s)]
*  We care about our citizens. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=288.36s)]
*  There's a quote that says that one person's life is worth an entire world. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=290.1s)]
*  We are so dedicated to bringing our people home, and this is kind of our position from [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=295.08s)]
*  the very beginning. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=299.96s)]
*  Therefore, we're paying a high price. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=300.96s)]
*  To put another reference into this price, we have to understand the people that are [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=303.2s)]
*  being released on the Palestinian side, on the Hamas side, they're all convicted criminals [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=307.59999999999997s)]
*  and terrorists, meaning we're getting home innocent hostages, two-year-olds, four-year-olds, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=313.5s)]
*  this little girl, Amelia, that was in the picture on your screen with her father. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=318.28s)]
*  We're releasing back to them people who have committed heinous acts, including murder. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=322.88s)]
*  That is what we're willing to do, and the only reason we're doing it is because of our [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=327.96s)]
*  hostages. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=331.44s)]
*  And the only reason, really, that we're at war right now and that we understand Hamas [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=332.44s)]
*  has to be destroyed is because if we don't, another type situation like this is just around [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=335.71999999999997s)]
*  the corner. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=341.92s)]
*  And that is why we're willing to pay this price. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=342.92s)]
*  It would seem bizarre, but we love life and we love our people, and that's why we're [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=345.2s)]
*  willing to do it. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=348.64s)]
*  And of course, Major Spielman, you do whatever it takes to get your beloved citizens home. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=351.04s)]
*  I apologize for asking this question, but I think I have to, because there are some [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=356.0s)]
*  who are saying that Hamas has won because of the uneven exchange. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=359.96000000000004s)]
*  I think that we're looking long-term. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=368.0s)]
*  We've hit 16,000 targets. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=370.20000000000005s)]
*  We have killed numerous Hamas terrorists. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=373.32000000000005s)]
*  of their major command center, which is in northern Gaza. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=376.92s)]
*  We have forces on the ground. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=381.24s)]
*  We have taken over their key operations centers. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=382.96000000000004s)]
*  We revealed their terror acts. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=385.64000000000004s)]
*  They're on the run. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=387.6s)]
*  And I think the proof that Hamas is not winning is that they're willing to allow our hostages [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=388.8s)]
*  to come home, which is their most important bargaining chip. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=394.04s)]
*  I think any way we want to look at this, yes, we're paying a price to bring our people home, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=397.16s)]
*  but long-term, Hamas is on the path to destruction. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=401.76s)]
*  We're going to make sure they get there. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=404.88s)]
*  And I think that's where we are now. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=406.8s)]
*  We've shown enormous progress in reaching that goal. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=408.28s)]
*  Major Spielman, always a pleasure. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=411.8s)]
*  Thank you and the best to you and your countrymen as we continue to follow this story. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUGAEt15BM&t=413.44s)]
