# 12 hostages en route to Israeli territory
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o)
*  Nate Foy now is live in northern Israel for us where officials report Hamas has just violated [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=0.0s)]
*  terms of the ceasefire. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  Nate, what can you tell us is happening right now? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=7.04s)]
*  Well, Sandra, both Israel and Hamas blame each other for, in their view, violating the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=9.96s)]
*  terms of that temporary ceasefire. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=16.76s)]
*  The IDF says there were three explosions in northern Gaza today that injured several IDF [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=18.72s)]
*  soldiers, none of them seriously. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=25.04s)]
*  There was concerns that this would impact today's prisoner hostage exchange, which [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=27.48s)]
*  it does not appear that it has. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=32.76s)]
*  In fact, we just learned that the Red Cross now has 10 Israeli hostages in their care [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=34.84s)]
*  in Gaza right now making their way to the Rafa crossing. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=41.52s)]
*  Take a look at this video. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=44.8s)]
*  This is the fifth straight day now that hostages have made their way back to Israel in exchange [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=46.24s)]
*  for Palestinian prisoners. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=52.32s)]
*  We know this is 10 Israeli women, nine women actually as old as 84 years old, and then [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=54.14s)]
*  a 17-year-old girl named Mia Lamberg who was just seen going to the Red Cross with a dog [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=59.38s)]
*  that apparently has been in her possession for the past 53 days. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=68.1s)]
*  Again, this is the fifth straight day that there has been an exchange, another 30 Palestinian [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=72.18s)]
*  prisoners going back as part of that deal. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=78.22s)]
*  Those Israeli hostages will make their way into Egypt and then Israel either by bus [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=82.86s)]
*  or helicopter once they've been evaluated medically and psychologically and then they'll [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=89.28s)]
*  reunite with their families. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=93.46s)]
*  But I want to show you that scene from northern Gaza earlier today. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=95.22s)]
*  Take a look at this video. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=99.18s)]
*  This is the most blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement so far. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=101.1s)]
*  Again, none of the injuries to Israeli soldiers are considered serious. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=105.9s)]
*  Right now over 150 hostages remain in Gaza, but not all of them are with Hamas. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=111.0s)]
*  The IDF says 10-month-old baby Kefir Bebas and his four-year-old brother Ariel were [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=117.12s)]
*  both handed off to another terrorist group in Gaza, but Israel and the boys' family still [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=122.52s)]
*  hold Hamas responsible. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=127.62s)]
*  Maybe it's part of a psychological war against us. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=132.28s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=134.76s)]
*  It's working really good because the last four days has been a nightmare for us. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=137.34s)]
*  This has been 52 days for a baby and a boy in captivity. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=141.58s)]
*  There is no precedent in modern history for something like this. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=148.22s)]
*  Sandra, that psychological warfare has continued today. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=154.74s)]
*  There was a delay in getting these Israeli hostages back, but again, they're now with [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=159.38s)]
*  the Red Cross and on their way back to Israel. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=163.7s)]
*  We'll send it back to you, Sandra. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=166.73999999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=167.73999999999998s)]
*  Nate Foy there live in northern Israel for us. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=168.73999999999998s)]
*  And as we Fox News Alert on here, we are confirming 12 hostages released tonight. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=169.73999999999998s)]
*  This is per the IDF. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=177.01999999999998s)]
*  This is breaking just now. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=178.29999999999998s)]
*  Will be released 10 Israelis and two foreign nationals. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=180.78s)]
*  Exactly what we know. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=184.34s)]
*  Based on information that was received from the Red Cross going through the IDF, 12 hostages, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=185.73999999999998s)]
*  including 10 Israelis and two foreign nationals, are on their way toward Israeli territory. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=191.5s)]
*  That just in. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=197.14s)]
*  John? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=198.14s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=199.14s)]
*  Let's bring in retired Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=200.14s)]
*  So we don't know who the foreign nationals are. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=201.7s)]
*  We hope that they might be two of the eight or nine Americans who are still being held [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=205.22s)]
*  by Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=210.3s)]
*  We don't know which. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=212.78s)]
*  William Burns is currently in Doha, Qatar, along with the head of the Mossad having talks [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=213.98s)]
*  with the Qatari prime minister to try to get the Americans out with this ceasefire [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=219.22s)]
*  violation. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=224.9s)]
*  But yet at the same time, the hostages are still being released. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=225.9s)]
*  What do you make of where we are in this process? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=230.22s)]
*  Yeah, John, thanks for having me. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=232.98s)]
*  I don't think they know where all the hostages are. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=234.78s)]
*  I think they're not too sure. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=236.7s)]
*  This is Hamas. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=238.54s)]
*  Hamas knows where they're at. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=239.54s)]
*  Here's what I think the administration should do. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=241.22s)]
*  And I know they've got the CIA director there. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=242.94s)]
*  We've worked well with Al Thani in the past, the emir of Qatar, worked well with him in [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=245.5s)]
*  the last administration. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=250.14s)]
*  Also sitting in Qatar is the chief political adviser for Hamas, which is Hanegah. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=252.66s)]
*  And I'd say get those two together and say, one... [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=258.3s)]
*  Well, he's not just the political adviser. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=260.38s)]
*  He's the head of the political wing of Hamas. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=261.94s)]
*  Of Hamas. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=263.82s)]
*  And I'd say, one, let's get into the counting of where everybody's at. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=264.82s)]
*  Do you have a full accounting of these people? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=268.3s)]
*  Where are the Americans at? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=270.22s)]
*  I think it's kind of an insult to the Americans who've been a key pusher of this whole ceasefire [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=271.3s)]
*  to not have any Americans come out, except they're the ones they had recently come out [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=276.82000000000005s)]
*  just the other day. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=280.58000000000004s)]
*  So I think there's a real problem on accountability, where they're at, where they're coming out. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=281.58000000000004s)]
*  I think Hamas is using this very, very well strategically. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=284.86s)]
*  And what I mean by that is they're pushing this out because they want a ceasefire. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=289.74s)]
*  They want a long-term effort. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=293.46000000000004s)]
*  And I think this administration is actually into that game where it's a ceasefire or a [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=295.02000000000004s)]
*  pause. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=299.22s)]
*  And it works against the Israelis because the Israelis want to finish this job. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=300.22s)]
*  They want to eradicate Hamas. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=304.66s)]
*  But I think that's, in this administration, it's not a primary goal, it's not a secondary [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=306.42s)]
*  goal, probably a tertiary one. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=309.82000000000005s)]
*  So it really is playing into Hamas' hands in essence. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=311.1s)]
*  But that's the reason why they took these hostages in the first place, so that when [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=313.66s)]
*  their back was against the wall as it is now, they could try to slow roll this whole thing [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=316.62s)]
*  by saying, well, we'll release some hostages here, some hostages there, as long as there's [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=321.26000000000005s)]
*  a ceasefire. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=325.54s)]
*  And as the ceasefire is taking place, of course, Hamas is regrouping, rearming, and bringing [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=326.98s)]
*  international pressure to bear on Israel to make this ceasefire permanent so that Hamas [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=332.06s)]
*  can survive, which is exactly the opposite of what every Israeli official and literally [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=336.58000000000004s)]
*  every Israeli that I talked to when I was over there said. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=342.54s)]
*  They said enough of this game of cat and mouse with Hamas. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=345.98s)]
*  This has got to end. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=348.6s)]
*  One way or another, it's got to end. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=349.76s)]
*  But if Hamas has its way, it's not going to end. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=351.76s)]
*  Where I come from, decency and depravity shouldn't be in the same neighborhood. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=354.46000000000004s)]
*  And you're looking at Hamas and the Israelis that are there. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=357.82s)]
*  And I think Israel should be allowed to finish that job. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=360.18s)]
*  They've got to eradicate Hamas, because if they don't, then this is just going to go [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=362.82s)]
*  on and on and on. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=366.54s)]
*  And they can bring in somebody else to represent the Palestinians. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=367.78000000000003s)]
*  There are people out there they can do that with. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=371.04s)]
*  You know, you've got Mohammed Dallin, who's sitting in UAE right now, who is part of the [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=373.02000000000004s)]
*  old Fatah organization. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=377.70000000000005s)]
*  But he's a relatively young man who's involved with the Palestinians. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=379.26s)]
*  Bring somebody like that in. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=383.14s)]
*  Get rid of my home boss and bring somebody in who can actually work with the Israelis. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=384.14s)]
*  You know, one of the stories that we have been following today is the story of Kefir [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=389.21999999999997s)]
*  Bubas, who is the 10-month-old, I think 11 months old now, because I think he had a one-month [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=392.3s)]
*  anniversary at least in captivity. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=397.4s)]
*  We have no idea what the status of Kefir is. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=400.34s)]
*  Maybe he's among these 10 Israelis that have been released, because Hamas does this. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=404.78s)]
*  He watches the flow of news and says, oh, here's how we can gain some good PR. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=409.56s)]
*  Let's release maybe Kefir Bubas or somebody else. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=414.48s)]
*  But here's what Kefir Bubas' great aunt said about what Hamas is doing. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=416.92s)]
*  Listen here. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=421.04s)]
*  I can't say we are surprised about the level of cruelty and unhumane behavior from Hamas. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=422.04s)]
*  In this deal, in this ceasefire, they signed an agreement to release all women and children. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=430.68s)]
*  Tomorrow is the last day, supposedly, of this ceasefire, of this agreement, as it [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=438.2s)]
*  was signed. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=445.64s)]
*  And there's still no news about my family, if they'll be returned or not. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=446.64s)]
*  You can imagine the stress that the family is under. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=453.59999999999997s)]
*  Now, hopefully, Hamas wouldn't let a baby die in captivity. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=458.4s)]
*  We don't know, though. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=464.2s)]
*  But I just wonder if, given the flow of news today, and Hamas looking for a PR victory, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=465.44s)]
*  if maybe Kefir Bubas is among these hostages who have been released. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=470.76s)]
*  But we've also heard that he was turned over to another terror organization. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=475.68s)]
*  We don't know if it was Palestinian Islamic Jihad or somebody else. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=480.12s)]
*  Yeah, that's where I go back to this accountability. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=482.68s)]
*  I don't think they know where they're at. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=484.68s)]
*  Look, let's make sure we fully understand and realize, in 7 October, they killed 31 [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=486.15999999999997s)]
*  Americans. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=491.92s)]
*  These people are not Jeffersonian Democrats. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=492.92s)]
*  They're a terrorist organization. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=494.96s)]
*  We designated them a terrorist organization in 1997. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=496.52s)]
*  They are not friends of the Israeli. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=499.68s)]
*  They call them Zionists. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=501.68s)]
*  They want to eliminate Jews and eliminate the state of Israel. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=503.08s)]
*  And we have now started to treat this primarily as a hostage recovery issue. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=506.56s)]
*  And I think we're shortchanging the Israelis. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=510.91999999999996s)]
*  They are looking at this much differently. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=513.54s)]
*  This to them is something that is existential in nature. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=515.68s)]
*  This is a fight for survival. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=518.92s)]
*  And we need to realize this and support them to the best degree possible. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=520.84s)]
*  I hate to say this, and I don't have any reason to say this with any great knowledge, but [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=524.36s)]
*  I still believe I don't think they know where they're all at. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=529.12s)]
*  I'm not sure you're ever going to get a full account in. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=531.44s)]
*  You know, Amos is everything that you said they are, but they also know how to play to [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=534.24s)]
*  international sympathy. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=538.36s)]
*  Just look at college campuses across America. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=540.1600000000001s)]
*  That'll tell you that. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=543.0s)]
*  I go home every day to graffiti that's sprayed on an overpass on the George Washington Parkway [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=544.4000000000001s)]
*  that talks about freeing Gaza, right? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=549.8800000000001s)]
*  Peace fire in Gaza, free Gaza. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=552.68s)]
*  They know how to play the PR game. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=555.12s)]
*  The goal of Yaya Sinemar, who is the leader of Hamas in Gaza, is to survive. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=559.1999999999999s)]
*  And they know how to do that. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=567.04s)]
*  That's why they've got this rabbit war in of tunnels underneath 300 miles of Gaza. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=568.3s)]
*  This is how they can survive against a far superior military. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=572.52s)]
*  But if they can bring enough international pressure to bear against Israel, that, I mean, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=576.8s)]
*  obviously it wouldn't be political suicide in Israel, but it would be potentially very [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=582.4799999999999s)]
*  difficult for Netanyahu to say, we're starting the bombing again. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=587.04s)]
*  He's determined to do it, but against such international pressure, how does he do it [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=590.8399999999999s)]
*  without becoming an international pariah? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=594.4399999999999s)]
*  I think everybody needs to stand up to include the president of the United States and everybody [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=596.28s)]
*  across the world and say, there's a level of moral certitude here. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=599.4599999999999s)]
*  This is wrong. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=603.4599999999999s)]
*  What they have done has gone beyond the pale. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=604.66s)]
*  And we need to push back on that really hard. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=607.2199999999999s)]
*  We haven't seen this type of extermination of the Jews since the Holocaust. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=608.9399999999999s)]
*  And let's make it very clear to you. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=613.4s)]
*  You're picking a moral path. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=615.5s)]
*  What side of the moral equations you want to be on? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=616.88s)]
*  And I think that when you stand in front of the press, and the president should do this, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=618.98s)]
*  he needs to use that ability to stand in front of everybody and say, this is where we're [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=623.02s)]
*  at. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=627.4599999999999s)]
*  But the second part of that, because there's a duality here, there's this duality of the [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=628.4599999999999s)]
*  hostages. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=632.42s)]
*  But he also needs to tell the Israelis, we've got your back and you need to finish Hamas [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=633.42s)]
*  off. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=637.14s)]
*  The only way this is going to get solved is if they eradicate, in the purest definition [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=638.14s)]
*  of the term, eradicate Hamas. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=642.38s)]
*  But the president almost seems like he's going wobbly on that front because he knows that [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=644.18s)]
*  he's losing political support among Arab Americans. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=648.2199999999999s)]
*  Arab Americans in Michigan are saying, we're not going to vote for you. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=652.26s)]
*  And when you take a look at the margins in the 2020 election, the president beat Donald [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=656.86s)]
*  Trump by 150,000. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=661.5s)]
*  There's 250,000 Arab Americans, concentrated, I guess is the word, in the Dearborn, Michigan [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=662.5s)]
*  area. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=671.06s)]
*  He looks at potentially losing Michigan if he stands side to side with the Israelis and [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=672.06s)]
*  doesn't give a nod to the Palestinian side. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=676.94s)]
*  And the best way for him to do that is to get out there and say, let's keep this ceasefire [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=679.82s)]
*  going. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=685.74s)]
*  John Kirby has said on many occasions, and I think the president has said it a couple [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=686.74s)]
*  of times, too, that a ceasefire would only play into the hands of Hamas. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=690.14s)]
*  We're not hearing that to the same degree that we were weeks ago. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=693.9s)]
*  Yeah, I wish he'd read the book Profiles in Courage again. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=697.02s)]
*  Maybe he can figure out where he's supposed to be going, the one that Kennedy wrote years [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=700.54s)]
*  ago. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=703.3s)]
*  Look, there's a moral equivalence here that I want to make sure everybody understands. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=704.3s)]
*  It's very, very clear to me. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=707.06s)]
*  And it should be clear to everybody in the world. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=708.74s)]
*  And he needs to take a stand. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=710.34s)]
*  And when you look what's happening in Israel and what happened on 7 October, really is [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=712.58s)]
*  a very, very clear mark, a very clear mark line. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=717.42s)]
*  We say you're on either this side, the right of decency and justice, or on the side of [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=720.74s)]
*  depravity. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=724.6999999999999s)]
*  And that's what I said earlier, these two things don't work together well in that area. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=725.6999999999999s)]
*  And I'm talking about Hamas and the depravity of their actions and the decency of a democratic [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=730.74s)]
*  nation in Israel. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=736.0999999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=737.74s)]
*  General, thank you. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=738.74s)]
*  These are Israeli hostages being transferred from, I guess, the International Committee [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=739.88s)]
*  of the Red Cross into Israeli custody at the Rafa crossing. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiKY657g_o&t=746.48s)]
