# Iran orders retaliatory strike against Israel: Report
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [July 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXOmJrhacCU)
*  So joining me now, retired Navy Captain Brent Sadler. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXOmJrhacCU&t=0.0s)]
*  He is senior research fellow for naval warfare and advanced technology at the Heritage Foundation's [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXOmJrhacCU&t=3.0s)]
*  Allison Center for National Security. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXOmJrhacCU&t=8.68s)]
*  Brent, good to have you here today. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXOmJrhacCU&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Your thoughts on these huge explosive developments in the Middle East, these two killings within [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXOmJrhacCU&t=13.3s)]
*  48 hours that appear to be carried out by Israel in their effort to fight back against [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXOmJrhacCU&t=18.2s)]
*  Iran and their proxies. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXOmJrhacCU&t=25.68s)]
*  Well, thanks for having me on. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXOmJrhacCU&t=27.96s)]
*  These last 24 hours have been remarkable for sure. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXOmJrhacCU&t=30.36s)]
*  Taking out the leader of Hamas, a terror organization, a man with 17 American lives on his hands, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXOmJrhacCU&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  finally meeting his demise. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXOmJrhacCU&t=41.32s)]
*  And then, of course, you've got the senior military leader Tehizbullah, responsible for [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXOmJrhacCU&t=42.8s)]
*  an attack that killed children in the Golan Heights, the northern Israel area, just also [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXOmJrhacCU&t=47.6s)]
*  within the last day or so. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXOmJrhacCU&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  So serious, significant events. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXOmJrhacCU&t=55.0s)]
*  I think Iran is likely to respond, but I think it's going to be probably a lot more muted [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXOmJrhacCU&t=56.7s)]
*  than it was in April when it responded to this large number of killings of IRGC generals [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXOmJrhacCU&t=62.1s)]
*  and senior leadership in Syria earlier this year. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXOmJrhacCU&t=67.74000000000001s)]
*  Again, Iran operates its influence through its IRGC through the region. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXOmJrhacCU&t=71.5s)]
*  And you sever that, they lose a lot of power and influence. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXOmJrhacCU&t=76.42s)]
*  And that's actually what's at stake with these leaders being taken off the board. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXOmJrhacCU&t=79.86s)]
*  This is Anthony Blinken, the secretary of state, talking about American, U.S. knowledge of [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXOmJrhacCU&t=85.3s)]
*  any of this. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXOmJrhacCU&t=91.14s)]
*  Let's watch. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXOmJrhacCU&t=92.14s)]
*  This is something we were not aware of or involved in. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXOmJrhacCU&t=94.14s)]
*  The best way to bring temperature down everywhere and to put us on a better path is through [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXOmJrhacCU&t=97.41999999999999s)]
*  a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXOmJrhacCU&t=104.53999999999999s)]
*  Your thoughts on that, sir? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXOmJrhacCU&t=106.97999999999999s)]
*  It might have been worthwhile not having this administration cut into the loop to make sure [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXOmJrhacCU&t=109.14s)]
*  that whoever was planning these attacks would be successful for operational security. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXOmJrhacCU&t=115.22s)]
*  I would think if Israel was behind it, there would have been at least some forewarning [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXOmJrhacCU&t=120.7s)]
*  to military forces so that we could be prepared and protect ourselves. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXOmJrhacCU&t=124.46s)]
*  Brent Sadler, thank you very much. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXOmJrhacCU&t=129.42s)]
*  Hope to have you back soon, sir. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXOmJrhacCU&t=131.14s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXOmJrhacCU&t=132.62s)]
