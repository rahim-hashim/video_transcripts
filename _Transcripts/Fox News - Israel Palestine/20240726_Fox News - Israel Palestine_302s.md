# Brig. Gen. Amir Avivi: We cannot afford not destroying Hamas
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [July 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ)
*  I'm going to bring up General Amir Aviv, the Israel Defense and Security Forum chairman [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=0.0s)]
*  and founder. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=6.08s)]
*  General, very good to have you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=7.08s)]
*  You heard what Donald Trump was saying about Kamala Harris's remarks to Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=9.8s)]
*  that they were not nice. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=17.12s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu has characterized what she said after that meeting that he had with [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=18.84s)]
*  her as not being the same as what was said in that meeting with her. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=24.0s)]
*  I don't know who's right and what's right, but I did want to get your thoughts. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=28.8s)]
*  Well, I think that definitely looking at what's going on inside Gaza, the Israeli Defense [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=32.4s)]
*  Forces are fighting fiercely, but according to international law, Israeli forces are trying [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=40.56s)]
*  to minimize casualties on the civilian side. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  There is no hunger inside Gaza. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=49.32s)]
*  There is no crisis inside Gaza. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=52.96s)]
*  Gaza, yes, it's a war. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=56.48s)]
*  In a war, it's always complicated and difficult. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=57.48s)]
*  But this is a war. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=60.16s)]
*  Israel must win decisively. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=61.559999999999995s)]
*  This is really a crucial issue for Israel. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=65.0s)]
*  It's existential. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=68.24s)]
*  We cannot afford not destroying Hamas, and Israel is going to do that. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=69.46s)]
*  It's going to continue and fight until we reach the point Hamas will be destroyed. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=73.88s)]
*  OK, so just to understand, sir, and perhaps my question wasn't clear, that Kamala Harris [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=80.8s)]
*  said some things that Benjamin Netanyahu said she didn't raise in their one-on-one. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=88.24s)]
*  Now, different interpretations, I understand. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=94.24s)]
*  But the clear impression that many got looking at this meeting is that Israel, which has [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=98.08s)]
*  had a problematic relationship with Joe Biden, despite his strong support of Israel in the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=105.08s)]
*  war against Hamas, might have an even more problematic one with Kamala Harris, should [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=109.12s)]
*  she become president. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  Do you agree with that? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=115.32000000000001s)]
*  Well, it might happen. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  I mean, we need to be really clear who are the good guys and who are the bad guys. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  And we are the good guys. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=124.88000000000001s)]
*  And the bad guys are Hamas, the bad guys are Iran, and we need to be very, very clear. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=126.80000000000001s)]
*  We need a strong America. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=132.32s)]
*  We need leadership. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  We need willingness to fight, because Iran is moving towards nuclear weapons. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=135.35999999999999s)]
*  The whole Middle East is completely destabilized. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=142.0s)]
*  And if we don't send a strong message, a clear message of leadership, we might find ourselves [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=145.2s)]
*  on the verge of a Third World War. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=151.0s)]
*  China is watching. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=153.24s)]
*  Russia is watching. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=154.4s)]
*  And everybody is looking at what will be the policy of the next administration. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=156.28s)]
*  And we definitely need a strong leader that will stabilize the whole globe and the region. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=160.96s)]
*  And we cannot have a policy of appeasement with our enemies, especially not Iran and [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=167.8s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=172.96s)]
*  So, General, Donald Trump himself, who says he's been the strongest and best president [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=175.60000000000002s)]
*  for Israel, I don't know how you feel about that, but he has also said the problem with [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=180.52s)]
*  Israel right now is that you got to wrap this up fast. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  I'm sure that has been your goal since this war started last October, but that you're [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=187.12s)]
*  losing the PR war. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  I'm paraphrasing him. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=194.16000000000003s)]
*  How do you feel about that and the pressure he would have that he becomes president again [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=196.04000000000002s)]
*  to get you to wrap this up? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=200.52s)]
*  Well, President Trump has done amazing things for Israel. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=204.12s)]
*  He recognized the Golan Heights. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=207.44s)]
*  He moved the embassy to Jerusalem. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=208.84s)]
*  He brought us four peace agreements, and we remember that, and we appreciate it a lot. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=210.52s)]
*  But President, former President Trump has to understand this is a long war. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=215.8s)]
*  We cannot wrap it up. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=220.4s)]
*  It will take years to dismantle this terrible terror organization. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=222.24s)]
*  I can say that in 2002, when we launched Operation Defensive Shield in the area of Judean Samurai, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=227.76s)]
*  it took us a month and a half to take initial control of the cities. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=233.52s)]
*  It took us five months, five years, sorry, to stabilize the situation, five years. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=237.32s)]
*  So this is the first fight. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=242.88s)]
*  It's a complex war. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=245.07999999999998s)]
*  You cannot wrap it up. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=246.79999999999998s)]
*  We need to destroy Hamas. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=248.44s)]
*  It will take a very long time. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=249.44s)]
*  And we have to remember that we have Hezbollah on the north. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=251.76s)]
*  We have 80,000 people displaced. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=255.07999999999998s)]
*  We'll have to deal also with Hezbollah. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=257.52s)]
*  And the main thing we need to do from the U.S.—and this is what basically Netanyahu [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=259.4s)]
*  said—we need support and we need munitions to sustain this war, and we need decisively. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=265.03999999999996s)]
*  And it's not only for Israel. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=271.6s)]
*  This is a war that needs to be won for the whole Western civilization, including the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=273.76s)]
*  U.S. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=278.32s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=279.32s)]
*  Well, I don't think Donald Trump is ready for years, but we'll see how that all sorts [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=280.32s)]
*  out. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=286.44s)]
*  But, General, thank you very much. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=287.44s)]
*  An honor having you. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrmw1qIfsQ&t=288.44s)]
