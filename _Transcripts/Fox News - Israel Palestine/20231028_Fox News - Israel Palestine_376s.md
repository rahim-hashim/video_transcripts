# Iran's malign behavior, funding of Hamas terror must be met with US resolve: Ollie North
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU)
*  Joining us now, Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=0.0s)]
*  Colonel North, let's get your assessment. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=2.44s)]
*  I want to go back to the same line of questioning I had with Secretary Pompeo. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=3.44s)]
*  I understand the need for intelligence on the ground and even boots on the ground for [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  Israel. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=11.4s)]
*  However, if you know where the network of tunnels are, why not use military, sophisticated, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=12.4s)]
*  new military technology and take out as many of those tunnels as possible from the air [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=18.28s)]
*  and not risk a ground incursion, where, like our troops in Iraq, we didn't have this [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  technology, you know, are going to be stepping over IEDs every other 10 feet or so. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=29.36s)]
*  Well, first of all, Sean, Israel's attack plan is much more sophisticated than it's [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=35.36s)]
*  coming across in the media. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=41.400000000000006s)]
*  The campaign in Gaza isn't just one point of entry. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=43.68s)]
*  It's all along a 30-mile long border. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=46.96s)]
*  There are zones of action, prep fires. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=49.8s)]
*  They're going to have to clear buildings, then clear entire city blocks, and they're [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=51.96s)]
*  going to shoot back. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=55.36s)]
*  That's the rules of engagement that they've got. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=56.36s)]
*  They're going to do everything in their power to avoid inflicting civilian casualties. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=59.8s)]
*  They've got devices and they've got munitions that are not widely known that they're going [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=64.8s)]
*  to use in those tunnels. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=70.24s)]
*  There's ways in which you want to make sure that you're not—good Lord, forgive if [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=71.92s)]
*  all those hostages were banded up in one long tunnel that got attacked by Israel. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=76.52s)]
*  That would—we'd pay for that for decades. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=80.44s)]
*  So what we're looking at is a situation where these guys know what they're doing. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=82.75999999999999s)]
*  What I'm more concerned about are the questions you asked the good secretary, and I'm glad [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=88.2s)]
*  he's on with you, because he's a dear friend and I have enormous respect for him. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=92.68s)]
*  But what took place on the 7th of October that took the lives of at least 30 AMSATs [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=96.44s)]
*  could not have happened but for Iran. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=101.56s)]
*  If they turn Hezbollah loose from their bases in Lebanon and Syria to attack Israel, it [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=104.0s)]
*  should not come as a surprise that Iranian-built missiles, whether they're fired from Iran [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=109.04s)]
*  or from Lebanon or from, God forbid, Gaza, that they will soon be firing at U.S. naval [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=113.72s)]
*  assets in the Mediterranean. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=119.88s)]
*  The president should immediately, tomorrow morning, announce all existing sanctions against [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=121.8s)]
*  the regime in Tehran will be immediately enforced, and he's going to have to immediately lift [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=126.88s)]
*  his own self-imposed shutdowns on fracking and drilling and reassure the American people [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=131.4s)]
*  we're not going to run out of fuel. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  And by the way, refill our strategic petroleum reserves. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=137.76s)]
*  Number two, if Hezbollah attacks Israel, the U.S. will hold the Iranian theocracy responsible [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  and act with devastating effect to prevent further threats to U.S. personnel and assets. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=146.67999999999998s)]
*  Number three, the president should also direct the U.S. Department of Justice to indict the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=151.23999999999998s)]
*  terrorist leaders like Yaa Hassanwar and Hamas head of state Ismail Haniya, the so-called [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=156.23999999999998s)]
*  Hamas foreign minister, for killing at least 30 American citizens ever since the 7th of [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=161.6s)]
*  October. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=166.51999999999998s)]
*  And though we don't have an extradition agreement with Qatar, an interpol posting of those guys' [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=167.56s)]
*  faces in airports around the world might keep these thugs from traveling freely around to [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=171.96s)]
*  the whorehouses that they're known to visit. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=177.32000000000002s)]
*  Number five, he needs to order the National Guard to secure our southern border immediately. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=180.08s)]
*  Number six, notify the Iranians that if Hezbollah attacks Israel, we will shut down Iran's [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=184.78s)]
*  entire oil export capability. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=190.84s)]
*  That's one of the things that the secretary was just referring to much more diplomatically [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=193.32000000000002s)]
*  than I did. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=196.68s)]
*  That should make all those who are filling the Ayatollah's coffers with billions, as [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=197.68s)]
*  you pointed out, will bring some pressure to bear on Tehran. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=201.84s)]
*  For example, Beijing might just pick up the phone and say, hey, guys, knock it off. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=205.4s)]
*  We need your oil. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=209.64000000000001s)]
*  And finally, we ought to offer Al Sisi in Cairo, U.S. air traffic control and logistics [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=210.72s)]
*  assistance to open a major secure refugee facility and humanitarian food, water and [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=217.04000000000002s)]
*  facility near Al-Arish International Airport in Gaza. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=223.28s)]
*  I've been there. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=227.56s)]
*  I've seen this in Sinai, rather, just south of Gaza. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=228.88s)]
*  And that border crossing could become an enormous refugee center in which we get the biometric [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=233.76s)]
*  data on every refugee waiting to avail themselves of food, water, medicine and shelter and the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=239.64s)]
*  kinds of things that we're trying to ship across the border and Hamas is stealing. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=246.76s)]
*  That's it. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  Seven points. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=252.35999999999999s)]
*  This, Colonel, you were on my shows so often post-9-11. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  We spent a lot of personal time. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=258.36s)]
*  For me, getting to know you, being a best friend of yours was like a dream come true [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=259.92s)]
*  for me. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=265.48s)]
*  I grew up admiring you. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=266.48s)]
*  It's one of the reasons I got in this business. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=267.48s)]
*  And we spent a lot of time together. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=270.0s)]
*  I didn't like a lot of the 9-11 Commission report, didn't agree with it, didn't think [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=272.24s)]
*  it was firm enough, but they got one thing very, very right. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=275.68s)]
*  They were at war with us. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=278.52s)]
*  We were not at war with them. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=279.92s)]
*  We have been witnessing literally tens and tens and hundreds of thousands of rockets [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=281.92s)]
*  fired into Israeli cities. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=288.52000000000004s)]
*  It has been going on for year after year after year. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=290.40000000000003s)]
*  We've known about this network of tunnels for quite some time. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=294.48s)]
*  If the takeaway from the 9-11 Commission was, they were at war with us, we weren't at war [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=298.96000000000004s)]
*  with them, what part of these rockets fired into Israeli cities and these network of tunnels [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=303.64s)]
*  built to kill and capture Israelis was not any indication that they were in a full-fledged [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=309.88s)]
*  war against Israel. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=317.96000000000004s)]
*  Why did it take October 7th? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=319.72s)]
*  We are still the great Satan. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  The little Satan is the Israel that they want to destroy first. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=324.76s)]
*  That's number one. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=328.64s)]
*  Number two, we have allowed, particularly since the Obama administration and now certainly [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=329.72s)]
*  the Iranians to get away with all kinds of terrible things. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=336.2s)]
*  And the secretary was wise to point out and remind everybody that we took out the architect [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=340.24s)]
*  of what a lot of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Quds Force have done around [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=345.24s)]
*  the world to make enemies of ours able to carry out attacks on Americans. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=349.48s)]
*  That's the kind of leadership that we desperately need back in Washington. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=356.4s)]
*  All right, Colonel North, stay with us. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=360.08s)]
*  We'll get back to you throughout the evening as well. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvq6GDdtrU&t=362.12s)]
