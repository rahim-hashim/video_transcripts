# Hamas is doing this ‘out of self-interest’: Retired Army Lt. Col.
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas)
*  Of course they don't have a humanitarian bone in their bodies. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=0.0s)]
*  They absolutely don't care. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=3.0s)]
*  And the release of 13 women and children is obviously an effort to get women and children [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  out of the hands of Hamas, knowing the atrocities that they committed to women and children [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=11.52s)]
*  and the elderly and grandmothers and families in front of each other. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=15.700000000000001s)]
*  First of all, talk about the numbers between 50 hostages being released compared to the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=20.6s)]
*  150 Palestinian prisoners that will be swapped in exchange. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=26.34s)]
*  Obviously a bad deal for Israel, but the pressure of course was on by families who wanted their [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=32.22s)]
*  loved ones home safely. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=36.980000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, Julie, that's the concern here is of course the delay tactic as Ambassador Bolton [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=38.94s)]
*  there mentioned. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=44.620000000000005s)]
*  This is just to string things out, make it take longer, and of course Hamas will take [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=45.94s)]
*  advantage of these gaps in time to do what terrorists do best, which is prepare more [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=49.66s)]
*  terrorist activity, whether it be in Israel or in Gaza. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=55.42s)]
*  They're going to use this to their advantage somehow. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=58.86s)]
*  They can care less about the humanitarian aspect of this. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=60.78s)]
*  And this just goes back to why you don't negotiate with terrorists. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=63.300000000000004s)]
*  And this assumes right now that they're even going to keep their end of the bargain in [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=66.7s)]
*  the first place, which right now I'd be cautious with that at all. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=69.9s)]
*  And that's why they're going to spread this out over a four day period. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=73.46000000000001s)]
*  So they're going to start with 13 women and children starting tomorrow. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=76.22s)]
*  The truce begins at midnight. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=80.06s)]
*  Nine a.m. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=81.46000000000001s)]
*  Eastern time is when those hostages will be released. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=82.46000000000001s)]
*  And then over the course of four days, you know, a couple dozen here and there until [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=84.62s)]
*  they reach that number 50. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=88.66s)]
*  There are still 240, though, let's not forget, hostages that are being held. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=90.58s)]
*  And that's not counting those that could have potentially been killed and captured. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=95.58s)]
*  So, you know, talk to me about how Israel is going to make sure that Hamas holds up [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=99.22s)]
*  their end of the bargain, especially knowing the treatment of these hostages as we speak. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=104.02s)]
*  Well, first, I guess I would be skeptical, skeptical about Hamas's desire to even hold [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=110.42s)]
*  up their end of the bargain. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=115.66s)]
*  And Israel has limited capability to enforce that part of it. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=116.66s)]
*  In fact, the only thing they can truly continue to do is continue military operations with [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=121.1s)]
*  the desire to find those hostages and to free them themselves. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=125.74000000000001s)]
*  And there's another part of this bargain, too, that kind of shows you where Hamas is [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=130.78s)]
*  coming from, which is they don't want senior leadership of Hamas being targeted during [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=133.38s)]
*  any of these ceasefires either, especially after Assad has been told to target all senior [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=137.44s)]
*  Hamas-level leadership, regardless of what's going on. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=144.04s)]
*  So Hamas is doing this out of self-interest, not humanitarian interest. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=147.2s)]
*  I think it's best for Israel to regain the initiative and continue this operation the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=151.64s)]
*  way they see best to meet their strategic objectives. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=156.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=159.44s)]
*  You know, today's Iran's foreign minister met with the leader of Hezbollah, and Hamas [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=160.44s)]
*  and Islamic Jihad officials in Lebanon. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=165.72s)]
*  Iran, as we know, is the main state sponsor of the three terror groups. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=168.60000000000002s)]
*  So their involvement is extremely troubling and extremely threatening to Israel. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=174.52s)]
*  It is their second meeting since October 7th, by the way, and that is obviously only stoking [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=179.28s)]
*  fears of a wider war, something that the Defense Department says they're aiming to avoid. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=183.94s)]
*  Listen. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=189.32000000000002s)]
*  We pulled into a regional conflict both from attacks on our troops and also from what is [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=190.6s)]
*  happening in Israel. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=196.23999999999998s)]
*  We are hitting them where it hurts. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=198.0s)]
*  We are hitting weapons storage facilities and completely destroying them so they're [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=200.04s)]
*  no longer of use. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=203.23999999999998s)]
*  But we do want to see this conflict contained. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=205.18s)]
*  Of course, we will always choose to respond at a time and place of our choosing. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=208.34s)]
*  How do you contain this conflict with Iran's dirty hands in the mix? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=214.94s)]
*  Well, that's difficult, to say the least. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=219.64s)]
*  I mean, this should have been contained before it even started by continuing with all the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=222.28s)]
*  different kinds of economic sanctions on Iran in the first place. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=226.04s)]
*  So going back to it didn't even need to start. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=229.48s)]
*  But now that we are here, one of the best ways to contain it is to send a message to [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=233.07999999999998s)]
*  Iran and other countries around the region that says, at least from the American's perspective, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=237.48s)]
*  if you mess with our people, injure them or kill them in any way, shape or form, you're [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=242.04s)]
*  going to pay a heavy price. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=245.56s)]
*  And that message needs to be bold and it needs to be strong and it needs to be fast. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=248.4s)]
*  Right now what we're doing, bombing empty facilities, is almost fruitless. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=252.12s)]
*  They'll let us do that all day long and they won't change anything that they're doing. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=257.88s)]
*  The fact that Iran is in Lebanon shows that their hand is continuing to basically make [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=261.64s)]
*  all the decisions on behalf of these, what I call, mercenary armies. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=267.04s)]
*  Yep. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=270.88s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel Darren Gobb, thank you very much. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=271.88s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeW__xUUNas&t=273.6s)]
