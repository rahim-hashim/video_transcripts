# Biden ‘once again’ is focused on the ‘completely wrong place’: Expert
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [August 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0)
*  Meanwhile, as tensions in the area grow overnight, a Palestinian attacker killing two and wounding [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=0.0s)]
*  two more in a stabbing spree in Tel Aviv right in the middle of the day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=5.78s)]
*  As up in the north, Americans are urged to leave Lebanon immediately. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  R.E.A. Lightstone served as a senior advisor to the former U.S. ambassador to Israel. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=15.16s)]
*  He joins us now. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=21.5s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=22.5s)]
*  I want to go first to this phone call that's being reported by Axios, where apparently [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=24.0s)]
*  Biden is urging Netanyahu or even scolding Netanyahu as though that it's all on Israel [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=29.0s)]
*  to end this war. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=35.36s)]
*  What's your reaction to that? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, as I commented on Axios just when that call was reported, when Axios reports something [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=38.6s)]
*  from a phone call in between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu, it's what the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=45.36s)]
*  Biden administration wants to leak. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=49.18s)]
*  That's happened for the last three and a half years. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=51.56s)]
*  That's their method of choice. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  I commented at that point in time was, I wish, I really wish that the president of the United [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=55.64s)]
*  States of America spoke to our enemies as clearly and as directly as he does to our [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=60.400000000000006s)]
*  allies. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=65.48s)]
*  He's focused once again completely and totally on the wrong place. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=66.48s)]
*  Instead of being forceful against Iran, he pressures our democratic ally Israel. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=70.12s)]
*  Yeah, part of this report, and like I said, it's being reported, is that Biden told Benjamin [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=74.72s)]
*  Netanyahu that the U.S. would not come to their aid if Israel escalated the situation. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=80.36s)]
*  How do you parse what escalating the situation is as opposed to responding? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=85.02s)]
*  We saw what happened to the Druze in the north, the atrocity that happened there. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=89.52s)]
*  You have to respond to that. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=94.36s)]
*  How does the Biden administration dictate what Israel's escalation based on what may [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=96.68s)]
*  come back from Lebanon or even other places? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=101.25999999999999s)]
*  Your point is exactly correct. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=106.2s)]
*  What does that mean, escalation? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=107.74s)]
*  Hezbollah started fighting this war on October 8th. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=109.08s)]
*  Hamas began the war on October 7th. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=111.88s)]
*  There was a ceasefire on October 6th. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=114.32s)]
*  So all of this has been at the fault of the Iranian proxies. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=116.72s)]
*  The number one funder of the Iranian proxies has been the Biden administration. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=119.96s)]
*  And they have a separate issue, which is they can't win an election because there's a Hamas [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=124.72s)]
*  wing of the Democratic Party. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=129.0s)]
*  And until this war ends and they can pretend that this didn't exist, they won't be able [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=131.82s)]
*  to rally all of their voters in order to be able to win. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=136.52s)]
*  So Biden and Harris are trying to dictate the terms of Israel's existential fight for [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=139.2s)]
*  its existence. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=144.68s)]
*  You can imagine last Saturday night, we found out there were 12 kids murdered playing soccer [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=146.48s)]
*  in Israel. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=152.52s)]
*  And then over the course of the week, Israel successfully eliminated three arch terrorists, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=153.96s)]
*  one of them responsible for the deaths of over 240 Americans in 1983. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=159.04s)]
*  And the U.S. decides to tell Israel to take it down a notch. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=165.24s)]
*  We're backwards here. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=169.04000000000002s)]
*  You know, President Trump reported yesterday, I think a few days ago, he was giving a speech [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=170.04000000000002s)]
*  and he said that Kamala Harris doesn't have support from what he called the Palestinian [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=174.04000000000002s)]
*  wing of her party. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  He said they probably support him because he's going to bring peace to the Middle East. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=180.12s)]
*  Now I understand what he's saying there, but do the people of Gaza or do the people even [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=183.36s)]
*  in this country protesting, is it peace that they want or is it getting rid of Israel that [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=187.84s)]
*  they want? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=191.52s)]
*  No, I think President Trump there was speaking about people who care about the Palestinian [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  people absolutely should support President Trump, because the greatest thing for the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=197.12s)]
*  Palestinian people would be the elimination of Hamas and the rest of the terror organizations. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=201.22s)]
*  If you look at President Trump's track record, five peace treaties during his term between [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=205.84s)]
*  Israel and Arab and Muslim majority countries, if you look at those countries, they all, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=210.36s)]
*  with the exception of Sudan, have progressed meaningfully in these past four years. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=215.16000000000003s)]
*  If you look in the last three and a half years under the Biden-Harris administration, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=219.56s)]
*  only two peace treaties have been conducted, one in between Iran and Saudi Arabia, brokered [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=224.32s)]
*  by China, the other in between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas also brokered by China. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=229.52s)]
*  I can only imagine Israel wants peace. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=235.16s)]
*  I think that's the pursuit of the government there and I hope that we find it soon. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=237.28s)]
*  R.E.A. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=241.32s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pvtv5JFTX0&t=242.32s)]
