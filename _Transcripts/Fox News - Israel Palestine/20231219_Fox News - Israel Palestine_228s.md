# Israel signals readiness to enter into another cease-fire negotiation
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPUceXDckA)
*  Another Fox News alert for you here. The Pentagon launching a 10-nation maritime security operation [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPUceXDckA&t=0.0s)]
*  to fight drone and missile attacks by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen targeting tankers and [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPUceXDckA&t=6.0s)]
*  cargo ships in the Red Sea. It's a big issue. Welcome to a brand new hour of America's [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPUceXDckA&t=11.82s)]
*  Newsroom. I'm Dana Perino. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPUceXDckA&t=16.16s)]
*  Good morning, partner. Nice to see you. I'm Bill Hemmer. Good morning at home. The attacks [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPUceXDckA&t=17.16s)]
*  in the Red Sea are a growing threat to global commerce, forcing international shippers to [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPUceXDckA&t=20.44s)]
*  avoid the dangerous but vital waterway by going south of South Africa's Cape of Good [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPUceXDckA&t=26.8s)]
*  Hope, a much longer and much more expensive journey, clearly. Defense Secretary Lloyd [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPUceXDckA&t=33.42s)]
*  Austin earlier condemning the Houthi attacks as reckless and unacceptable. All countries [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPUceXDckA&t=37.52s)]
*  have the right to move freely and lawfully in international waters, but that foundational [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPUceXDckA&t=43.66s)]
*  global right is under new threat today. These reckless Houthi attacks are a serious international [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPUceXDckA&t=52.04s)]
*  problem and they demand a firm international response. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPUceXDckA&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  Trey Yanks live in Tel Aviv for us this morning. Hi, Trey. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPUceXDckA&t=65.24s)]
*  Hey, Dana. Good morning. I do want to start with some breaking news here, just crossing [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPUceXDckA&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  the wires right now. Israel's President Isaac Herzog signaling a readiness for Israel to [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPUceXDckA&t=75.2s)]
*  enter into another ceasefire negotiation likely mediated by the Qataris if it does include [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPUceXDckA&t=81.12s)]
*  hostages being released from Gaza. Herzog telling a group of ambassadors this today, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPUceXDckA&t=87.56s)]
*  again, signaling that Israel is open to the negotiations that are ongoing as we speak. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPUceXDckA&t=93.2s)]
*  It is day 74 of the war between Israel and Hamas. And while the focus is in Gaza for [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPUceXDckA&t=98.72s)]
*  the Israelis, the entire Middle East looking at what comes next for the region. There is [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPUceXDckA&t=103.96s)]
*  an understanding on the ground that the threats from places like Yemen, Syria and even Iraq [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPUceXDckA&t=108.36s)]
*  will continue by these Iranian backed militias. We also understand after that visit to Tel [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPUceXDckA&t=113.16s)]
*  Aviv yesterday, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced Operation Prosperity Guardian, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPUceXDckA&t=118.44s)]
*  a U.S.-led 10-country coalition, to specifically address growing threats in the Red Sea. The [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPUceXDckA&t=123.76s)]
*  agreement will aim to ensure freedom of navigation in the area and to counter missile and drone [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPUceXDckA&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  attacks from Houthi rebels in Yemen. Now, we do know that two additional attacks took place [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPUceXDckA&t=133.9s)]
*  against commercial vessels late last night. That, according to CENTCOM. After arriving in Qatar [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPUceXDckA&t=138.78s)]
*  today, Secretary of Defense Austin said this about the evolving threat specifically from Yemen. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPUceXDckA&t=143.86s)]
*  This partnership is not just, it's built not just on respect but on trust. And our [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPUceXDckA&t=148.5s)]
*  military will continue working together to increase their armability and to support regional security. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPUceXDckA&t=157.42s)]
*  Here in Israel, the focus for the military and government remains on getting the hostages out [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPUceXDckA&t=164.45999999999998s)]
*  of Gaza. On Monday, CIA Director William Burns met with Israeli and Qatari officials in Warsaw, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPUceXDckA&t=172.7s)]
*  Poland. The aim of that meeting, trying to get a new hostage deal in exchange for another ceasefire [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPUceXDckA&t=177.89999999999998s)]
*  and the release of Palestinian prisoners. Again, that news we are getting in this hour. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPUceXDckA&t=183.18s)]
*  Isaac Herzog, the country's president, indicating the Israelis are open to such a deal. This after [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPUceXDckA&t=187.02s)]
*  the deaths of two additional Israeli soldiers were announced today, bringing the total since [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPUceXDckA&t=192.22000000000003s)]
*  the ground operation began to 131 Israeli troops. Here in Tel Aviv, the families of the 129 people [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPUceXDckA&t=196.46s)]
*  still held inside Gaza once again are calling on the military and government to implement some sort [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPUceXDckA&t=203.66000000000003s)]
*  of temporary ceasefire and get their loved ones out of Gaza. Dana? All right, Trey Yanks, thank you. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPUceXDckA&t=209.26s)]
