# Israel-Hamas war is having a devastating impact, and we want it to end: Dem rep
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [June 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc)
*  All right, this crowd's building fast outside the White House here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=0.0s)]
*  They surround the White House for Gaza. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=3.48s)]
*  The president, as I told you, is not there. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=5.72s)]
*  He's half a world away in Paris. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=7.08s)]
*  But the bottom line is this is a movement that has continued to build pretty much worldwide [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  more in favor of Palestinians than Israelis. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=13.6s)]
*  Congressman Adam Smith, a Washington Democrat, sits on the House Armed Services Committee. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=15.68s)]
*  Very smart guy, his read on all of this. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=20.76s)]
*  I mean, I'm wondering, Congress, always good to have you. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=22.68s)]
*  These protests continue and the odd diversified news here, we get the release of these four [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=25.46s)]
*  hostages today. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=31.700000000000003s)]
*  Good news on that front, yet Israelis continue to get pounded on this war. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=33.620000000000005s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=38.78s)]
*  Look, there's a whole bunch of different layers to it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=40.38s)]
*  I think the overarching thing is you see the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, which is undeniable, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=43.86s)]
*  and I think all of us want that to stop. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=48.540000000000006s)]
*  I think that motivates a lot of people. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=51.14s)]
*  Then there's a lot of other political reasons for it as well. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=53.78s)]
*  I mean, there's been a strong anti-Israel bias for a long time for a lot of different [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=56.14s)]
*  reasons, and you see that playing out across the media as well. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=60.86s)]
*  But I think the overarching policy focus is how do we stop the war in Gaza and build a [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=64.66s)]
*  more secure Middle East? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=70.16s)]
*  I think there's a lot of very strong feelings about that, even as you have people from a [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=71.74000000000001s)]
*  variety of different perspectives. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=75.78s)]
*  We've seen some of the worst, some anti-Semitic approaches, some other approaches that I think [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=77.54s)]
*  are an effort to silence and intimidate opposition. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=83.38s)]
*  So it's a lot of different people for a lot of different reasons. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=87.61999999999999s)]
*  But I come back to the fact that the war is having a devastating impact, and we all want [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=89.89999999999999s)]
*  it to end. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=93.89999999999999s)]
*  And it doesn't look any close to that. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=94.89999999999999s)]
*  I do want to get your sense of what you read a lot in the Israeli press, sir, that this [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=97.02s)]
*  relationship they have with Joe Biden is among the most tense and coolest post-World War [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=103.69999999999999s)]
*  II. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=111.46s)]
*  The post-World War II, the post-Formation of Israel itself. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=112.53999999999999s)]
*  Do you agree with that? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=114.82s)]
*  I don't. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=116.78s)]
*  I mean, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, they both blocked aid to Israel over disagreements. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=117.78s)]
*  I think the first one was a... [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=123.61999999999999s)]
*  No, you're right about that. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=124.61999999999999s)]
*  They didn't do so in real time and publicize it to the world. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=125.61999999999999s)]
*  We found out later. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=128.34s)]
*  Well, in fact, I don't know about the history or the details of that. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=129.34s)]
*  But the other thing is, look, Joe Biden has supported Israel unequivocally from the start [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=133.42s)]
*  of this war. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=137.26s)]
*  We have continued to supply Israel with aid. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=138.26s)]
*  When Iran attacked, we marshaled the forces that helped protect them. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=140.54s)]
*  Whatever the back and forth may be between Netanyahu and Joe Biden on the policy, Joe [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=145.62s)]
*  Biden has supported Israel. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=150.9s)]
*  Now there is one... [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=152.62s)]
*  So what do you think what Nancy Pelosi said didn't mean to interrupt your conversation? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=153.62s)]
*  She doesn't think it's proper for Benjamin Netanyahu when he comes here to speak before [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=155.94s)]
*  Congress. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=161.14s)]
*  What did you think of that? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=162.14s)]
*  I think that's all a distraction as to whether or not he speaks. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=163.14s)]
*  The focus should be on what is the long-term peace in the Middle East. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=167.5s)]
*  And this is the main bone of contention. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=171.3s)]
*  There is at the moment not a reasonable alternative to Hamas. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=173.7s)]
*  And we need a reasonable alternative to Hamas amongst the Palestinian people. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=177.9s)]
*  And Netanyahu has had a policy for 15 years of undermining any effort to build a reasonable [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=181.66s)]
*  alternative to Hamas. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=187.22s)]
*  That is the main point of contention. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=189.04s)]
*  It is Netanyahu's opinion that Israel can never be safe if there is a Palestinian state. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=190.98s)]
*  I and Joe Biden disagree. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=196.46s)]
*  We think the opposite is true. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=197.98000000000002s)]
*  If there is no future for the Palestinians, that's when Israel will not be safe. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=199.78s)]
*  That is the source of the tension. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=204.26000000000002s)]
*  As you know, Netanyahu wants Hamas obliterated. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=205.70000000000002s)]
*  Do you want Hamas obliterated? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=209.14000000000001s)]
*  Everybody wants Hamas obliterated. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=212.18s)]
*  You're okay with that, but then whoever they find in its place, how do you know it won't [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=214.3s)]
*  be another Hamas? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=217.9s)]
*  Well, you have to work towards an alternative. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=219.38s)]
*  You kill a whole bunch of Hamas people but have no alternative. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=223.26s)]
*  Don't support the Palestinian Authority. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=227.5s)]
*  Don't help them develop. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=229.54s)]
*  Then either Hamas or Islamic Jihad or something just as bad will prop up in its place. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=231.14s)]
*  We need a reasonable alternative. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=236.7s)]
*  And I do not agree that there's no Palestinians that we can work with. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=238.66s)]
*  I don't agree with that. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=243.18s)]
*  I think we have to find them in order to get to a more peaceful and stable Middle East. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=244.5s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=248.73999999999998s)]
*  Congressman, very good catching up with you. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=249.73999999999998s)]
*  Adam Smith, the beautiful state of Washington, sits on the House Armed Services Committee. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=251.5s)]
*  We'll see how this goes. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=255.22s)]
*  Again, it's expected to be peaceful but expected to be crowded. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=256.22s)]
*  It's beautiful weather there, so that is what they call, well, protest weather. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=259.14s)]
*  Hopefully friendly weather at that. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpokKREsDc&t=263.62s)]
