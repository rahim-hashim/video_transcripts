# BREAKING: Israel approves plan to capture all of Gaza
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ)
*  And Israel approving a plan to capture all of Gaza the Associated Press says the IDF is tapping tens of thousands of reserves in order to do [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=0.0s)]
*  So meanwhile the Jewish state is promising a stern response to yesterday's missile attack from Yemen on the airport near Tel Aviv [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  General Jack Keane is with us now and [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=15.32s)]
*  They we were just talking in the break. There's always something going on in the world [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=18.6s)]
*  But in this part of the world Israel continues to fight on multiple fronts [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=22.64s)]
*  They still have hostages that they're trying to deal with [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=26.439999999999998s)]
*  Capturing Gaza in the midst of all of this with the Houthis attacking their airport. How do you see it, sir? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=28.68s)]
*  Yeah, well what's what's really taking place here certainly is General Zemir came in on March the 5th and [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=36.04s)]
*  He presented a new plan to the Prime Minister [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=42.959999999999994s)]
*  Credit that the previous chief of the Israeli Defense Forces for killing [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  You know somewhere in a neighborhood of two-thirds 75% of the Hamas fighters [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=52.14s)]
*  But there's still several thousand left and they did that in the past by conducting raids and then moving on to [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=57.86s)]
*  Another area where they're Hamas fighters General Zemir's plan is to take territory and then [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=65.06s)]
*  Kill the Hamas or capture them in that territory and depose them from any [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=72.7s)]
*  Future ability to have political control of Gaza. That's the end state they recognize full [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=77.89999999999999s)]
*  Well, if they're not able to do that [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=84.74s)]
*  It'd be impossible for them to leave Gaza and turn it over to some international force [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=86.78s)]
*  That would be willing to provide security for a new [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=92.7s)]
*  Palestinian like government all of that obviously is still circumspect and no decisions have been made [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=97.42s)]
*  But from a military perspective [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=103.62s)]
*  What is happening here is to finish off Hamas once and for all so they cannot [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=105.94s)]
*  Have any political ability to control Gaza in the future. What did you make of that? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=111.66s)]
*  Attack on the airport. I just want to show for everybody here [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=117.86s)]
*  Israel has an iron dome and we can put it up here on the screen for everybody see how it works [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=120.34s)]
*  So, obviously, you know this very well [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=125.14s)]
*  Which is this is a way to intercept these missiles that are coming through but one got through and hit the airport [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=127.18s)]
*  Yeah, they have three systems [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=134.3s)]
*  the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=136.9s)]
*  Iron dome defense is rockets against rockets and missiles and and the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=138.18s)]
*  Then the midcourse is David sling and that's kind of mid course missiles some cruise missiles [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=144.5s)]
*  And then the most advanced ballistic missiles are defeated by arrow and also our THAAD [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=150.46s)]
*  Missile system, which the United States has given Israel those two [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=157.82s)]
*  systems fail the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=162.5s)]
*  Arrow defense system and the THAAD missile system and is this missile was able to penetrate the airport and it also a similar missile [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=164.5s)]
*  Penetrated Tel Aviv in December. So obviously the air the Israelis are doing an autopsy on this what happened? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=172.82000000000002s)]
*  Why do they have failure? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=178.94s)]
*  But remember we take it for granted that if a missile is flying we can knock it down because we've seen that technology [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=180.14000000000001s)]
*  Time and time again, but there's always misses and we don't really account for the misses very much unless there's casualties [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=186.86s)]
*  As a result of it, right? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=193.86s)]
*  But nobody killed it has been so successful there is a rendering of a possible golden dome system [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=195.86s)]
*  Here in the United States that we can show for everybody [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=203.46s)]
*  This would be kind of a similar concept if you can pull that up and everybody can see this would be the idea of is [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=205.98000000000002s)]
*  You know that some sort of sort of protection. Do you like that? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=211.38s)]
*  Sort of protection. Do you like this idea? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=214.82s)]
*  Well, first of all, it's desirable to have a new concept to deal with where technology is going [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=219.1s)]
*  We can deal with point defenses what essentially Israel is dealing with there in other words [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=227.02s)]
*  Defend Washington DC, which we're currently doing defending the West Coast [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=232.74s)]
*  Against the North Korean missile attack ballistic missile attack, which we're currently doing we can do more of that on the ground than the United States [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=236.82s)]
*  Not cheap, obviously, but the real threat is coming from hypersonic glide missiles in the summer of 21 [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=243.86s)]
*  China launched what's called apologize for the term fractional orbital bombardment system [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=251.34s)]
*  Hypersonic missile that was launched off the coast of China [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=257.7s)]
*  Circum navigated the globe in the southern hemisphere and came back to China while we knew it launched [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=261.38s)]
*  We could not track any of it [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=267.34000000000003s)]
*  So being we can't track it we can't kill it and [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=269.22s)]
*  Advanced cruise missiles are getting to the point where their range is increasing and likely they may have the capability to do much the same [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=272.62s)]
*  So given that technology, how do we defend against that? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=279.7s)]
*  The answer is in space the point defense system that I just described prior cannot do that [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=283.18s)]
*  So you need sensors in space you need? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=289.78000000000003s)]
*  Interceptors in space that means weapons on satellites to do all of that and you need a lot of them because you're [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=292.9s)]
*  Dealing with the globe you're not just dealing with [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=299.18s)]
*  IBM missile coming from Russia or China in the northern hemisphere [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=303.5s)]
*  These things can circumnavigate the globe and when they get back into the Earth's orbit [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=307.3s)]
*  They're moving at a five times the speed of sound which is very difficult to defeat even in the Earth's orbit [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=311.98s)]
*  So desirable the big question mark is it feasible? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=319.18s)]
*  We've got to do the research and [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=323.14000000000004s)]
*  Analysis to make certain of that [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=326.06s)]
*  Before we pour a lot of money at it listen [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=328.1s)]
*  This is a presidential priority and it has worthiness and desirability [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=331.02000000000004s)]
*  But we got to be careful how far we go before we dump a lot of money on it [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=335.94s)]
*  We're all going to already going to put 25 billion on it to get us started in this it could cost [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=340.56s)]
*  Hundreds, but we've got to make certain that it is feasible [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=346.5s)]
*  And I think the administration obviously is aware of that [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=350.94s)]
*  Secretary Hicks that's in the Defense Department is aware of that [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=354.65999999999997s)]
*  I talked to officials about this last week on this very subject. So yes, this is a desirable program [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=357.46s)]
*  It's in concept and theory phase in terms of its fulfillment [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=363.82s)]
*  And we've got to do the research and development and make sure that it's feasible [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=367.94s)]
*  Such wise thoughts and thank you for joining us on a Monday general. Jack Keane. Thank you [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=372.53999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, great talking to you and [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8_5d_XniQ&t=376.84s)]
