# IDF ground forces expanding operations
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI)
*  Alright, on the breaking news, let's get back to Trey Yanksties live in southern Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=0.0s)]
*  What's happening now, Trey? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=4.4s)]
*  Yeah, John Sandra, good afternoon. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  I just want to describe to you what it's like on the ground. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=9.4s)]
*  We're getting a lot of mixed reports from inside Gaza and the possibility of Israeli [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=12.36s)]
*  troops being engaged by those Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=17.56s)]
*  I just want to stop talking for a moment. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=21.88s)]
*  You can hear behind me the engines of APCs. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=27.8s)]
*  Israeli troops are on the move here along the Gaza border and it is a new piece of critical [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=32.92s)]
*  information in all of this. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=37.28s)]
*  It's getting louder and louder as they go up the road over this ridge behind us, but [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=40.0s)]
*  it's an indication that these troops are moving closer to the border. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=43.96s)]
*  They are headed, according to Daniel Higari, the spokesman for the Israeli military into [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=47.68s)]
*  Gaza for limited raids. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=52.8s)]
*  Again, the Israeli military says what is happening tonight is not the full-scale operation into [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=55.2s)]
*  Gaza, but again, we can only report what we have and that is according to the Israeli [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=60.84s)]
*  military. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=65.32s)]
*  With that said, the artillery fire along the border continues, as do the airstrikes. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=66.48s)]
*  The Israelis for the past several hours have been hammering the northern part of Gaza. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=71.12s)]
*  We are working around the clock to try to get you more information from inside the strip, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=75.78s)]
*  Despite the fact that cell service is down for local Palestinian services from the Jawal [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=80.04s)]
*  network, we are talking with Palestinians who have foreign SIM cards and are able to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=86.60000000000001s)]
*  bounce their phones off of Israeli cell towers. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=92.08000000000001s)]
*  So I'm texting with someone who is inside Gaza right now. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=95.44000000000001s)]
*  This individual is in the central part of the Gaza strip, not in Gaza City behind me, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=98.56s)]
*  and he is talking about the situation inside, saying they can hear the airstrikes, but where [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=103.42s)]
*  he is located in the central part of Gaza, there are no airstrikes. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=108.08000000000001s)]
*  Another indication this is focused on the northern part of the Gaza strip. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=112.08000000000001s)]
*  He continues to say that the situation is difficult and asking questions just about [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=115.72s)]
*  what's happening. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=122.72s)]
*  There's a lot of confusion inside Gaza with the cell towers down for local Palestinian [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  SIM cards and questions for the more than two million civilians that are currently inside [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=129.68s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=134.3s)]
*  Again, the latest that we can report, John and Sandra, is that the artillery along the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=135.46s)]
*  border continues as do the airstrikes. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=138.62s)]
*  There are a movement of troops behind us. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=141.54000000000002s)]
*  The Israelis, it appears, are entering the Gaza strip, and what we can confirm is a limited [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=144.14000000000001s)]
*  ground operation. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=150.14000000000001s)]
*  That's tank fire going into Gaza. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=152.10000000000002s)]
*  I'm not sure if you could see any of that, but you can hear the blast and the ground [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=153.94s)]
*  shaking here. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=158.5s)]
*  It gives you a sense of just how close we are to the battle that is unfolding behind [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=159.5s)]
*  us. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=164.7s)]
*  John, Sandra? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=165.7s)]
*  We can certainly hear that. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=166.7s)]
*  Wow, Trey. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=167.7s)]
*  Definitely different than what we've been hearing. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=168.7s)]
*  Yeah, Trey, I was about to ask you that we could hear some firing. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=170.7s)]
*  I didn't know if it was tank fire, mortars, or artillery, but clearly that was a fairly [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=173.66s)]
*  large blast. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=179.78s)]
*  We just heard from John Kirby a few minutes ago who said that the United States would [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=181.54s)]
*  support a pause in the military operations in order to get aid to the Palestinians in [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=186.86s)]
*  Gaza and as well try to make some headway on hostages. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=192.42000000000002s)]
*  It would seem like a pause is not something that Israel is entertaining at this moment, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=197.5s)]
*  at least. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=202.02s)]
*  It doesn't seem so, and when we spoke with Israel's Defense Minister, Yoav Galant, earlier [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=205.46s)]
*  today in Tel Aviv, he discussed this. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=210.18s)]
*  Like I said earlier, much of the conversation was off the record, but a lot of it we were [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=213.45999999999998s)]
*  able to get approved so that we could report this information. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=218.85999999999999s)]
*  One of the four points for the Israelis, one of their main objectives in all of this as [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=223.27999999999997s)]
*  the war is about to enter its 22nd day, is to get those hostages out of Gaza. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=228.26s)]
*  I just saw a flash there, likely more tank fire. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=235.17999999999998s)]
*  It gives you a sense of how close we are here. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=242.14s)]
*  We are right on the edge of the battle here. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=244.26s)]
*  And again, rocket fire is continuing into southern Israel. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=248.01999999999998s)]
*  The airstrikes continue along the border, and these tanks that are clearly just over [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=252.22s)]
*  the ridge from us are now firing into the Gaza Strip. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=257.58s)]
*  So we're talking about airstrikes, artillery, tank fire. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=261.21999999999997s)]
*  And just to give you a sense of what it's like here in southern Israel, a few moments [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=265.46s)]
*  ago, and you can hear the movement of those troops now, a few moments ago we took fire [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=269.16s)]
*  here and it was likely rocket fire. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=273.32000000000005s)]
*  We couldn't hear the whizz of mortars, so probably short-range rockets that the factions [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=275.88000000000005s)]
*  inside Gaza are still firing into Israeli territory. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=280.44s)]
*  You have about 10 seconds to respond here. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=284.16s)]
*  There were sirens sounding in this location. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=286.34000000000003s)]
*  And as we ran to the shelter, explosions rocked the area, and local authorities told us minutes [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=289.18s)]
*  after that there were two direct impacts in this location. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=295.34000000000003s)]
*  Trey, I want to read right off the wires for you. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=299.6s)]
*  Jordan's foreign minister says Israel just launched ground war on Gaza. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=303.12s)]
*  Outcome will be humanitarian catastrophe of epic proportions. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=309.4s)]
*  That is Jordan's foreign minister a moment ago. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=314.48s)]
*  Also the White House's John Kirby has been speaking. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=317.26s)]
*  He would not comment directly on the latest actions by Israel into Gaza, but he just said [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=320.15999999999997s)]
*  we will continue to have discussions with Israel about the manner they're doing this. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=325.62s)]
*  He said we are confident that we can protect our troops and this. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=330.5s)]
*  He just said in this gaggle, the U.S. will not draw red lines for Israel. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=334.62s)]
*  Trey. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=342.7s)]
*  Yeah, look, there's a lot going on behind the scenes here politically in all of this, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=343.7s)]
*  and that was a lot of what the conversation just... [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=351.78000000000003s)]
*  I'm going to get out of the frame here so that you can see. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=354.46000000000004s)]
*  So what you're looking at there, cluster munitions, probably 155 millimeter fired by that artillery [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=357.46000000000004s)]
*  that you could hear in the distance. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=366.02000000000004s)]
*  And so when that happens, it rains down here. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=367.98s)]
*  That artillery is made... [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=370.5s)]
*  The rounds are made in the United States. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=373.06s)]
*  And it's the same artillery actually that the Americans are providing to Ukraine. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=375.46000000000004s)]
*  And so this is... [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=380.54s)]
*  It gives you a sense of the scene here. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=382.22s)]
*  The Israelis, as we speak, are shelling the Gaza Strip with artillery units along the border. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=384.18s)]
*  That's the explosion you heard right there. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=388.3s)]
*  In the distance, if you hear any smaller explosions, that's the Israeli Navy hammering the Gaza... [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=390.46s)]
*  The western side of Gaza. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=395.78s)]
*  Israeli Air Force is hitting targets along the northern part of the Gaza Strip. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=397.58s)]
*  And that artillery continues with the tank fire that you've seen go off behind me. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=402.34s)]
*  And so clearly something is happening tonight, and we continue to cite the Israeli military [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=406.18s)]
*  and what they have told us. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=411.66s)]
*  And they have told us they are conducting expanded ground raids into Gaza. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=412.9s)]
*  We don't want to speculate or call this for what it could be because we need to wait and [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=417.46s)]
*  we need to be patient here. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=422.14s)]
*  But this is unlike any other night we have covered. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=423.5s)]
*  We've been out here for the past 21 days covering this as it unfolds. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=426.14s)]
*  And this is a significant development. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=431.06s)]
*  Also to give you a sense of the phases here, this is indicative of what we expected to [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=433.5s)]
*  come next. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=438.5s)]
*  The Israelis told us they would be ramping up their strikes against Gaza before entering [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=439.58s)]
*  on the ground. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=444.06s)]
*  This is referred to in military terms as softening the target. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=445.06s)]
*  And when we met with the defense minister in Tel Aviv tonight, he laid out this plan [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=448.34s)]
*  and how it's going to look moving forward. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=452.5s)]
*  And when I asked him directly, and you could tell this is wearing on him, this is a massive [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=454.9s)]
*  ground war that is unfolding here and there are concerns. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=460.78s)]
*  It's not just going to be in the south, but activity on the northern border with Lebanon [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=463.38s)]
*  and the entire region. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=466.82s)]
*  But I asked him how long this is going to take. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=468.42s)]
*  And he told me it is not a question of weeks, it is a question of months. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=470.98s)]
*  Hey, Trey, I wanted to ask you one other question. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=479.26s)]
*  We talked about this a little bit last hour. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=481.42s)]
*  And that is the fact that the IDF really has focused a lot of attention on the Al-Shifa [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=484.14000000000004s)]
*  hospital, which it insists is the headquarters for Hamas, that underneath the hospital there [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=488.90000000000003s)]
*  is a labyrinth of basements and sub-basements, which Hamas uses as its headquarters. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=495.14s)]
*  But they have been tweeting about Al-Shifa. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=501.74s)]
*  They had an elaborate presentation today with computer graphics representative of what they [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=504.38s)]
*  say is the underground complex. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=509.58s)]
*  It would seem to me that that is laying the predicate for Israel to go after elements [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=512.42s)]
*  of that hospital, if not the hospital itself. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=521.18s)]
*  Have you heard any word there that the IDF is going to try to get that hospital evacuated [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=525.26s)]
*  or may go after it? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=532.9s)]
*  What's this information program about that they're launching regarding that hospital? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=535.06s)]
*  Yeah, John, it's a good question. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=539.8599999999999s)]
*  Just to give you some background on the Al-Shifa hospital, it's the largest hospital inside [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=543.62s)]
*  and it sits in the middle of Gaza City. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=549.18s)]
*  Many of the images that we brought you over the past week, especially the images we brought [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=551.78s)]
*  you following the hospital explosion at a separate hospital in northern Gaza, were from [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=555.62s)]
*  Al-Shifa because they brought the bodies of those killed in that Palestinian Islamic Jihad [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=561.0999999999999s)]
*  misfire to Al-Shifa. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=565.9s)]
*  I've been to Al-Shifa hospital and I want to describe the layout to you. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=568.14s)]
*  In 2014, during Sukkotan, a 51-day war between Israel and Gaza, I was reporting there and [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=572.78s)]
*  you enter in a main entryway and there is a circle, similar to a traffic circle, where [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=578.0999999999999s)]
*  ambulances will roll in, drop off patients and then go to their next location. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=583.4s)]
*  In the center there, there are many civilians who shelter, especially during conflicts like [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=588.74s)]
*  the one unfolding now. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=592.74s)]
*  And then there's the main hospital building. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=594.7199999999999s)]
*  But around the complex, there are a variety of buildings. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=596.54s)]
*  And one time I actually met with Hamas leadership inside a building. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=599.5s)]
*  This was in 2014 on the Al-Shifa hospital complex. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=603.3000000000001s)]
*  What the Israelis released today was a computer-generated image that shows what they say is a tunnel [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=606.74s)]
*  complex beneath Al-Shifa hospital. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=611.62s)]
*  And when we step back and we think about this, the Israelis want the public to understand [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=614.6600000000001s)]
*  that Hamas is hiding a command center beneath the hospital, according to the Israelis and [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=620.0600000000001s)]
*  the intelligence they have received. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=624.58s)]
*  We have not seen that intelligence. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=626.7800000000001s)]
*  We have only seen what they've told us and the computer-generated image that they claim [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=628.1s)]
*  is beneath the hospital. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=632.98s)]
*  But we know there is an extensive network of tunnels beneath Gaza, especially Gaza City. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=634.22s)]
*  And so whether or not they could hit it or they would tell people to evacuate, we don't [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=639.32s)]
*  know. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=642.62s)]
*  I do want to just give you some new information because my source inside Gaza is texting me [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=643.62s)]
*  as we talk here. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=647.36s)]
*  And I'm just going to read you exactly what he said to me. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=648.86s)]
*  More tank fire into the northern part of Gaza. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=653.3000000000001s)]
*  Again, it shows you just how close we are here. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=657.14s)]
*  You can hear the tanks firing from the ridge that we are standing on into Gaza. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=658.42s)]
*  And it takes a few seconds until the round actually hits its target. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=664.12s)]
*  And then you hear a smaller explosion in the distance. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=667.08s)]
*  Back to what I was saying here, though, about my source inside Gaza. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=669.42s)]
*  More tank fire. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=673.7s)]
*  But the source in the middle part of Gaza, he evacuated south following those warnings [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=674.9s)]
*  by the Israelis. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=679.3s)]
*  And I asked him what the mood is tonight in Gaza. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=680.92s)]
*  He says, unfortunately, no connection to know what's going on. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=682.74s)]
*  Remember, he has a foreign SIM card, so he is bouncing these messages off an Israeli [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=685.5s)]
*  cell tower. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=689.4200000000001s)]
*  There's no local cell signal in Gaza right now. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=690.4200000000001s)]
*  He says, sound is very big and we're scared. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=692.46s)]
*  Gaza tonight is alone. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=695.7800000000001s)]
*  I can't confirm these airstrikes, the targets, people, civilians or hospitals. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=697.62s)]
*  We're trying to reach some people inside Gaza City, but no connection. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=702.4200000000001s)]
*  This is a source that I have used to confirm information about what's happening in Gaza, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=706.22s)]
*  so that is why he's giving me that last part. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=709.94s)]
*  It gives you a sense there are more than two million Palestinian civilians in Gaza not [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=712.54s)]
*  affiliated with Hamas or Islamic Jihad. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=717.02s)]
*  There are also thousands of Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters along the strip. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=719.26s)]
*  That is why this is so complicated, what's taking place. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=723.58s)]
*  But we've got to talk about those civilians in Gaza who are innocent bystanders in all [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=726.1s)]
*  of this, and they are also terrified tonight. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=731.3s)]
*  War is such a terrible thing. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=734.36s)]
*  And when you think about what it is like inside the strip, we've been there when war erupts. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=736.58s)]
*  Not a war this large, though, and the amount of air power hammering Gaza, the artillery [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=740.9s)]
*  in the distance. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=745.5s)]
*  This is the front line of a ground war between Israel and Gaza, and it is going to be incredibly [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=747.22s)]
*  challenging. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=752.9399999999999s)]
*  It will be a bloody urban battle as these Israeli forces enter. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=753.9399999999999s)]
*  And even if this is contained tonight to an extended raid inside the Gaza strip, we are [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=757.5799999999999s)]
*  talking about these Israeli troops being immediately engaged. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=763.26s)]
*  They will not simply roll into Gaza with tanks and APCs. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=766.5s)]
*  They will face a fierce resistance from the factions inside the strip, including Hamas [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=770.8199999999999s)]
*  and Islamic Jihad. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=774.98s)]
*  And there is a battle raging behind us as we speak. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=776.66s)]
*  Trey, obviously, always take safety with your crew. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=779.6999999999999s)]
*  As you see anything come in, we hear it. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=783.22s)]
*  We have seen a lot of it, and it seems to be escalating just the last few minutes. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=785.42s)]
*  I wrote down what you just said, Trey, as we have a few minutes to the top of the hour [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=789.38s)]
*  here, almost 3 o'clock here on the East Coast, almost 10 p.m. there in southern Israel. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=794.14s)]
*  You said in the 21 days that you've been covering this, tonight is unlike any other, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=799.54s)]
*  Trey. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=805.5s)]
*  Obviously, things are changing. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=806.5s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=808.78s)]
*  Things are changing. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=811.6999999999999s)]
*  This is the next phase of the war. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=813.06s)]
*  At this moment, I cannot confirm to you that the ground operation has begun. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=815.86s)]
*  What we can tell you is that a new phase is underway right now as we speak. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=820.24s)]
*  The Israelis are describing that phase as an extension of the raids that were taking [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=826.38s)]
*  place over the past few nights. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=831.2199999999999s)]
*  But this war is entering a phase that we knew it would enter, according to the top intelligence [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=834.78s)]
*  officials we're talking to, not just here on the ground, but also in the United States. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=841.0999999999999s)]
*  We've been trying to get a full picture of what's taking place here. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=844.8199999999999s)]
*  And this was what was described to us as the next step in all of this, increasing the airstrikes, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=848.78s)]
*  pushing in on the ground to test what the resistance would be like for the Israeli soldiers, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=853.9s)]
*  and then ultimately continuing with the plan. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=859.42s)]
*  And that plan, according to the Israeli military and the defense minister, who we talked with [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=862.38s)]
*  face to face today in Tel Aviv, is to completely destroy Hamas. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=866.34s)]
*  And just listen here. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=870.98s)]
*  You can hear those APCs. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=874.54s)]
*  They are headed toward the Gaza Strip as we speak. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=875.74s)]
*  Trey, you've been doing amazing reporting. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=879.06s)]
*  We'll let you get a break because obviously it's going to be a long night where you are. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=883.14s)]
*  Most of the fire, it would seem, is outgoing, which is good, but the chance for incoming [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=888.26s)]
*  fire is always there. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=893.3000000000001s)]
*  So stay safe, my friend. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=894.5400000000001s)]
*  Doing great work. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEY8XltPsI&t=896.1800000000001s)]
