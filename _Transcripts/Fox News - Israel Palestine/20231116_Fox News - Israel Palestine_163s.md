# Trey Yingst enters Gaza hospital with Israeli military
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o)
*  We are back with a Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o&t=0.0s)]
*  Right now we're seeing smoke along the Israel-Gaza border more than 40 days after the war between [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Israel and Hamas began. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o&t=10.24s)]
*  This just hours after IDF released images of weapons found during a raid at the largest [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o&t=12.14s)]
*  hospital in Gaza. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o&t=16.92s)]
*  Trey Yanks live in southern Israel. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o&t=18.64s)]
*  He actually went into that hospital with the IDF. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o&t=20.32s)]
*  Trey, what did you see? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o&t=22.92s)]
*  Todd Carley, good morning. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o&t=26.44s)]
*  Last night we joined Israeli forces in the heart of Gaza City as they continued a raid [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o&t=27.64s)]
*  of Gaza's Al-Shifa hospital. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o&t=33.2s)]
*  The Israelis controlled where we could go and who we could talk to, but it did give [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o&t=35.54s)]
*  us some insight into the situation on the ground. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o&t=39.18s)]
*  Here's a preview of our reporting for later today. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o&t=42.52s)]
*  Nearly three weeks into the ground operation, we are with the Israeli military in the dark [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o&t=47.68s)]
*  of night, headed into the heart of Gaza City. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o&t=52.7s)]
*  The Israelis have been fighting block by block and street by street against Hamas. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o&t=56.72s)]
*  They recently gained control of the Al-Shadi camp in the Al-Shifa hospital. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o&t=60.56s)]
*  You can hear the Israelis are engaged in gun battles here with Hamas. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o&t=72.68s)]
*  Right now we're in Gaza's Al-Shifa hospital. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o&t=80.24s)]
*  It was raided overnight by Israeli forces who were looking for Hamas infrastructure [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o&t=83.0s)]
*  and weapons. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o&t=88.08s)]
*  They are still searching at this hour for the tunnels that they say are beneath the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o&t=89.36s)]
*  hospital, but they did recover weapons they say belong to Hamas in an MRI room. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  Here on one side of the facility, and when you look behind the machine, you see the weapons [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o&t=101.04s)]
*  and ammunition. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o&t=106.68s)]
*  The Israelis say Hamas had ready to go so that they could continue engaging Israeli [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o&t=109.2s)]
*  forces in the heart of Gaza City. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o&t=113.24s)]
*  What we have here is professional Hamas literature, all of it with the official insignia of Hamas. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o&t=116.24s)]
*  And we have here really a mix of tactical brochures for commanders, how to attack a [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o&t=125.19999999999999s)]
*  tank and what type of ammunition to use in what kind of situation. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o&t=131.24s)]
*  The Israelis did not show us any of the tunnels they claim are beneath Gaza's Al-Shifa hospital. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o&t=139.12s)]
*  They did, however, recover some of those small arms in the radiology unit. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o&t=144.8s)]
*  We posed questions to the Israelis about the criticism they faced for raiding a medical [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o&t=148.56s)]
*  facility. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o&t=152.76000000000002s)]
*  They said that no Palestinians were killed during the operation. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o&t=153.76000000000002s)]
*  Todd Carley? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o&t=156.56s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o&t=157.56s)]
*  Trey Yanks, live for us in southern Israel. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o&t=158.56s)]
*  Trey, as always, thank you. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6EPfn7D3_o&t=161.16000000000003s)]
