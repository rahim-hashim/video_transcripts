# Ex-Netanyahu spokeswoman warns US, Israel are dealing with 'irrational' people
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc)
*  We're going to go to Tal Heinrich. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=0.0s)]
*  Tal, how are you? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=2.2600000000000002s)]
*  I'm great, Trey. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=4.16s)]
*  So good to be with you. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=5.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=7.36s)]
*  Let's give us a sense of what's happening in Israel. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=8.56s)]
*  I mean, the United States is lucky. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=13.84s)]
*  We are surrounded by two oceans and friendly neighbors. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=16.42s)]
*  Israel is surrounded by people that desire its non-existence. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=20.38s)]
*  Tell us what life in Israel is like right now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  So I can tell you that just about an hour ago, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=28.22s)]
*  the sirens went off again in central Israel. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=30.88s)]
*  I think it was the second barrage of today. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=33.28s)]
*  And people, I believe your viewers have seen some of the images [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=36.620000000000005s)]
*  because the past week has been full of damage, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=40.44s)]
*  destruction, those big ballistic missiles. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=43.8s)]
*  They cause a lot of trouble for us. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  And Iran, in fact, as we discovered, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=49.18s)]
*  is working to pursue about 20,000 of them [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  within six years. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=57.24s)]
*  So obviously, the nuclear threat, their nuclear aspirations [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=58.5s)]
*  are not the only existential threats to Israel, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=61.9s)]
*  but rather also those ballistic missiles. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=64.98s)]
*  Dozens of Israelis were killed from these strikes [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=67.84s)]
*  over the past week or so. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=73.28s)]
*  And people have to evacuate. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=74.86s)]
*  They run to shelters in the middle of the night [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=77.92s)]
*  with their children. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=79.92s)]
*  They need to pack a bag with their very basic belongings [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=81.0s)]
*  just in case the building will collapse [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=85.22s)]
*  and they will need a rescue. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=87.53999999999999s)]
*  So it's not a sustainable reality. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=88.72s)]
*  But people have to understand that it's not that Israel [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=91.56s)]
*  and the United States escalated the situation [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=94.72s)]
*  by striking and going after the Iranian threat, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=97.7s)]
*  launching this important operation. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  Iran escalated the situation when their crazy regime [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=108.5s)]
*  took power in 1979 and vowed to destroy our nations. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=112.92s)]
*  Yeah, you mentioned the Iranian regime. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=118.72s)]
*  And I don't know why people want to dance around it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=120.86s)]
*  I will not dance. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=123.26s)]
*  Regime changes what is needed in Iran. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=125.4s)]
*  The current regime is never going to recognize Israel. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=128.6s)]
*  And if they do so, you can't trust them. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=131.94s)]
*  It'll be done grudgingly. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=133.74s)]
*  They hate the United States. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=135.52s)]
*  So why is there so much reluctance [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=137.72s)]
*  to talk about empowering the Iranian people [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=140.3s)]
*  to pick their own leaders instead of having a theocracy [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=143.48s)]
*  where they literally put people to death [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=147.24s)]
*  for things that wouldn't be crimes in Israel [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=149.14s)]
*  or in the United States? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=150.98s)]
*  Right, but I don't think we are reluctant to speak about it [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=152.48s)]
*  because we say if that happens, we set the ball in motion. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=155.68s)]
*  That could very much be a result of our actions, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=159.48s)]
*  you know, the very important action, the bold decision [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=162.52s)]
*  that President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu took. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=165.32s)]
*  But it's not one of our war goals. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=168.2s)]
*  The prime minister, I think one of the best things [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=172.28s)]
*  that he has done after October 7th [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=174.14s)]
*  was to set very clear goals of what it would mean [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=176.24s)]
*  to win the war on each and every front that Israel's fighting. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=179.04s)]
*  And in Iran, he said first, of course, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=182.28s)]
*  their nuclear aspirations, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=185.48s)]
*  their nuclear project must be eliminated. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=187.06s)]
*  We have to also take out the threat [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=189.88s)]
*  of those ballistic missiles. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=191.7s)]
*  And they cannot continue to finance [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=192.92s)]
*  and spread their terror all across the region [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=196.16s)]
*  through their proxies. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=198.82s)]
*  So a regime change could very much be the result, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=199.86s)]
*  but it's not the goal. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=203.0s)]
*  But, you know, the prime minister and all Israelis, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=204.44s)]
*  he just recorded a message, I think, over the past week [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=209.28s)]
*  to the Iranian people saying, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=211.70000000000002s)]
*  this is your opportunity right now to stand up, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=213.6s)]
*  take back what was yours, your country. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=216.72s)]
*  Because what did this regime bring to the Iranian people? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=219.02s)]
*  Only misery, you know, a crippling economy [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=222.56s)]
*  while they sent their money all across the region [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=227.82000000000002s)]
*  to spread their crazy fundamentalist agenda. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=230.92000000000002s)]
*  And I think what people here in the West [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=235.36s)]
*  find very difficult to understand, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=238.4s)]
*  and I know that you do, is what Israel is dealing with, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=240.20000000000002s)]
*  what the United States is dealing with. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=243.78s)]
*  These are irrational people. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=245.60000000000002s)]
*  If it's the Iranian leadership [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=248.34s)]
*  or also the Palestinian leadership in Gaza, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=250.12s)]
*  these are irrational people. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=252.34s)]
*  You and I, we will go to sleep tonight. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=253.85999999999999s)]
*  When we wake up in the morning, we want to enjoy our coffee, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=255.48s)]
*  see the smiles on our children's faces. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=258.56s)]
*  But for these people, that's not a top priority. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=260.7s)]
*  A top priority is the destruction of another nation. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=264.3s)]
*  And you can't expect Israel [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=267.74s)]
*  to just accept this existential threat and lose, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=269.53999999999996s)]
*  so that other people could feel morally superior or something. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=273.6s)]
*  That's not how it works. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=277.03999999999996s)]
*  We're not taking any more chances on our security. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=278.2s)]
*  I can tell you that Israel has been patient [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=282.94s)]
*  for a lot longer than the United States would be. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=285.74s)]
*  If we had a neighbor that desired our non-existence, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=288.36s)]
*  they wouldn't be a neighbor very long. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=291.65999999999997s)]
*  So I was in Israel not long ago. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=293.38s)]
*  I think people who haven't visited, it is small. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=295.86s)]
*  It is 1.75 the size of Iran. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=300.52s)]
*  But you proved this week how powerful you are. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=304.15999999999997s)]
*  It's about the size of New Jersey, Trey, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=305.5s)]
*  about the size of New Jersey. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=307.0s)]
*  And Iran is three times, it's like Alaska. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=309.0s)]
*  Maybe twice or three times the size of Texas. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=312.34s)]
*  So, Tol Heinrich, thank you for joining us. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=314.74s)]
*  And we will be watching. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=317.58s)]
*  I cannot imagine living in bomb shelters [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=320.12s)]
*  and listening for sirens to go off. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=322.38s)]
*  But that is the way Israel has had to live [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=324.15999999999997s)]
*  since the inception of that country. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=327.08s)]
*  But, Trey, trust me, good times are ahead. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=329.0s)]
*  Thanks to the president's bold decision [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=332.52s)]
*  and the leadership in Israel of Prime Minister Netanyahu, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=334.52s)]
*  we're heading towards good times, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=337.24s)]
*  and we will be victorious. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=339.2s)]
*  The region will prosper, we'll see less terrorism, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=342.82s)]
*  and we will not agree to live with such existential threats. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=345.22s)]
*  Tol Heinrich, ending with a note of optimism, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=351.20000000000005s)]
*  I hope you're right. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=353.90000000000003s)]
*  Thank you for joining us on a Sunday night. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=354.90000000000003s)]
*  Of course. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgOC9UAUVc&t=356.90000000000003s)]
