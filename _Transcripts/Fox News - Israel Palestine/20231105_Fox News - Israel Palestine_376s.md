# FOX reporter goes inside Gaza
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8)
*  Trey Yngst has just returned from a trip to Gaza yesterday, one of the few reporters taken [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=0.0s)]
*  there by the Israeli military. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=5.74s)]
*  You can hear that gunfire in the distance. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=8.74s)]
*  The Israelis are trying to engage anyone who tries to ambush their forces. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=10.700000000000001s)]
*  And the battle is street by street. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=16.06s)]
*  It is urban guerrilla warfare as Hamas is popping out of tunnels and ambushing Israeli troops. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=17.42s)]
*  Joining us now from Israel is Fox's Trey Yngst. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=25.96s)]
*  And give me the big picture. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=28.76s)]
*  What insight did you gain from actually being able to go to Gaza? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  And were you able to do independent reporting despite the Israeli military escort? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=33.52s)]
*  Yeah, hey, Howie. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=38.08s)]
*  It's a great question. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=40.96s)]
*  And this was an opportunity we've been pushing for since the war began 30 days ago, trying [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=42.260000000000005s)]
*  to get access into the Gaza Strip to see what it looks like and what the operations and [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=47.1s)]
*  the battles are like. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=51.64s)]
*  They're ongoing even at this hour. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=53.3s)]
*  We've been listening as the Israelis launch new airstrikes against Gaza. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=54.94s)]
*  But inside you really got a sense of just how dangerous it is for the Israeli forces. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=58.86s)]
*  We took an armored personnel carrier with the Israelis as they went to a house that [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=63.059999999999995s)]
*  they'd taken over. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=67.38s)]
*  And on the way there you could see on the faces of these Israeli soldiers the concern [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=68.8s)]
*  and the fear. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=72.56s)]
*  We've seen the videos and the understanding that Hamas and Islamic Jihad have anti-tank [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=73.8s)]
*  guided missiles and RPGs. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  And they've been targeting these convoys of soldiers going into Gaza. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=79.96s)]
*  And so those moments in the convoy were probably the most intense. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=83.69999999999999s)]
*  And it was about 15 to 20 minutes on the way in and then 15 to 20 minutes on the way out. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=88.67999999999999s)]
*  We went more than a mile into the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=92.6s)]
*  And when we arrived, we were at a house. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=95.5s)]
*  And within seconds of getting out of the APC, two bullets whizzed past. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=97.96s)]
*  And the Israelis were engaged in a new gun battle with Hamas militants. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=102.39999999999999s)]
*  And so I'd say I took away two major insights. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=106.44s)]
*  One has to do with just how dangerous it is for the Israeli forces. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=109.68s)]
*  And the second is just how deep into Gaza the Israelis are. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=113.08000000000001s)]
*  Howie? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  Do Israelis, and not to mention Israeli officials, recognize that especially with the bombing [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  of the refugee camp and the ambulance convoy, and I know Israel says that these are targeting [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=123.68s)]
*  Hamas terrorists who embed in those areas, but that world opinion and media opinion is [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=131.02s)]
*  growing increasingly critical. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=136.36s)]
*  They're certainly aware of that. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=138.68s)]
*  And these are questions we still have to ask to the Israelis even when we are embedded [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=141.84s)]
*  with their forces. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=145.88s)]
*  And behind me, you can see the airstrikes continue against the northern part of the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=147.4s)]
*  Gaza Strip. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  But in terms of our embed with the Israelis, all of the information that we shoot, the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=152.04000000000002s)]
*  interviews that we do in the video, has to go through the Israeli censor. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=157.12s)]
*  And the censor will argue back and forth saying, we can't show this. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=160.8s)]
*  It gives away too many sensitive military positions. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=163.72s)]
*  And part of our role on the ground is doing all the reporting we can and then fighting [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=166.64s)]
*  back against that. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=170.04s)]
*  We will not budge an inch when it comes to editorial. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=171.04s)]
*  We have to be 100% free to report what we see. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=173.84s)]
*  We're only able to have the conversations when it comes to sensitive information that [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  could lead to the deaths or injuries of Israeli soldiers. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=181.5s)]
*  And so we had a lot of back and forth with the Israelis when we actually came out of [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=184.54s)]
*  Gaza and we had to push them and say, look, this information needs to get out as it is. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=188.12s)]
*  We also had to ask those questions about the rising civilian casualty rate inside Gaza. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=192.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=196.88s)]
*  Well, of course, you know, there are going to be some security restrictions, as you would [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=197.88s)]
*  be if you were with American troops. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=201.35999999999999s)]
*  And it's finally we are getting a firsthand report from you and others about Gaza. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=203.44s)]
*  You told Axios about the war coverage generally that there are certain things we don't talk [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=207.57999999999998s)]
*  about in straight news reports. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=211.96s)]
*  What were you alluding to? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=213.64s)]
*  Just how gruesome the details of this conflict truly are. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=217.96s)]
*  There are things that we will not show on TV because they are too graphic. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=222.12s)]
*  Even descriptions of what was done to the Israelis during the October 7th massacre. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=228.0s)]
*  Just we can't talk about them on TV because they are so graphic. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=232.88s)]
*  And it's important for there to be a record of these atrocities that were committed against [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=236.32s)]
*  the civilian population. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=240.04000000000002s)]
*  But in terms of showing people, it can really it can be a graphic and a traumatic experience [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=241.04000000000002s)]
*  just to even hear about what happened here on the ground. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=250.24s)]
*  And I think that's the smell of death, which really got to me. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=251.36s)]
*  Let's show a brief clip of you covering when you were back in Israel, kind of a dicey moment. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=253.8s)]
*  Guys, we're just we can hear a direct impact. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=260.84000000000003s)]
*  A rocket just slammed into the building right next to where we're at. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=267.08s)]
*  Even by wartime standards, this is a really dangerous assignment, as I don't have to tell [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=272.76s)]
*  you. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=277.28000000000003s)]
*  How do you cope with that? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=278.28000000000003s)]
*  It's incredibly dangerous. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=280.72s)]
*  And the place we're standing right now along the Israel Gaza border, Howie, we have about [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=281.96000000000004s)]
*  10 seconds to get to shelter when an incoming fire happens. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=285.68s)]
*  And you saw in that video the aftermath of a direct hit next to a kindergarten here in [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=289.12s)]
*  southern Israel. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=294.12s)]
*  We quickly got to cover within seconds a huge explosion rocked the outside. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=295.6s)]
*  You could feel the ground shaking. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=299.76000000000005s)]
*  And it was a miracle that no journalists were injured or killed. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=301.70000000000005s)]
*  There were dozens of journalists in this area overlooking the Gaza Strip. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=304.76000000000005s)]
*  In terms of how we deal with it, we just have to have a plan and we have a very clean plan. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=308.3s)]
*  We also have a security team member with us. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=311.9s)]
*  We have our flak jackets and we even have an armored vehicle so that we can use the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=314.21999999999997s)]
*  resources to ensure that we can cover this story but do it in a safe way. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=318.86s)]
*  Because if we're injured or killed, we simply cannot bring this news to our viewers. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=323.06s)]
*  Yes, that would be a loss. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=326.3s)]
*  And I just admire the courageous reporting that you and others are doing. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=328.65999999999997s)]
*  Just very briefly, you're working around the clock, especially with the time difference. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=332.28s)]
*  Don't you get tired? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=336.82s)]
*  I'm tired every day, Howard, but I feel a massive responsibility to be here. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=340.02s)]
*  And so I'm getting up. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=345.02s)]
*  The past 30 days we have been on TV live each and every day bringing the latest on the ground [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=346.02s)]
*  developments to our audience so that they can get a clear picture about what's taking [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=350.22s)]
*  place here in southern Israel. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=353.78000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=354.94s)]
*  That's a great service and stay safe. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=355.94s)]
*  Always good to talk to you. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=358.1s)]
*  Trainings. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=359.1s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISz8cTHm5N8&t=360.1s)]
