# US embassy in Israel restricts travel for staff amid threat from Iran
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU)
*  We're back with a Fox News alert out of the Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel saying it's ready to respond after the United States warns an attack from Iran [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=4.24s)]
*  is imminent and could potentially come within the next 24 hours. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=9.44s)]
*  The U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem just issuing a major security alert for embassy staff [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=12.6s)]
*  and other U.S. citizens in the country. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=17.2s)]
*  An Iranian source also tells the Wall Street Journal that attack plans are being discussed, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=19.900000000000002s)]
*  but no final decision has been made. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=26.0s)]
*  Joey Jones is a Fox News contributor, of course, and he joins us now. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=28.6s)]
*  Joey, good morning to you. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=32.4s)]
*  The situation is tense, to say the least. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=33.4s)]
*  What goes through your mind when you hear all of this? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=36.36s)]
*  Yeah, I think they're tactical and then they're strategic. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=38.800000000000004s)]
*  I think the tactical sense here is that Israel conducted a strike that took out more military [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=43.04s)]
*  leaders for Iran. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=49.08s)]
*  I think the life expectancy of an Iranian military leader is probably as short today [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=50.08s)]
*  as it's ever been when you couple this with what President Trump was able to do. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=53.660000000000004s)]
*  As an American, I zoom out and say, what does this mean for us? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=58.64s)]
*  As a country, we can't fight a war on three fronts, meaning Ukraine, Israel, or the Middle [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=61.64s)]
*  East, and potentially the Pacific or even here at home, which is our greatest concern. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=66.2s)]
*  So obviously, as Americans and someone who's fought a war, we don't want there to be a [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=71.47999999999999s)]
*  larger war in the Middle East, but Israel has to make a calculation. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=75.56s)]
*  The one truth that I do know coming out of the Israel-Hamas war is that an entire generation [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=79.47999999999999s)]
*  of Palestinians have been bred into a lifelong fight to destroy Israel. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=85.12s)]
*  And I know that that makes it sound like it's Israel's fault. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=90.68s)]
*  It's not. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  But any war, any collateral damage in war creates a psychological enemy. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  So they may physically impede or even destroy Hamas. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=98.66000000000001s)]
*  That doesn't mean they take the idea of destroying Israel away from the Palestinian people. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=102.64s)]
*  And one of the better ways to control that is to take their physical support from Iran [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=108.12s)]
*  away. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=112.08000000000001s)]
*  So I think this is tactical. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=113.08000000000001s)]
*  I think it's looking forward. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=114.52000000000001s)]
*  I think it's trying to get to, as Kamala Harris would say, the root of the problem, which [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  is Iran. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=120.52000000000001s)]
*  I just hope that Israel has a plan and has thought this out and that somehow that we [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=121.52000000000001s)]
*  stop escalation in the Middle East from happening because we can't afford as a country in the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=126.80000000000001s)]
*  United States to support a war that gets larger than what it already is in Israel. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=131.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=135.52s)]
*  So when it comes to that calculation that you mentioned, the world and clearly the Biden [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=136.52s)]
*  administration are giving Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a lot of notes, making this very, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=142.08s)]
*  very difficult for him to figure out what he should do. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=146.84s)]
*  But he doesn't seem very confused. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=150.2s)]
*  He seems resolute as to what Israel will do if met with an attack. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=151.72s)]
*  Listen. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=155.84s)]
*  We continue our nonstop efforts to return our hostages. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=159.08s)]
*  But we are also preparing for scenarios of challenges from other arenas. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=162.16s)]
*  We establish a simple principle. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=167.0s)]
*  Whoever hurts us, we hurt him. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=169.0s)]
*  Yeah. So, Joey, there is zero equivocation there. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=171.28s)]
*  What is the response from Israel and from the United States? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=174.08s)]
*  I know you said it's confusing, it's complicated. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=178.04s)]
*  But what is the response from those two powers if Iran attacks in the next 24, 48, 72 hours? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=180.96s)]
*  I think at this point, Todd, it's easier to predict a response from Israel than the United [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=188.68s)]
*  States. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=191.96s)]
*  I think Israel, if they have the weapons and munitions and physical support, will absolutely [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=192.96s)]
*  retaliate if any attack is conducted on the homeland. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=197.68s)]
*  I think one of the biggest concerns now is does Iran attack an asset like an embassy [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=200.6s)]
*  in an Arab nation? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=204.51999999999998s)]
*  Or do they attack somewhere in Israel specific? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  Or do they attack somewhere Israeli troops in Gaza, which kind of keeps it in the gray [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=207.79999999999998s)]
*  area? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  Do they do it through Hezbollah or do they do it with Iranian military forces or missiles [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=213.79999999999998s)]
*  itself? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=217.48s)]
*  I think Israel's response will be very definitive. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=218.68s)]
*  I think they will respond militarily. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=221.68s)]
*  I think the United States is the wild card. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=224.44s)]
*  And to an extent, I understand. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=227.44s)]
*  Simply because if Israel can't fight this war without United States support, the president [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=229.44s)]
*  of the United States does get a say either through diplomacy or through the supply of [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=233.96s)]
*  munitions. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=238.72s)]
*  However, we have a president that waivers. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=239.72s)]
*  We have a president that says one thing and does another. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=242.0s)]
*  And we have a president whose body of work says he'll do anything to not win a war. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=244.48s)]
*  And that's a problem. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=251.07999999999998s)]
*  That's a big problem. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=252.48s)]
*  It's one that I hope we remedy in November, but it's one that really plagues us across [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  the board from our own military readiness to what's happening in Ukraine, what's happening [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=257.44s)]
*  in Israel, and God forbid what could happen in the Pacific. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=262.03999999999996s)]
*  And that is why the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem just issued that major security alert for [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=265.59999999999997s)]
*  embassy staff and other U.S. citizens in the country to try and get out because we just [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=270.76s)]
*  don't know what's going to happen. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=276.59999999999997s)]
*  And if Iran strikes directly and God forbid kills an American citizen, we could be in [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=278.08s)]
*  an entirely new place in this war that we don't want to be in. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=283.36s)]
*  Joey, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=286.84000000000003s)]
*  We do have to leave it there. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAklE4YTMCU&t=288.28000000000003s)]
