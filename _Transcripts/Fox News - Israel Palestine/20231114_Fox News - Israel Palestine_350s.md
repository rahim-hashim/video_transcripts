# Kayleigh McEnany: This is a spiritual and moral catastrophe that must be addressed
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00)
*  The argument could be made Kaylee that not only is it educated people but most apropos of Steve's point this administration [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=0.0s)]
*  Yes, Barry Weiss. I encourage everyone to watch that speech. It's 38 to 8 minutes long. I watched the first half this morning [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=6.9s)]
*  She positioned what is happening in our society more broadly in a way. I haven't heard the case made [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=13.88s)]
*  She said on October 7th. There was a terrorist attack. We know babies were burned alive [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=20.06s)]
*  We know and she described in detail [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=24.84s)]
*  They are still trying to locate bodies that were burned at such a high degree [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=26.8s)]
*  That they're having to match teeth because those are the only remnants left of these people [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=30.68s)]
*  She goes through the details and she says that terrorist attack happened on 10 7 the next day on 10 8 [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=34.760000000000005s)]
*  She described a moral and spiritual catastrophe [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=41.66s)]
*  And that's what this is because what happened on October 8th in the days that followed what happened on October 8th? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=45.44s)]
*  Was people were shouting gas the Jews in the streets of Sydney, Australia [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=51.12s)]
*  there were people marching in Berlin in New York City in [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=55.32s)]
*  London on behalf of [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=59.28s)]
*  Hamas this Friday when I was sitting in for Hannity, New York City. I watched the streets [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=61.12s)]
*  We had a reporter there people going through the streets climbing up a pole removing an American flag and putting a Palestinian flag there [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=65.24s)]
*  We are seeing kids hiding in libraries Jewish kids hiding in libraries. We are seeing [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=72.67999999999999s)]
*  Pro Hamas martyr signs on the side of George Washington University [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=78.16s)]
*  This is a sport a spiritual and moral catastrophe and it must be addressed and she is right to frame this broadly [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=83.0s)]
*  And to that point Kennedy so that the moral catastrophe [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=90.11999999999999s)]
*  I think what so many find so shocking is how quick that match was lit ablaze [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=92.82s)]
*  I remember having dinner a few years ago with a prominent Jewish businessman here in New York City who said there's such a rise in [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=97.47999999999999s)]
*  Anti-Semitism on campuses and I sort of I couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe that in that day and age [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=104.18s)]
*  That's what was experiencing. He actually texted me after October 7th and said look what's happening now [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=108.98s)]
*  I mean he he was right hideously. He was right about that spread [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  Philippe Reines wrote a piece for Fox News that talked about that sort of underpinning that undercurrent that was so close to the surface [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=119.06s)]
*  So it's entitled what a Columbia University board members resignation reveals about how Jews really feel right now [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=126.02000000000001s)]
*  But he went on to say it's hard to explain how unnerved American Jews are right now [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=131.5s)]
*  Our sense of security has given way to not understanding how we didn't realize so much [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=136.22s)]
*  Anti-Semitism was right below the surface and where it was lurking our sense of security was grounded in knowing friend from foe [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=141.42000000000002s)]
*  And that has been appended. Yeah, and and that's the thing that's so shocking about it is it is so overt [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=149.18s)]
*  You know, you don't have to look for this subtext [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=156.10000000000002s)]
*  You don't have to look for these subtle clues [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=158.66s)]
*  It is right there in the open and when people are doing things like Steve alluded to like tearing down [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=160.18s)]
*  the posters of missing children missing family members [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=166.3s)]
*  These are hostages and imagine how any one of us would feel if a close family member were sitting there [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=169.86s)]
*  in the hands of murderers [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=177.34s)]
*  It's I cannot imagine the uncertainty in the war they go through every single day [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=179.34s)]
*  But what people are doing when they tear those things down? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=184.1s)]
*  They're saying that these victims were asking for it these victims caused this [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=186.64s)]
*  Their deaths their torture is justified [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=192.4s)]
*  You know based on a very complex set of policies that they obviously don't fully [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=195.4s)]
*  understand and they don't want to make the world a better place because what Hamas is offering what global jihad offers is a [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=201.28s)]
*  horrible version of life for everyone which you know is shrouded essentially in death to anyone who [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=207.88s)]
*  disagrees with them or challenges the theocracy [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=215.52s)]
*  Including ironically all of those championing Hamas's causes because they would also be among those that Hamas would love to slaughter [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, Hamas does just want a bloodbath [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=226.52s)]
*  I mean they clearly don't want to govern because they've had years of possibility and opportunity to do that in billions of dollars [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=228.70000000000002s)]
*  Flowing through that very small 25 mile [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=237.12s)]
*  15 wide 25 mile long piece of land and they have spent it on living underground like scorpions and roaches [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=240.32s)]
*  That they are because they are hostage-taking serial killers [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=248.24s)]
*  So rather than feeding their own people and building them electrical grids and giving them fresh water. They didn't want to govern [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=252.04s)]
*  Do you think they'd want to govern anywhere else? I think not. They just want the rest of us to go away [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=257.8s)]
*  I do want to talk about this march on on the mall though, because I think this is so critical [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=262.64s)]
*  You mentioned that President Biden is not there [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=267.52s)]
*  He's meeting in a very important meeting with President Xi of China [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=270.2s)]
*  We just pray and hope that it goes better than some of his other meetings have and that he doesn't do any harm to make [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=273.6s)]
*  Things worse. That's our hope today. Exactly. Kamala Harris could have skipped it [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=278.92s)]
*  She actually could have been here because I agree with Kennedy and whoever else sat on this couch [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=283.44s)]
*  What does she add to the table? I don't know [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=288.0s)]
*  Maybe she tries to catch him when he makes a mistake [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=289.96000000000004s)]
*  But I do want to talk about the voices that you will hear there the president of Israel Isaac Herzog [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=292.56s)]
*  the house speaker [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=299.24s)]
*  Mike Johnson who you sat down with he's new one month now Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries is there [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=300.88s)]
*  Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer Senator Joni Ernst so you have a bipartisan [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=307.71999999999997s)]
*  group of people who've shown up and [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=312.76s)]
*  That's important. That's really critical to show the world that some people can get it together [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=315.32s)]
*  There might be some people there that that should be surprised to find because I seriously believe with all my heart [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=320.56s)]
*  Some of these young people Emily, they don't even know what they believe [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=326.64s)]
*  They just want to show up to a crowd and I'm grateful that Hakeem Jeffries is there because remember he had no comment after [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=329.44s)]
*  Right, so everyone's presence that matters showing up matters [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=335.36s)]
*  So I bravo to everyone that has shown up will show up or expresses solidarity [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=339.12s)]
*  With that March today and for those that owned that don't that absence speaks volumes [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeBAnEBWM00&t=344.40000000000003s)]
