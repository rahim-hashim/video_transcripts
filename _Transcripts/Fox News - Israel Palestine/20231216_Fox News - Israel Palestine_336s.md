# This is the price America has to pay for being a global ‘superpower’: Expert
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk)
*  All right, let's bring in a former ambassador at large and Atlantic Council senior non-resident [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=0.0s)]
*  fellow, Nathan Sales, to talk about why the White House, I guess, is seemingly on the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=4.28s)]
*  defensive here. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=9.86s)]
*  Nathan, so the U.S. is carny, as Lucas was pointing out. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=10.86s)]
*  The Red Sea shot down about 14 drones today. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=13.92s)]
*  I think we're talking $2 million each to bring down a drone. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=17.2s)]
*  Why are we not attacking the launch sites? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=22.96s)]
*  It's a great question. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=25.44s)]
*  It seems to be open season on Americans in the region, and not just Americans, but these [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=26.9s)]
*  shipping containers on these ships as well. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=31.46s)]
*  I think the White House is afraid of its own shadow. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=34.46s)]
*  It's afraid of provoking Iran, which is the puppet master here. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=37.86s)]
*  We talk about the Houthis. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=41.6s)]
*  We talk about these militia groups in Iraq. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=42.7s)]
*  They're acting on orders from Tehran. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=45.14s)]
*  They're using weapons provided to them by Tehran. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=46.94s)]
*  They've been trained by Tehran. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=49.5s)]
*  So if you really want to stop the attacks, you've got to crush the head of the snake. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=51.36s)]
*  And the head of the snake right now is the Islamic Republic of Iran that has a long-term [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=55.22s)]
*  goal of driving the United States out of the region and destroying the state of Israel. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=59.14s)]
*  If we simply sit back as though we were a spectator, Iran is going to keep doing it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=63.879999999999995s)]
*  We've done it before. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=69.06s)]
*  I mean, under the Trump administration, we went after and took out Soleimani. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=70.06s)]
*  And there was a lot of panic that that would set off World War III. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=73.1s)]
*  Didn't happen. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=76.86s)]
*  So what's the reasoning? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=78.42s)]
*  And I know you mentioned one of our allies also does not want us to do this. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=79.42s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it's not just during the Trump administration when we took Soleimani off [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=83.69999999999999s)]
*  the battlefield. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=87.1s)]
*  And remember, this was a man who had the blood of literally hundreds of American soldiers [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=88.1s)]
*  on his hands who died in Iraq. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=91.86s)]
*  But it wasn't just then. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=93.83999999999999s)]
*  Ronald Reagan did something very similar back in the 1980s. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=95.17999999999999s)]
*  He basically sank half the Iranian Navy in one day. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=98.25999999999999s)]
*  And what happened? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=102.1s)]
*  We did not find ourselves in World War III. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=103.1s)]
*  And the reason for that, the lesson we need to draw from history, is that Iran backs down [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=104.97999999999999s)]
*  when confronted with displays of American strength. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=110.41999999999999s)]
*  It's American weakness that is provocative. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=114.14s)]
*  Now, there's also some countries in the region that are telling us, like, maybe don't take [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=115.7s)]
*  out the Houthis because that's going to disrupt this sort of very uneasy ceasefire that exists. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=120.14s)]
*  The Houthis have been waging war on Saudi Arabia, on the United Arab Emirates for a [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=126.1s)]
*  number of years. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=131.1s)]
*  And so there's some understandable concern about what it would mean for the United States [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=132.1s)]
*  to take out Houthi terrorists. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=137.2s)]
*  But that's what we have to do. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=139.62s)]
*  That's the price we have to pay for being a superpower. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=141.82s)]
*  At a minimum, we've got to be able to protect our own troops and to protect our diplomats. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=143.34s)]
*  And simply hoping for the best and hoping the Houthis cease firing is not a recipe for [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=148.62s)]
*  success. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=153.38s)]
*  And at the end of the day, this is really all about Israel, right? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=154.38s)]
*  It's about trying to blockade Israel and creating chaos in these waters. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=156.88s)]
*  But let me ask you, should we expect other European countries to get involved? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=163.82s)]
*  I know the U.K. was involved with us today. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=168.14000000000001s)]
*  But should there be some sort of coalition in these waters to protect these ships? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=171.5s)]
*  Look, I don't think that would hurt. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=175.5s)]
*  And as you said, the European countries that have robust military capabilities are taking [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=177.1s)]
*  the steps that we are to try and protect the shipping in this region. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=182.82s)]
*  The problem is, there aren't, like, once you go through the Brits and the French, we're [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=187.34s)]
*  not really talking about a long list of European military partners. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=191.5s)]
*  That's a big problem and a separate problem. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=195.14s)]
*  But the basic problem here is the United States has all the authority we need. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  We have all the tools we need to protect our people and to protect ships that are bringing [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=201.32s)]
*  goods and oil around the world. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=206.23999999999998s)]
*  I mean, if you think inflation is out of control now, wait till you see what happens when the [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=208.28s)]
*  Houthis shut down the Red Sea. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=212.95999999999998s)]
*  So we don't actually need any more partners than what we've got to prevent that from happening. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=214.95999999999998s)]
*  What we need is will. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  We need the president. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=221.38s)]
*  We need the White House to make the decision that this matters, that we're going to use [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=222.44s)]
*  the capabilities we have to protect Americans and to protect commerce. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=225.98s)]
*  Go back to that, though. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=229.54s)]
*  What happens if they shut down the Red Sea? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=231.04s)]
*  They're able to, and we don't do anything about it. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=233.16s)]
*  What happens to an average American? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=235.5s)]
*  Prices go up dramatically. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=238.35999999999999s)]
*  I mean, we already heard that 10 percent of the world's oil comes through the Red Sea. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=239.89999999999998s)]
*  So many goods and services, goods that we are purchasing for Christmas probably came [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=245.56s)]
*  through the Red Sea. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=250.42s)]
*  If you take those shipping quarters offline, and that's what the Houthis are trying to [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=251.82s)]
*  do, if you take that offline, that's going to hit Americans in the pocketbook at a time [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=255.88s)]
*  when they're going to be paying off their credit card bills for maybe a Christmas blowout. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=261.64s)]
*  So again, the White House needs to take this seriously. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=266.42s)]
*  We have all the tools we need. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=269.62s)]
*  We've got two carrier groups right now on station. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=271.2s)]
*  These aren't there for show. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=274.98s)]
*  They're there to take action. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=276.38s)]
*  Do you think we could see something over the holidays? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=277.38s)]
*  I mean, some kind of a, they're not saying anything right now, and they wouldn't. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=279.54s)]
*  It would be a surprise attack. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=283.36s)]
*  But I mean, are you confident that we could see something a little bit more aggressive [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=284.68s)]
*  from the White House? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=288.91999999999996s)]
*  I wouldn't hold my breath. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=290.32s)]
*  We've seen since October, mid-October, almost 100 attacks on American soldiers. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=292.47999999999996s)]
*  And typically what we do is sit back and wait for another half dozen. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=297.28s)]
*  I think after about 20, the ratio is about 20 to one. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=302.08s)]
*  After about 20 attacks, you'll see the American response. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=306.59999999999997s)]
*  And the responses have been, frankly, underwhelming, blowing up an empty warehouse. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=309.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, they keep doing it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=314.0s)]
*  So obviously the message isn't getting across. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=315.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=316.96000000000004s)]
*  Or the message they're getting is, again, it's open season on Americans. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=317.96000000000004s)]
*  We can attack them with impunity. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=320.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=322.52000000000004s)]
*  Nathan Sales, thanks for coming in and joining us. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZbeQ0tQAk&t=323.52000000000004s)]
