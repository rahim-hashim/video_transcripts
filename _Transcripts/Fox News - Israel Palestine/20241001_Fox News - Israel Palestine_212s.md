# Lt. Col. Sarit Zehavi: We cannot continue to tolerate missile attacks
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI)
*  Sarit Zahabi is joining us now, president and founder of the Alma Research and Education [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=0.0s)]
*  Center. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  Thank you very much for joining us. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  First your thoughts on what you and all of us have learned so far? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=8.4s)]
*  The first thing we have learned is that Iran didn't hesitate to be involved directly in [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=15.24s)]
*  this campaign against Israel. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=21.36s)]
*  It happened in April. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=22.36s)]
*  We should have learned the lesson that it will happen again. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=23.36s)]
*  And second, we learned that Iran didn't make a decision to abandon Hezbollah even though [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=26.76s)]
*  it failed and it was humiliated. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=32.800000000000004s)]
*  It made a decision to stand by Hezbollah and to escalate the current conflict. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  Hey Sarit, it's John Roberts here in Washington. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=42.160000000000004s)]
*  So the count from Israel is 181 ballistic missiles that Iran fired at Israel. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=46.160000000000004s)]
*  That would make it according to our Lucas Tomlinson, the largest ballistic missile attack [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=52.0s)]
*  anywhere in history. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=55.839999999999996s)]
*  And yet Israel managed to intercept most of the rockets. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=57.6s)]
*  Some of them fell harmlessly. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=62.98s)]
*  It would appear into the sea. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=63.98s)]
*  Others did fall into the interior of the country. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=65.24s)]
*  But according to Rear Admiral Daniel Haggai, no significant damage or casualties at this [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=68.24s)]
*  point. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=72.8s)]
*  So Israel's got to feel pretty good that Iran can throw the worst at it and Israel can fend [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=74.28s)]
*  it off. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=81.52s)]
*  So what does that say about the potential for Israel responding to Iran? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=83.12s)]
*  Knowing that the guy that you're or the person that you're about to hit really can't hit [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=89.56s)]
*  you back gives you a lot of confidence that you could really launch a punishing blow against [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=93.28s)]
*  them. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=98.4s)]
*  First, I must say that in order to decide how to respond, we need to take in consideration [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=99.4s)]
*  the active other fronts that we have, especially the northern one. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=107.12s)]
*  We just started an incursion there. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=111.32s)]
*  It is, you just reported, it seems to be evolving. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=113.72s)]
*  And we don't want to harm the chances that this incursion will achieve its, fulfill its [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=118.24s)]
*  mission, which is to clear the areas next to the border from any RADWAN capabilities. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  And many of these were found and were published this afternoon by the IDF. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=131.24s)]
*  Second, I think we shouldn't judge the missile attack only by the outcome of how many people [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=137.36s)]
*  were killed, because bear in mind that we had eight million Israelis out of nine million [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=142.72s)]
*  that ran to bomb shelters today. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=148.68s)]
*  This is a huge disturbance to the daily life. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=151.12s)]
*  We cannot continue to tolerate missiles attack, even though very few people are getting killed [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=153.84s)]
*  or injured. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=160.4s)]
*  It means that the whole country is basically paralyzed. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=161.4s)]
*  Damage to economy, damage to our mental health, damage to education. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=165.32s)]
*  I can tell you my daughter is not going to school in the past two weeks. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=170.76s)]
*  That's the situation in North to high-fives right now. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=174.88s)]
*  Hospitals are going underground. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=179.92s)]
*  We need to have more normal life and we should stop counting just how many people are getting [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=181.88s)]
*  killed. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=186.64s)]
*  We should look at that in how a state can function and including the airport, of course, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=187.64s)]
*  this was closed during the attack. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=193.24s)]
*  We thank you very much for joining us. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel, I always appreciate your time. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXByHdhuYI&t=197.4s)]
