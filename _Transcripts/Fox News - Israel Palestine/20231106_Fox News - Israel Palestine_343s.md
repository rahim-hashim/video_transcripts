# Israeli military reveals how Hamas uses hospitals, playgrounds as shields
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4)
*  Meantime, Israeli media says IDF forces will enter Gaza City today or tomorrow, where they [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=0.0s)]
*  will go street by street and into a spiderweb of tunnels looking for Hamas fighters. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=5.48s)]
*  The mission is, of course, complicated, as Israel releases this video appearing to show [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=10.1s)]
*  how Hamas is using hospitals and playgrounds as shields for their attacks. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=14.18s)]
*  Here you can see the IDF soldiers exposing a tunnel opening. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=20.78s)]
*  This is part of our operation, a ground operation that was conducted on the hospital and revealed [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=28.14s)]
*  a tunnel that was being used for terror infrastructures. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=34.1s)]
*  The terrorists also shoot at our soldiers from within the hospital. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=37.14s)]
*  Israel's former Justice Minister Eilat Shekhead joins us now. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=43.82s)]
*  Eilat, good morning to you. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=46.94s)]
*  This is all happening as the IDF has Gaza City surrounded. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=49.34s)]
*  The IDF is expected to enter the city soon, and this is where there could be significant [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=53.26s)]
*  casualties with Israeli forces. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=58.7s)]
*  So just your thoughts this morning as Israel enters this next phase of this war. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=60.82s)]
*  Yeah, it's a mandatory act because you know that our goal is to eliminate the Hamas. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=65.62s)]
*  After they slaughtered our families, they murdered small children and they kidnapped [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=75.34s)]
*  children, babies, women, and we don't have any other choice. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=82.46000000000001s)]
*  And as you show, they are using hospitals, kindergartens as a component for terror. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=87.02s)]
*  They are using like they shoot missiles out of there and rockets out of there, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=97.42s)]
*  and we need to clean the area. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=103.58s)]
*  So, you know, they have two options, either to die or to surrender. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=105.58s)]
*  You said you need to clear the area. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=112.06s)]
*  How do you do that tactically? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=113.5s)]
*  Fight an enemy that does this, hides behind hospitals, hides behind nurseries, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=115.18s)]
*  while limiting civilian casualties in those hospitals, in those child care centers. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=119.18s)]
*  So we are fighting according to the international law. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=125.58s)]
*  And also, according to the international law, if they are using hospitals as a terror center [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=129.98000000000002s)]
*  and as a place in which there are terrorists either inside the hospital or in the underground, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=138.94s)]
*  it's a target. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=145.66000000000003s)]
*  So, you know, we are trying to pursue the population there to live, but some of them [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=147.42000000000002s)]
*  stay because the Hamas using them as a human shield. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=153.82000000000002s)]
*  I don't know if you show in Fox News horrible videos in which the Hamas shoot its own people, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=157.34s)]
*  the people that are trying to move to the south. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=165.58s)]
*  They just kill them. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=168.46s)]
*  So the Hamas slaughtered our families and they killed their own people as well, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=170.78s)]
*  and they try to push them not to move to the south because in the south they will be safe [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=176.22000000000003s)]
*  and they want to use them as a human shield. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=182.06s)]
*  But, you know, we are doing all the effort that we can in order to push them to evacuate the area. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=184.46s)]
*  But if they choose not to do that, so they are supporting Hamas, they will have to fight. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=192.7s)]
*  Yeah. Israel has dropped flyers. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=199.01999999999998s)]
*  They've sent millions of text messages telling people to get out of the region, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=201.5s)]
*  and if they don't, their own lives are going to be in their hands. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=205.17999999999998s)]
*  I also want to ask you about Secretary of State Antony Blinken. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=208.38s)]
*  He's in the region right now meeting with Turkish leaders, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=210.94s)]
*  and he's pushing for a humanitarian pause. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=213.82s)]
*  The Biden administration's thinking is that if there's a pause in fighting, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=215.89999999999998s)]
*  it will be easier to negotiate hostage releases. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=219.42s)]
*  How do you feel about that? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=222.06s)]
*  It's a big no-no for us, you know. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=224.94s)]
*  Humanitarian pause or ceasefire is just the same. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=228.46s)]
*  It will help the Hamas. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=233.18s)]
*  It's like giving weapon to the Hamas. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=234.54s)]
*  We are not going to let it happen unless they will release some of our hostages, you know. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=237.5s)]
*  Maybe the children, the babies, the women, and we will not give them ceasefire, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=244.7s)]
*  which is a big, big, you know, it's like to give weapon to the Hamas. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=250.62s)]
*  It's a huge help for them. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=256.22s)]
*  They are our enemies. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=258.06s)]
*  They are our enemy. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=259.42s)]
*  Our goal is to eliminate them, and we will not agree to have a ceasefire [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=260.78000000000003s)]
*  only if they release our kidnapped children. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=266.78000000000003s)]
*  I want to ask you one more question about Antony Blinken. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=270.22s)]
*  He met with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas yesterday, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=272.38s)]
*  and during the meeting he stressed, this is a quote, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=276.54s)]
*  he stressed the U.S. commitment to pressuring Israel to protect civilians in Gaza, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=278.86s)]
*  increase humanitarian aid, and rein in and punish extremist Jewish settler violence [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=283.74s)]
*  against Palestinians in the West Bank. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=289.66s)]
*  How do you feel about that messaging and that characterization of things? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=292.22s)]
*  We are giving humanitarian aid. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=298.46000000000004s)]
*  We are letting the international community, you know, to bring everything they need, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=301.5s)]

*  This is fine by us if they want to help the population that is there. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=310.14s)]
*  Regarding what's going on in Judea and Samaria, well, we have police forces, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=316.21999999999997s)]
*  we have military, and the Israeli citizens should act according to the law. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=322.62s)]
*  And if you don't, you get punished, punishment. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=329.02s)]
*  You know, in Israel, we are a state of law, and we are taking care of extremists. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=332.46s)]
*  Eilat Shakat, Israel's former Justice Minister. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc7Rn-QQMO4&t=338.46s)]
