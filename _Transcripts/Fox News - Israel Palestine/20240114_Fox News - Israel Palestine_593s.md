# Nikki Haley slams Trump on important voter issue: ‘He’s not telling the truth’
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [January 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM)
*  Thank you so much. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=0.0s)]
*  We'll see you later in the show. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=1.0s)]
*  Joining us now, Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=2.9s)]
*  Good to see you again, Governor. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=6.08s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=7.08s)]
*  Ambassador, whichever title you choose. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=8.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=9.08s)]
*  Welcome to Iowa. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=10.08s)]
*  You're looking for president. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=11.08s)]
*  I know. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=12.08s)]
*  So let's talk about the new poll before we get to policy. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=13.08s)]
*  It's got you in second place. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=14.08s)]
*  That matches the Suffolk poll that came out just a couple of days ago. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  You guys have very carefully managed expectations here. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=18.5s)]
*  Do you feel like this second place strong poll showing now puts a target on your back? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  Does it give you higher expectations that if you don't hit second place, it's going to [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=27.48s)]
*  be seen as a loss leaving here? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=30.2s)]
*  Well, I think we've always had a target on our back because we've been the one moving [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=31.44s)]
*  up. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=34.52s)]
*  Everybody else is going down and that's a great thing. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=35.52s)]
*  But the real poll, you know, is on caucus day. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=37.4s)]
*  And what we've said is we just want to come out of Iowa looking strong. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=40.46s)]
*  We want to come out of New Hampshire strong. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=43.36s)]
*  We want to come out of South Carolina strong. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=44.92s)]
*  This is, you know, continuing state by state and trying to get every single vote that we [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=46.620000000000005s)]
*  can and we're not going to stop until that very last second. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=51.28s)]
*  So let's talk about inside the Des Moines poll. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=54.2s)]
*  There's some information about enthusiasm. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=56.28s)]
*  Forty nine percent of those who say they intend to support President Trump said they were [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=58.36s)]
*  extremely enthusiastic. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  When that same question was put to your supporters, nine percent said they were extremely enthusiastic. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=63.96s)]
*  When we pulled about, are you definitely going to show up? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=68.36s)]
*  You fall behind both DeSantis and Trump. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=70.88s)]
*  Given the weather situation here and these issues about enthusiasm, do you worry it could [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=73.68s)]
*  impact how you finish? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=78.16s)]
*  I'm not worried. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=79.92s)]
*  Look, I'm not a political pollster. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=80.92s)]
*  I'm not going to worry about the numbers. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=82.08s)]
*  What I am going to say is the momentum and the energy on the ground is strong. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=84.54s)]
*  We feel it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=88.02000000000001s)]
*  We know that this is moving in the right direction. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=89.02000000000001s)]
*  And to me, the only numbers that matter are the ones that we're going up and everybody [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=91.38000000000001s)]
*  else went down. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=94.58000000000001s)]
*  That shows that we're doing the right thing. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=95.9s)]
*  I think Iowans will decide intensity tomorrow. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=97.7s)]
*  We're just excited that tomorrow is the day. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=100.74000000000001s)]
*  It's go time and we're going to keep crisscrossing the state. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=102.62s)]
*  We've done that for days now. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=105.5s)]
*  We're going to keep doing it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=106.94000000000001s)]
*  And I think the intensity will show tomorrow. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=107.94000000000001s)]
*  OK, so let's talk about some of the issues you'd have to confront right away if you were [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=109.66000000000001s)]
*  to become president. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=113.02s)]
*  Taiwan had elections this weekend and they chose the person that seemed the most US friendly, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=114.46s)]
*  the one that China did not want. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=119.61999999999999s)]
*  Axios puts it this way, the Chinese government is likely to ratchet up its pressure campaign [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=121.46s)]
*  against Taiwan. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=125.74s)]
*  In response to the election of a politician, Beijing has called a separatist through and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=127.06s)]
*  through. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=130.98s)]
*  President Biden was asked about the election yesterday. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=131.98s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=134.54s)]
*  Hard to hear him, but you can see there he said we do not support independence. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=143.02s)]
*  So first of all, do you think that this election is going to increase tensions with China and [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=149.54000000000002s)]
*  how would you deal with the time Taiwan issue as president? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=153.9s)]
*  Well, I think first of all, big blow to China without question. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=156.38s)]
*  They had been intimidating with drones. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=159.68s)]
*  They had been intimidating with all types of election misinformation, trying to change [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=161.38s)]
*  the results and democracy won, freedom won. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=166.74s)]
*  And the people of Taiwan showed that they want to continue living the way they're living. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=170.26s)]
*  And so that's the key is America should always support democracy and freedom. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=173.94s)]
*  And I think that's why we'll continue to support Taiwan. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=177.85999999999999s)]
*  Well, we have a backlog of orders. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=180.14s)]
*  We talk about this a lot on the show about weaponry, munitions, all kinds of things. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=182.26s)]
*  I mean, billions of dollars in back orders to Taiwan. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=185.54s)]
*  What would you do as president to signal we see you, we know the threat you're facing, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=188.62s)]
*  we're going to make sure you get what you've ordered from us? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=193.1s)]
*  Well, first of all, look at the system. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=195.26s)]
*  I mean, the problem that is happening is Department of Defense plays too many favorites with [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=196.82s)]
*  defense contractors. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=202.98s)]
*  We need to go and clean it up. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=204.16s)]
*  Even in our Department of Defense, they've got too many programs they don't need to have. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=206.1s)]
*  They're not mission focused. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=209.85999999999999s)]
*  We need to look at modernizing. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=211.06s)]
*  First take care of us, modernize, make sure that we're focused not on the old wars like [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=213.1s)]
*  the generals are now land, air and sea, but about artificial intelligence, cyber, space, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=217.74s)]
*  hypersonic missiles, submarines. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=222.45999999999998s)]
*  Those are the things we need to focus on going forward. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=224.26s)]
*  Once we take care of us, our goal is to make sure that they get what they need, not just [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=226.78s)]
*  from us, but from the alliance in making sure all of our partners that love democracy and [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=230.94s)]
*  freedom that they're all pulling their weight. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=235.38s)]
*  This doesn't have to be US only. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=237.78s)]
*  This has to be a team effort. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=239.46s)]
*  And there are a lot of democracies that want to see Taiwan continue to be free. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=241.06s)]
*  So let's turn to Israel. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=245.02s)]
*  Governor DeSantis said this week that while you were at the UN as our ambassador that [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=246.58s)]
*  you backed a two state solution. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=250.02s)]
*  Here's what Politico said at that time in 2017. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=251.66s)]
*  It said US Ambassador Nikki Haley says the United States absolutely supports a two state [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=254.34s)]
*  solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and anyone who thinks it doesn't is in error. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=258.7s)]
*  That was the Trump administration's position. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=265.18s)]
*  What would a Haley administration's position be given the events of October 7th and beyond? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=267.74s)]
*  I mean, you have to look at October 7th and to see those people beheaded and those babies [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=272.34000000000003s)]
*  burned alive and those girls raped and their naked bodies dragged through the streets of [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=277.46s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=282.5s)]
*  What did they say? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=283.41999999999996s)]
*  Death to Israel, death to America. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=284.58s)]
*  What we need to know is Israel is a bright spot in a tough neighborhood. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=286.41999999999996s)]
*  We need to make sure they have whatever they need whenever they need it. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=290.53999999999996s)]
*  We need to make sure we eliminate Hamas and we need to do whatever it takes to bring the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=293.85999999999996s)]
*  hostages home. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=297.34s)]
*  In order to do that, we need to let Israel do what they need to do to be safe. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=298.74s)]
*  This is a problem I have with Biden. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=303.0s)]
*  He goes and says he supports something, but then he wants to control it. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=305.08s)]
*  That's not what you do. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=308.41999999999996s)]
*  You have to be a friend and that means allow them to make the decisions they want to make. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=309.78s)]
*  What Israel needs to know is they're not going to have terrorists on their border. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=313.74s)]
*  What Israel needs to know is there will no longer be a threat coming out of Gaza. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=316.82s)]
*  That's what they're trying to do. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=320.9s)]
*  We need to support, not control what's happening in Israel. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=321.94s)]
*  But a two-state solution, is there any scenario in which that works? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=324.4s)]
*  What I saw at the United Nations was it's not that Israel didn't want a two-state solution, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=327.02s)]
*  the Palestinians didn't want a two-state solution. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=331.98s)]
*  Every agreement that was put on the table, the Palestinians rejected right off the bat. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=334.56s)]
*  The Palestinian Authority is not serious about a two-state solution. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=339.3s)]
*  They want a one-state solution. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_VsuzvGKM&t=342.58s)]
