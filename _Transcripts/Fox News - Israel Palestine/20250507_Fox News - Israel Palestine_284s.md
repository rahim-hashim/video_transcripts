# 'DISINFORMATION FIGHT': What could be next for India-Pakistan conflict
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ)
*  President Trump announcing a surprising ceasefire with Houthi rebels a week before his Middle [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=0.0s)]
*  East trip. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=4.66s)]
*  The U.S. has been carrying out extensive airstrikes against the Iran-backed terrorists since mid-March [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=5.66s)]
*  now. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=11.16s)]
*  Let's bring in Florida Congressman Brian Mast, House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=12.16s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=15.5s)]
*  Very busy afternoon. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=16.5s)]
*  Please do give us your take on the president's actions here and where you see this conflict [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=17.5s)]
*  going next. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=22.84s)]
*  The president's been very clear. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  There needs to be an end to attacks on United States interests, our vessels, and Israel [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=26.8s)]
*  is one of our interests as well. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  We see that as our largest vessel in the region, no doubt. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=32.96s)]
*  And so with the president engaging in this conversation, you have a situation where our [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=36.04s)]
*  vessels are infinitely safer, Israel is infinitely safer. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=40.94s)]
*  And I would say the Houthis are in infinite more danger because if the president has to, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=43.96s)]
*  we have no doubt that he will unleash the full suite of violence that the American military [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  is capable of. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=51.96s)]
*  This was Tammy Bruce, the State Department spokesperson under the Trump administration [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=53.12s)]
*  on Fox earlier today on the Houthis and President Trump's actions. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=57.4s)]
*  Listen here. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=61.44s)]
*  President Trump's approach, of course, has worked again in that nobody in the world seems [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  to be used to a forceful American response with a leader who will not back down. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=68.42s)]
*  Now they have one, they know his history, and part of this success is not just our military [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=73.12s)]
*  action. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=78.6s)]
*  There's the fact that Trump is the president and they know that he gets done what he says [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=80.24s)]
*  he wants done and they're complying. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=83.83999999999999s)]
*  To her point, it does not look like the president is backing down whatsoever here. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=85.91999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think again to her point, to your point, he has a bat and he knows how to swing [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=89.96s)]
*  it and he's not afraid to swing it and he's not afraid to swing it as hard as he can because [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  when you do that, that's where you create the scenario for every other foreign intelligence [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=98.44s)]
*  agency that's looking on, every other terrorist group that's looking on, hey, that's the way [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=102.69999999999999s)]
*  that the United States of America and their president reacts, so let's back off a little [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=107.6s)]
*  bit because we don't want that suite of violence unleashed upon us. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=111.25999999999999s)]
*  All right, I want to ask you about these strikes in Pakistan, India striking Pakistan, said [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=113.89999999999999s)]
*  to have lost aircraft in all of this. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=120.3s)]
*  What do we know about this and what can you report to our viewers? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=122.61999999999999s)]
*  What do we need to know right now? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=126.89999999999999s)]
*  I think, you know, I can tell you, number one, I'm going to be speaking to both sides. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=128.42s)]
*  I can't tell you, I'm not going to tell you the order in which I'm doing that because [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=131.5s)]
*  one of the things that you have at play here is not just a kinetic fight that's going on, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=134.98s)]
*  but there's a huge disinformation fight going on on both sides of it, so that's factual [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=139.5s)]
*  for both sides of it, both trying to posture in different ways to say this is what's taking [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=144.62s)]
*  place. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=149.62s)]
*  Of course, we know we're dealing with two nuclear powers that are acutely aware of the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=150.62s)]
*  fact that they are both nuclear powers and so I think in that you do see a really an [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=154.42000000000002s)]
*  approach to this that they are making purposeful and calculated actions, not simply knee-jerk [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=161.02s)]
*  reactions to the moments of what maybe a population might want and so I think that's to the credit [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=166.78s)]
*  of both sides. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=171.54000000000002s)]
*  All levels of the U.S. government are speaking to both sides on this to make sure that, you [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=172.78s)]
*  know, we can do everything to tamp this down and bring this to a de-escalation as quickly [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=177.14000000000001s)]
*  as possible. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=181.82000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, as we know, Pakistan is slamming these strikes, calling them an act of war. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=182.82000000000002s)]
*  Here's more from Tammy Bruce, the State Department spokesperson for the Trump administration [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=186.94s)]
*  on this. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=191.22s)]
*  Listen. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=192.22s)]
*  They want these generational wars and problems to end and the way, clearly, the status quo [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=193.22s)]
*  has not worked and the way to do it is, in fact, through the vision and the handling [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=199.82s)]
*  and the inside of Donald Trump and the people that surround him. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=204.46s)]
*  So it is good that, you know, we're involved in the sense of assisting a kind of a communication [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=208.02s)]
*  as occurred last night and to touch base with both of those parties and, of course, they [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=214.14s)]
*  know we want no escalation. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=218.94s)]
*  They know we want no escalation, but will there be, Congressman? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=220.94s)]
*  I don't think you can say that there won't continue to be skirmishes that exist there. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=225.7s)]
*  There have been skirmishes that have existed year after year after year in this Kashmir [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=229.7s)]
*  area that's controlled by both India and Pakistan by a de facto agreement that exists there. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=234.06s)]
*  But the big difference that we face in this moment is that for the very first time, you [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=240.34s)]
*  had this one of these terrorist groups targeting a specific civilian area, specific tourist [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=244.70000000000002s)]
*  area, very specifically targeting non-militant personnel, and that's really the game changer [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=251.02s)]
*  that you have going on here. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=256.22s)]
*  But again, still both sides very cognizant of the tools that they could both bring to [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=257.34000000000003s)]
*  bear in this fight and I think working to make sure that this conflict does not come [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=262.3s)]
*  to that point. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=266.54s)]
*  Congressman Brian Mast of Florida, I appreciate your time, sir. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=267.54s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=269.70000000000005s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=270.70000000000005s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDYeDacengQ&t=271.70000000000005s)]
