# Mayor Adams, NYPD blame 'outside agitators' for pro-Hamas protests
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4)
*  The protests are also creating a major safety and security situation for law enforcement and mayor Eric Adams says the protesters flooding New York City [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=0.0s)]
*  campuses aren't just students [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=7.74s)]
*  People who peacefully protest for an issue. They're not throwing bottles in chairs. And so we know [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=10.9s)]
*  That we have acknowledged and saw across the country. There are people who come [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=18.900000000000002s)]
*  Have nothing to do with the issue and they want to [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=24.82s)]
*  Aggravate we can't have outside agitators come in and be destructive to that city [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=28.72s)]
*  Sergeant John paratree 17 years in law enforcement is the founder of blue labs matter NYC and he joins me now [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=35.46s)]
*  Sergeant good morning to you, you know outside agitators or not. These people are in New York City and when you see [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  Gosh this level of anger and hate towards Jewish people [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=48.36s)]
*  The United States Western society as a whole you wonder how did we get here? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=52.94s)]
*  And also are we barreling towards something really bad happening in New York City again? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=57.26s)]
*  Well, what's wrong is wrong at the end of the day whether they're not from here or they're here and I do agree with him [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=62.14s)]
*  100% they do come here. They're coordinated. They're orchestrated [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=66.14s)]
*  You know kids nowadays don't even know how to change a lightbulb to think overnight with these cadences and things like that [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=69.34s)]
*  It is outside agitators and they do try to get the misinformed kids to step up there and do dumb things like [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=74.25999999999999s)]
*  Getting the cops face and throw bottles and be destructive. We can't have it and to be quite honest [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=79.48s)]
*  He said it back in the day. I did march I did protest but you don't do it this way [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=84.56s)]
*  Right. What has the police experience been like with these protesters? It's always disgusting cops go out there every single day [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=88.72s)]
*  It's very easy to get hurt [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=94.48s)]
*  You're getting people that try to push you and shove you and cross the line so you do something wrong. There's cameras everywhere [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=95.64s)]
*  It's not easy for them, but they have shown the utmost respect and restraint and they're gonna continue to do it [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  You mentioned the organization of this all and the NYPD is apparently investigating [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=107.33999999999999s)]
*  Who is funding these protests people have mentioned that all the tents look the same things like that [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=112.66s)]
*  How difficult how hard is it to get to the bottom of something like that? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=118.69999999999999s)]
*  It's not an easy process. We've put two and two together and why not ten months ago? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=122.58s)]
*  Why not a year ago is this going on? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=126.25999999999999s)]
*  It just so happens that we're coming up to an election and all hell's breaking loose and it's not just happening here. It's orchestrated [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=127.89999999999999s)]
*  It's happening in other states and we're seeing them stop airports stop traffic [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=134.20000000000002s)]
*  You don't do this unless you're on some kind of system to be able to coordinate with one another [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=138.44s)]
*  Yeah [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=142.20000000000002s)]
*  And then I wonder what would happen after the NYPD does discover if there is a group outside of a student organization [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=142.32s)]
*  That's funding something like this. Could they get in trouble? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=148.8s)]
*  Listen, you can't just stop somebody just because you think something they have to do something criminal in order for police officer [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=152.28s)]
*  Go up to them, right? So you kind of have to wait and watch unfortunately in these situations. Yeah [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=157.46s)]
*  All right. Well, there's also this that we have to talk to you about so president Biden he's going to Syracuse [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=161.74s)]
*  Tomorrow for a campaign stop but his trip is gonna come a week after two police officers [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=167.38s)]
*  We're killed in the line of duty in Syracuse [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=173.82s)]
*  So listen to what's going on behind the scenes with the planning of this trip in the words of Jeff Moran [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=176.06s)]
*  He's the president of the Syracuse police been left benevolent Association [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=181.06s)]
*  He says the department expressed their concern to the Biden administration [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=185.66s)]
*  Regarding his trip and the quick turnaround of a Syracuse police officer being buried and an on dog a County Sheriff's Deputy being buried [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=188.92000000000002s)]
*  And then the manpower that it would take and everything that our members have been through in the past week those concerns [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=196.8s)]
*  Were expressed to the Biden administration and the Biden administration elected to move forward with this visit [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=204.32000000000002s)]
*  What do you think about this? We had Diller killed. We had the two Syracuse cops killed [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=210.8s)]
*  We had the Chicago police officer just killed. I don't understand when this administration and his president [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=214.9s)]
*  He's gonna put politics aside and say I have to be there for the families [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=219.18s)]
*  I need to be there for law enforcement and for this country [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=222.42s)]
*  What he should have done is put it to the side shown up there and in my personal opinion after you pay your respects [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=225.04s)]
*  After you show you care then move forward, you know, I'm sick and tired of this [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=230.1s)]
*  You know, you would think this president would come out and say enough is enough [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=234.46s)]
*  We have two options either, you know, you're going to jail for life for killing a police officer with no chance of parole [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=236.57999999999998s)]
*  Or we're gonna have the death sentence, but he's not gonna say that [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=240.82s)]
*  Yeah, well, I remember when the president said that he wouldn't go to East Palestine [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=243.68s)]
*  He didn't want to do that because he didn't he didn't want to disrupt a community that was still in pieces [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=246.44s)]
*  and now you have the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=252.12s)]
*  Police department in Syracuse saying we can't handle this right now [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz9gEaTycT4&t=253.16s)]
