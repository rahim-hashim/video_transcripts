# Israel ‘foiled’ Hezbollah’s recent attack on civilians, expert reveals
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [August 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes)
*  For more on this, let's bring in Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danin. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=0.0s)]
*  Danny, welcome. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=4.4s)]
*  Thank you for having me, Mike. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=6.0s)]
*  So why did Israel feel a need to strike Hezbollah at this time? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=7.68s)]
*  Well, let's make clear about it. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=12.92s)]
*  You know, we foiled, successfully we foiled a planned attack of Hezbollah. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=15.0s)]
*  We gathered the intelligence early morning that they are planning to attack Israel. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=19.84s)]
*  And I'm talking not only about northern Israel, but also the center of Israel. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=24.44s)]
*  And we decided to take preemptive action. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=28.18s)]
*  And we were very successful. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=30.46s)]
*  You know, we targeted the sites of the launchers and we destroyed thousands of rockets and [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=32.5s)]
*  we intercepted the rest that they sent into Israel. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=39.0s)]
*  And I think we sent a very strong message to Hezbollah. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=42.22s)]
*  We don't want to escalate the situation, but we are ready for all scenarios. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=45.34s)]
*  We are ready to defend our people, but also to attack targets deep in Lebanon. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=49.620000000000005s)]
*  In the last few minutes, we learned one Israeli sailor was killed, two Israeli soldiers were [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=55.18s)]
*  wounded. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=60.82s)]
*  Is that your understanding of the casualties on your side? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=61.82s)]
*  Well, yes, unfortunately, you know, the one sailor died because the Iron Dome interceptor [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=64.78s)]
*  targeted by accident the boat. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=73.02s)]
*  He was sailing. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=75.86s)]
*  And we're now looking at the situation. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=76.86s)]
*  We're learning what happened there. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=78.98s)]
*  But overall, I think we were successful. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=80.84s)]
*  You know, Hezbollah had plans to target civilians in Israel to kill innocent civilians and we [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=83.58000000000001s)]
*  pushed them back. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=90.06s)]
*  But I think we have to look at what will happen next. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=91.54s)]
*  We will not allow Hezbollah to stay on the fence. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=94.02000000000001s)]
*  We have 100,000 refugees who left their communities and they have to go back one day to their [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=97.22s)]
*  communities, to their homes. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=102.5s)]
*  So it's only a matter of time until either Hezbollah will move peacefully thanks to diplomatic [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=104.26s)]
*  efforts or we will have to use our might again to push them back. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=110.74s)]
*  Is this Iran trying to stir up trouble through Hezbollah as a way of undermining ceasefire [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=116.22s)]
*  talks? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=123.3s)]
*  Well, Iran and Hezbollah, you know, it is the same thing. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=124.3s)]
*  You know, Iran is being funded and Hezbollah, they take instructions from Iran. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=128.01999999999998s)]
*  Sometimes they play the game that, you know, they are not connected, but we don't buy it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=135.01999999999998s)]
*  And I think the Iranians, they saw our capabilities last night. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=139.1s)]
*  They understand that we have very strong air force that can get anywhere in the Middle [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=142.38s)]
*  East and I would not advise them to test us. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=147.1s)]
*  Let's show this tweet from Al Arabiya's Washington correspondent, a timeline of sorts about these [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=151.1s)]
*  talks. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=156.62s)]
*  July 10th, cautiously optimistic. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=157.62s)]
*  July 19th, talks inside 10-yard line. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=160.18s)]
*  July 24th, in closing stages per senior administration official. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=163.42s)]
*  August 7th, as close as it's ever been per John Kirby. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=168.45999999999998s)]
*  August 17th, closer than ever before per President Biden. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=172.66s)]
*  August 20th, deal on brink of collapsing per U.S. officials. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=176.77999999999997s)]
*  So where are those talks now? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=181.85999999999999s)]
*  But it's devastating. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=184.38s)]
*  You know, we know that the hostages in Gaza today are suffering. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=185.57999999999998s)]
*  Some of them are not with us because of the circumstances that they have to live in the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=190.57999999999998s)]
*  tunnels. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=196.42s)]
*  And we are doing our best to bring them back home. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=197.57999999999998s)]
*  But you know, we are not dealing with rational players. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=200.17999999999998s)]
*  So some of our colleagues, you know, sometimes they believe that, you know, it's reasonable [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=202.45999999999998s)]
*  that they will accept the deal. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=206.29999999999998s)]
*  But for the last five rounds, Hamas said no, we don't accept the deal, even though Israel [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=207.89999999999998s)]
*  was willing to make major compromises. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=213.45999999999998s)]
*  So we are not dealing with logical players. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=216.64s)]
*  I think we will have to continue with the military pressure to bring them to a point [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=219.35999999999999s)]
*  that they will have no other choice. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=223.77999999999997s)]
*  Our deal is to destroy Israel. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=226.18s)]
*  They don't care about the hostages. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=227.70000000000002s)]
*  They don't care about the future of Gaza, reconstruction of Gaza. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=229.34s)]
*  They care about destruction. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=233.74s)]
*  What more can the Biden administration and U.S. policymakers do right now to help the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=236.06s)]
*  situation and to help Israel? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=241.0s)]
*  Well, first, we are grateful for the support, the very fact that the presence of U.S. power [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=242.66s)]
*  in the region, it sends a very clear message to the Iranian, stay out of it. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=250.3s)]
*  This war, I hope they will listen to those threats. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=255.62s)]
*  But we need the support. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=260.18s)]
*  You know, at the end of the day, we will fight the bad guys. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=261.18s)]
*  But those bad guys are the enemies of the United States. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=264.0s)]
*  You know, take a look at the guy we killed in Lebanon, this terrorist Shoukry. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=266.34000000000003s)]
*  He was in charge of killing more than 200 Marine soldiers in Lebanon in the 80s. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=271.46000000000004s)]
*  So we are fighting the world of the United States, but we definitely need the support [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=276.22s)]
*  and the backing of the U.S. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=280.34000000000003s)]
*  Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Dannen. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=282.7s)]
*  I know how busy of a time it is for you. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzMYynkyIes&t=285.7s)]
