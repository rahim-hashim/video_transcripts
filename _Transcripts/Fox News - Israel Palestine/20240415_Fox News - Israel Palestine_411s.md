# Biden admin: US won't participate in possible Israel counterattack
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU)
*  happening today. The house is expected to address funding and support for Israel after [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=0.0s)]
*  an unprecedented attack from Iran. 300 Joe drones and missiles fired by Tehran. The U.S. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=14.6s)]
*  helped take down nearly all of them. Meantime, President Biden will meet today with the prime [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=21.48s)]
*  ministers of Iraq and the Czech Republic after he told Israel that the U.S. would not [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=25.84s)]
*  participate in any possible counterattack against Iran. You're watching Fox and Friends [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=30.64s)]
*  First here on a Monday morning. I'm Todd Pyrone. And I'm Carly Schimkes. We have team coverage [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  this morning. Congressman Cory Mills will be joining us along with former U.S. Defense [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=40.24s)]
*  Intelligence Officer Rebecca Koffler. But we begin with Madeline Rivera live in Washington. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=44.64s)]
*  Maddie. Good morning, Carl. The president is facing two tall tasks when he needs for the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  prime ministers of Iraq and the Czech Republic today. He's working to maintain the International [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=55.72s)]
*  Coalition of Support for Ukraine. At the same time, he's trying to deescalate the situation [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=60.72s)]
*  in the Middle East after that unprecedented attack by Iran against Israel over the weekend. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  President Biden says the U.S. will step in to help Israel defend itself. What he says [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=71.8s)]
*  the U.S. won't do is participate in a counteroffensive if Israel does launch one against Iran. Louisiana [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=76.0s)]
*  Senator John Kennedy has some tough words for the president. With respect, go to Amazon [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=82.4s)]
*  and buy a spine online. Peace through weakness never works, not with these hard, hard men. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=88.92s)]
*  Israel's not at war with Hamas or Hezbollah or Yemen. Those are all surrogates for Iran. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=97.92s)]
*  is a war with Iran. Iran hates Americans. Iran hates Jews. Iran wants to kill Americans [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  and Jews. And if we turn the other cheek to them, we're going to get it in the neck. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  On Fox News Sunday, Shannon Breen pressed National Security Council spokesperson John [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  Kirby about a sanctions waiver that allows Iraq to continue buying electricity from Iran. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=126.91999999999999s)]
*  The move gives Iran access to about $10 billion, which the Biden administration says can only [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=132.6s)]
*  be used for humanitarian goods. The State Department says the waiver was initiated under [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  the Trump administration, whom the White House is accusing of emboldening Iran. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=143.16s)]
*  It's hard to take a look at what President Biden has done and say that we've somehow [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  gone soft on Iran. It was the previous administration that decided to get us out of the Iran deal, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=152.48s)]
*  and now Iran is so much dramatically closer to a potential nuclear weapon capability than [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=158.2s)]
*  they were before Mr. Trump was elected. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=163.11999999999998s)]
*  The president will also be talking about helping Iraq with the lasting defeat of ISIS during [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=167.83999999999997s)]
*  his conversation with the prime minister today. Carly Entau. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=172.2s)]
*  Alright, Madeline Rivera live for us in Washington. Maddie, thank you. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  You got it of course. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=178.32s)]
*  Let's bring in Rebecca Koffler, former U.S. Defense Intelligence Officer. Rebecca, good [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=179.32s)]
*  morning to you. You say the importance of how Israel responds cannot be understated, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=182.48s)]
*  so what are the options on the table here and ultimately what do you think they're [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=188.08s)]
*  going to do? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=191.32000000000002s)]
*  Well, first of all, Israel must respond forcefully because what Iran has done, it crossed Israel's [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=192.32000000000002s)]
*  red line by striking directly inside Iran. This has never happened before. It's a huge [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=199.32000000000002s)]
*  departure from Iran's war fighting doctrine. So what Israel must do, it must convince Iran [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=205.8s)]
*  that the benefit that they derive from that attack is completely erased by the cost that [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=214.8s)]
*  Israel will impose on them. So we are talking something along the lines of attacking Iranian [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=220.60000000000002s)]
*  nuclear program infrastructure, right? Something that is a military target supporting command [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=228.72s)]
*  and control and leadership, supporting oil infrastructure, something very significant. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  There's a concept that is called unacceptable damage in warfare. That's what they must do. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=241.48s)]
*  Biden said don't. Iran did. Coincidence that this happened, this finally crossing of the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=248.95999999999998s)]
*  red line by Iran on Joe Biden's watch. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=255.32s)]
*  It's 100% predictable, Todd. Yes, a whole roster of officials from the Biden administration [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=258.12s)]
*  went in and on the record said don't, don't, don't. And the Iranians went ahead and they [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=266.12s)]
*  did that anyway. What does it tell you? That nobody respects Biden. That has huge implications [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=272.12s)]
*  in the strategic stability of the entire world. If Iran doesn't listen, that means Russia. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=279.12s)]
*  China does not listen. Why is that? It's because everything that President Biden and his team [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=285.12s)]
*  have done so far is the opposite of what one must do to convince your adversary not to [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=290.84000000000003s)]
*  escalate, right? Biden tried to micromanage Benjamin Netanyahu and how the Israelis conduct [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=298.88s)]
*  their war fighting operations. He released $6 billion to Iran and basically enriching [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=305.44s)]
*  them. Where does that money go? Of course it goes towards their military operations. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=311.88s)]
*  Biden also did not respond in any meaningful way after the Iranian proxies attacked 170 [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=317.4s)]
*  times. The U.S. forces giving them brain damage. Okay? So no one respects him and my concern [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=325.56s)]
*  is what is coming next after the red lines are crossed? Well, that's the big question [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=331.2s)]
*  and you mentioned Israel attacking on Iranian soil, the nuclear sites. So if that does happen, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=335.84s)]
*  if they do take that option, will that be a deterrent or will that escalate things? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=342.56s)]
*  Well, they must out escalate, right? They must out escalate nor deescalate to convince [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=347.56s)]
*  Iran. Now there are various ways of striking nuclear sites, right? Nuclear program support [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=355.12s)]
*  sites. There's a non-kinetic attack. We are brilliant at that. We have a tremendous cyber [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=361.88s)]
*  capability. We've used it before during the Obama administration. So it doesn't need [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=367.08s)]
*  to necessarily go boom, right? Although that's what the viewers and the populations of those [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=372.91999999999996s)]
*  countries look for. It has to be something convincing. But the only entity that you need [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=379.24s)]
*  to convince is the Iranian leadership. And if those nuclear centrifuges stop, that is [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=385.56s)]
*  going to send a very, very strong signal. Yeah, there are a lot of options on the table [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=391.52s)]
*  and we wait to see which one Israel will choose. Rebecca, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP0gMh9lCZU&t=396.2s)]
