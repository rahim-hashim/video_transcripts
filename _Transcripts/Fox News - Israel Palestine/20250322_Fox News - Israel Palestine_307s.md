# Israel and Hamas need to come back to the table: Former defense official
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [March 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc)
*  For more, let's bring in today's foreign policy panel, former ambassador at large in Atlantic [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=0.0s)]
*  Council, senior fellow Nathan Sales and former deputy of defense, Department of Defense, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=7.88s)]
*  deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=12.72s)]
*  Welcome to both of you. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=14.52s)]
*  Thanks Mike. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=15.52s)]
*  So let's start in the Middle East. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=16.52s)]
*  We were hoping to go to phase two, right? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=18.38s)]
*  And it was difficult and now it appears to be a mess. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=21.06s)]
*  Ambassador, what is your assessment right now? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=23.92s)]
*  Well, it looks like Hamas has chosen war. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=25.52s)]
*  For the past month, after phase one of the deal expired, Hamas and Israel, with some [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=28.04s)]
*  help from the United States and other mediators, have been trying to extend the ceasefire. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=35.04s)]
*  Israel has been asking for Hamas to continue to release hostages. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=40.28s)]
*  Hamas has dug in its feet. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=43.08s)]
*  It looks like that Israel's patience has run out. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=44.36s)]
*  And so Israel has calculated that military pressure is what it's going to take to get [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=47.739999999999995s)]
*  Hamas back to the negotiating table. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=52.4s)]
*  That's the only reason Hamas was prepared to negotiate in the first place. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=55.32s)]
*  They've been using the past month to regroup in Gaza. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=59.84s)]
*  And I think Israel's thinking, all right, if it worked before, we're going to have to [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=63.04s)]
*  use the hard medicine to get them back to the table now. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=66.2s)]
*  Sabrina, up until January 20th, this was one of your headaches. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=68.72s)]
*  Your assessment of where we are in the Middle East right now. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=72.92s)]
*  Look, it took a really long time to get to phase one of this ceasefire deal. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=75.16s)]
*  I mean, it took from May 2024 to January 2025 to put the ceasefire into place. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=79.08s)]
*  And when that ceasefire was in place, we saw hostages being able to return and come home. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=83.92s)]
*  That's what we need to see again. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=88.4s)]
*  Hamas walked away from the table, and they need to come back. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=89.8s)]
*  What I'm curious to see is how this administration is going to put pressure on Hamas and also [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=93.48s)]
*  Israel to come back, because phase one was so important. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=98.4s)]
*  And we need to see an extension so we can continue to see those hostages come home. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  But while these airstrikes are going on, what's happening is that also puts at risk those [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=105.68s)]
*  hostages. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=110.4s)]
*  Put out statements that these airstrikes put their lives at risk. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=111.88000000000001s)]
*  And of course, it puts innocent Palestinian lives at risk. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=115.36s)]
*  So we need both sides to come back to the table. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=118.56s)]
*  Ultimately, phase two, as we were talking, that's going to be the hardest part to execute [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=120.44000000000001s)]
*  on. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=124.68s)]
*  So let's get this extension back in place. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=125.68s)]
*  To Ukraine, where there may be some hopeful signs, there's at least conversations going [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  on about potentially a deal there. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=131.76s)]
*  Your assessment of that, Mr. Ambassador. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=134.0s)]
*  Well, Mike, I think we have seen over the past week that Vladimir Putin is the obstacle [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=136.35999999999999s)]
*  to peace. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=141.6s)]
*  You know, I think there was some real concern in the White House over the past month as [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=142.6s)]
*  to whether or not Ukraine was prepared to make some tough choices in order to get peace [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=146.16s)]
*  realized. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=151.96s)]
*  Ukraine said yes. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=154.48s)]
*  And when Vladimir Putin was given the option, the opportunity to agree to a partial ceasefire, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=155.68s)]
*  his response was to escalate his attacks on Ukrainian civilians, including energy infrastructure. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=161.60000000000002s)]
*  So I think it's clear now that we need to judge Putin not based on what he says. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=166.32000000000002s)]
*  He's a trained spy. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=171.16s)]
*  This is a man who lied for a living and he didn't give that up when he became president [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=172.96s)]
*  of Russia. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=176.36s)]
*  Don't judge him based on what he says. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=177.36s)]
*  Judge him based on what he does. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=179.4s)]
*  And what he's doing is continuing to dig in for a long fight against not just Ukraine, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=180.84s)]
*  but against the West generally. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=186.36s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=187.36s)]
*  I want to play for you what President Trump's saying about the situation. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=188.36s)]
*  I'll get you to react to it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=191.36s)]
*  We have immense technical expertise in the United States to run those plants. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=194.36s)]
*  I don't think that requires boots on the ground. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=198.12s)]
*  But I'll leave the foreign policy to President Trump and Secretary Rubio. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=200.32000000000002s)]
*  I know they are working tirelessly. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=204.0s)]
*  How do we bring peace to Ukraine? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=206.16000000000003s)]
*  How do we get this fighting to stop, which takes both sides to lay down their arms? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=208.0s)]
*  But if it was helpful to achieve that end, have the U.S. run nuclear power plants in [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=212.68s)]
*  Ukraine? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=216.92000000000002s)]
*  No problem. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  We can do that. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=218.92000000000002s)]
*  I've dealt very well with both, gentlemen, and we have, I think we have the confines [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=220.04s)]
*  of a deal. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=225.95999999999998s)]
*  I hope we have the confines of a deal. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=226.95999999999998s)]
*  I believe we're going to pretty soon have a full ceasefire, and then we're going to [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=227.95999999999998s)]
*  have a contract. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=231.6s)]
*  And the contract's being negotiated, the contract in terms of dividing up the lands, et cetera, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=232.6s)]
*  et cetera. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=237.44s)]
*  It's being negotiated as we speak. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=238.44s)]
*  Sabrina, how do you assess Russia-Ukraine at this stage? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=240.76s)]
*  Look, this is the same president that said on day one he was going to have peace and, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  you know, there was going to be peace in the Middle East, peace in Ukraine. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=248.04s)]
*  And I think what he's finding is that is a lot harder said than done. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=250.12s)]
*  You know, when it comes to Russia and Ukraine, the same unconditional ceasefire was put in [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=254.68s)]
*  front of both parties. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=259.48s)]
*  And Ukraine agreed to what, you know, the ambassador was saying, and Russia did not. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=260.64s)]
*  And they've escalated their attacks on, you know, around Zaporizhzhia. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=264.56s)]
*  There's a critical power plant. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=267.36s)]
*  We're seeing those attacks continue every single day. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=268.56s)]
*  So it's very clear that Putin is not serious about peace. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=271.12s)]
*  And I think this administration just needs to be able to come to terms with that. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=274.92s)]
*  What we need to do is strengthen our alliances within NATO. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=278.48s)]
*  We need to continue to send military support and equipment to Ukraine so they can continue [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=281.52s)]
*  this fight in taking back their sovereign territory. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=287.04s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=289.4s)]
*  Sabrina Singh, Ambassador Nathan Sayles, thanks very much. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=290.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=293.28s)]
*  Thanks, Mike. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=294.28s)]
*  Stay tuned to the podcast for full episodes right now. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1cxaMwwwlc&t=304.88s)]
