# Yingst: Israel has received the list of hostages to be released Saturday
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE)
*  We begin first with foreign correspondent Trey Yankst. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=0.0s)]
*  He's live on the ground in southern Israel. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=2.56s)]
*  Hi, Trey. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=5.16s)]
*  Yeah, hey, Jillian, good afternoon. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=8.0s)]
*  Here at the Hatzarim Air Base, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=9.32s)]
*  some of those released hostages [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  are receiving the first medical treatment in Israel [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=13.24s)]
*  before they are taken to other regional hospitals. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=16.32s)]
*  This has been a day of anticipation. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=19.38s)]
*  So many across this country waiting [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=21.56s)]
*  to see if their loved ones would get to safety [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=24.04s)]
*  and if the ceasefire would hold. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=26.68s)]
*  This all started this morning at 7 a.m. local time. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=28.6s)]
*  The ceasefire went into place. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=31.44s)]
*  It was violated just one time, but it did hold. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=33.08s)]
*  Ultimately, those 13 Israelis were released [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=36.2s)]
*  into the hands of the Red Cross. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=38.72s)]
*  They went into Egypt and then made their way into Israel. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=40.5s)]
*  Additionally, there were a group of 11 foreign nationals [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=43.84s)]
*  that were released from Hamas custody [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=48.24s)]
*  as part of a separate deal today, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=50.84s)]
*  also returning to Israel, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=52.72s)]
*  where they were met by embassy staff, mainly from Thailand. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=54.08s)]
*  As this is taking place, there are questions [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=57.52s)]
*  about if this process will play out tomorrow. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=59.52s)]
*  We're getting the names and the faces [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=62.52s)]
*  of these individuals that got out today. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=64.08s)]
*  You mentioned nine-year-old Ohad, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=66.44s)]
*  who marked his birthday while he was inside Gaza. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=68.04s)]
*  He was released along with his mother and his grandmother, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=71.44s)]
*  so many families, mostly from the small community [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=74.32000000000001s)]
*  known as the Kibbutz of Neroz [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=77.54s)]
*  that sits just over the border from Gaza. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=79.12s)]
*  We were there, dozens of people taken hostage, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=82.14s)]
*  but again, 13 released, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  and it appears 11 of them are from that community of Neroz. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=87.2s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=90.74s)]
*  says he's hopeful today [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=92.88s)]
*  that more hostages will get released tomorrow [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=94.08s)]
*  and had this to say about the situation. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=96.36s)]
*  I emphasize to you, the families, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=99.32s)]
*  and to you, the citizens of Israel, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=101.56s)]
*  we are committed to the return of all our abductees. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=103.96s)]
*  This is one of the goals of the war, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=107.44s)]
*  and we are committed to achieving all the goals of the war. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=109.52s)]
*  The reality on the ground is that it will be a difficult battle ahead [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=112.92s)]
*  because this is a temporary pause in the fighting, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=117.0s)]
*  a ceasefire for just four days as part of a larger deal [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=119.6s)]
*  that was negotiated by the Qataris. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=122.72s)]
*  When that is done, not only Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=124.72s)]
*  also the country's defense minister, Yoav Gallant, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=127.96000000000001s)]
*  have made very clear they will resume their campaign [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=130.2s)]
*  against Hamas inside Gaza. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=134.08s)]
*  Jillian. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=136.24s)]
*  Trey, a short while ago, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=137.84s)]
*  President Biden was asked by a reporter [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=139.44s)]
*  he said he doesn't have any information [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=141.48s)]
*  about the condition of the remaining American hostages. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=143.48s)]
*  I'm just curious whether you have heard anything [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=145.48s)]
*  on the Israeli side from your sources there [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=147.48s)]
*  about the condition of the Americans [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=149.48s)]
*  or, frankly, any of the hostages that remain in Hamas' captivity. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=151.48s)]
*  So the short answer is no. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=157.48s)]
*  The Israelis didn't even have information [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=159.48s)]
*  on the condition of these 13 hostages [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=161.48s)]
*  that were released today [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=163.48s)]
*  until they made it into the hands of the Red Cross. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=165.48s)]
*  And that's been part of the challenge here [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=167.48s)]
*  Initially, in these negotiations, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  it appeared that Israel would push [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  to ensure the Red Cross had access to the other hostages [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=173.51999999999998s)]
*  including the American citizens inside Gaza. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  That did not happen. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  And then as a result, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  there was new pressure on the negotiations. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  They were very fragile and about to fall apart. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  But then they went forward [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  and these 13 were released today. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=187.51999999999998s)]
*  And my producer is just handing me this right now. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=189.51999999999998s)]
*  And it appears at this moment [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=191.51999999999998s)]
*  and this is an update we're getting in just now [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=193.51999999999998s)]
*  that the Red Cross has been able to make [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=195.51999999999998s)]
*  the Israelis have received the list [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=197.56s)]
*  of the hostages that will be released tomorrow. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=199.56s)]
*  This is a piece of good news [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=201.56s)]
*  because the list was due earlier this evening. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=203.56s)]
*  It was not delivered by Hamas. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=205.56s)]
*  But again, we can confirm at this hour [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=207.56s)]
*  Israel has received the names of the hostages [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=209.56s)]
*  that will be released tomorrow. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=211.56s)]
*  And if all goes as planned, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=213.56s)]
*  we can expect to see a dozen or more released [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=215.56s)]
*  back into Israel as part of this larger ceasefire deal. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=217.56s)]
*  Jillian? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=219.56s)]
*  All right, thank you. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=221.56s)]
*  I'm going to go back to the question [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=223.56s)]
*  Jillian? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=225.6s)]
*  All right, thank you. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=227.6s)]
*  Important news there, development in the story tray. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=229.6s)]
*  We appreciate it. Thank you. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAPce0xbWE&t=231.6s)]
