# Biden condemns attack on Israel
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4)
*  Well, some breaking news from the White House. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=0.0s)]
*  White House correspondent Jackie Heinrich is there. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=2.92s)]
*  We're trying to find out what happened. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=5.0s)]
*  I know, Jackie, we had this meeting at what, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=6.16s)]
*  8 o'clock Eastern time? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=8.44s)]
*  Waiting on the readout. What could you tell us? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=10.0s)]
*  Well, Brian, I'll read it to you for the very first time [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=13.16s)]
*  together because we're obviously watching to see [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=15.8s)]
*  if there's any information about how the U.S. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=17.64s)]
*  counseled Israel on what would be an appropriate response. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=20.64s)]
*  This statement reads, and we're reading it [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  for the first time together, from the president, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=25.88s)]
*  Earlier today, Iran and its proxies operating out of Yemen, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=27.8s)]
*  Syria and Iraq launched an unprecedented air attack [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=31.32s)]
*  against military facilities in Israel. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=35.04s)]
*  I condemn these attacks in the strongest possible terms. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=37.44s)]
*  At my direction to support the defense of Israel, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=40.88s)]
*  the U.S. military moved aircraft [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=43.2s)]
*  and ballistic missile defense destroyers to the region [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=44.96s)]
*  over the course of the past week. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=47.68s)]
*  Thanks to these developments [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=50.0s)]
*  and the extraordinary skill of our service members, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=51.16s)]
*  we helped Israel take down nearly all of the incoming drones [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=53.6s)]
*  and missiles. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=57.4s)]
*  I've just spoken with Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=58.4s)]
*  to reaffirm America's ironclad commitment [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=60.6s)]
*  to the security of Israel. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=63.0s)]
*  I told him that Israel demonstrated a remarkable capacity [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=64.64s)]
*  to defend and defeat even unprecedented attacks, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=68.32s)]
*  sending a clear message to its foes [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=73.0s)]
*  that they cannot effectively threaten the security of Israel. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=74.92s)]
*  Tomorrow, I will convene my fellow G7 leaders [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=78.68s)]
*  to coordinate a united diplomatic response [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=81.16s)]
*  to Iran's brazen attack. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=85.36s)]
*  My team will engage with their counterparts across the region [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=87.0s)]
*  and we will stay in close touch with Israel's leaders. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=89.96s)]
*  And while we have not seen attacks on our forces [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=92.28s)]
*  or facilities today, we will remain vigilant [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=94.8s)]
*  as to all the threats and will not hesitate [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=97.8s)]
*  to take all necessary action to protect our people. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=100.12s)]
*  So a couple of significant pieces of that. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  This statement for the first time, I believe, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=107.52s)]
*  is confirmation from the U.S. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=110.52s)]
*  that these strikes heading toward Israel [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=112.16s)]
*  were not just coming out of Iran, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=114.64s)]
*  but they were also coming out of Yemen, Syria, and Iraq, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=116.92s)]
*  and that also nearly all of them were taken down [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=121.48s)]
*  before reaching Israel. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=125.72s)]
*  We did hear that from the Israelis before. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=128.2s)]
*  But the line here that I'm paying attention to [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=130.92000000000002s)]
*  is that I've spoken with Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=133.48s)]
*  to reaffirm the ironclad commitment, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=135.36s)]
*  because we've seen this NBC report [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=137.96s)]
*  saying that apparently there's concern within the White House [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=140.24s)]
*  that Israel might take an action [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=143.28s)]
*  that could drag the U.S. further into a regional conflict. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=145.76s)]
*  So we are waiting more detail on that, Brian. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=149.32s)]
*  Yeah, a lot in there. Jackie, thanks so much. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=151.52s)]
*  Got to take a hard break here. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=154.36s)]
*  That was the breaking news. We all read it together. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA20MWEeMN4&t=156.0s)]
