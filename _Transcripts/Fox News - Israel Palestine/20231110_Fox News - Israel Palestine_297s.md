# Biden has 'no plan, no strategy' to hold US adversaries accountable: Rep. Cory Mills
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk)
*  Four U.S. bases in the Middle East were attacked by Iranian-backed fighters since Wednesday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=0.0s)]
*  These attacks all coming after the U.S. carried out an airstrike on a weapon storage facility [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  in Syria, and President Biden is defending his decision. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=10.32s)]
*  Are the retaliatory strikes working? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=15.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  I mean, they're working in the sense that we're hitting the target for people. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  Our troops in Iraq and Syria have come under fire 46 times since October 17th. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=25.599999999999998s)]
*  Florida Congressman and Iraq War veteran Corey Mills joins me now. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=30.08s)]
*  Congressman, good morning to you. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  So it seems like Iran said we see your airstrike on our weapons depot in Syria, and we're [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=36.8s)]
*  going to raise you four strikes on U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria over a 24-hour period. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=41.4s)]
*  Clearly what we're doing right now isn't working. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  So what could the Pentagon be doing to prevent these strikes from taking place? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=49.52s)]
*  Well, look, the bottom line is that all of our enemies seek weakness, and they see weakness [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=54.720000000000006s)]
*  within Joe Biden and his administration. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=61.24s)]
*  You know, you didn't see these types of attacks during the last administration under [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=62.88s)]
*  President Trump. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  But in fact, whenever President Trump carried out a military operation, it was actually [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  our adversaries who would call and reach out to him to say that they have to show face, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  so that they will not actually impact any of our soldiers. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=76.8s)]
*  We see where Iran has become emboldened. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  We see where China continues to utilize them as their proxy militia. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=82.12s)]
*  And now you've got them going off and making over 40-plus attacks just in the couple last [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=86.08s)]
*  months or so on U.S. bases across Iraq. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=90.16s)]
*  This is as a result of his inability, and I back it all the way up to 2021 during the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=93.96s)]
*  Afghan botch withdrawal, whenever Biden and his administration have showed no plan, no [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  willingness to actually hold our adversaries accountable. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=104.48s)]
*  And so what you're going to continue to see, whether it's in Ukraine, whether it's the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=107.76s)]
*  threats that are going on in the Taiwan Strait, whether it's what we're seeing in Israel by [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=112.60000000000001s)]
*  Hamas or whether it's in Iraq, the China, Russia, Iran, North Korea geopolitical alignment, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  they feel very emboldened and they are willing to carry out these attacks. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=122.68s)]
*  They don't think there's going to be any type of retaliation that's actually meriting what [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=126.04s)]
*  they actually have given to us. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=130.12s)]
*  Well, emboldened is a good word to use. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=132.0s)]
*  And 56 service members have been hurt so far, 25 with traumatic brain injuries. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=133.95999999999998s)]
*  And the Pentagon recently said that these attacks by Iranian proxies, they're not meant [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=138.92s)]
*  to warn or scare. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=142.95999999999998s)]
*  They are meant to kill. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  So what if that does happen? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=145.72s)]
*  What if a service member does die? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=147.14s)]
*  Where does that leave us? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, I can tell you right now, the first thing that we need to be looking at is going [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=150.35999999999999s)]
*  with our international partners and looking to go ahead and say, if these are Iranian [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=155.72s)]
*  proxy targets, whether it is Hashd al-Shabi, whether it's Sabi al-Binhak, whether it's [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=159.72s)]
*  anyone Qatayib Hezbollah, all of the ones who are Iranian back malicious in Iraq, we [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=164.24s)]
*  need to be going after their headquarters. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=168.64s)]
*  We need to be utilizing the Iraq and national intelligence. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=170.24s)]
*  And we need to be explaining to our allies that if we are here in your nation trying [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=173.28s)]
*  to help support you in your efforts for training or equipping or trying to fight things like [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=177.24s)]
*  ISIS, that you need to be stepping up to these Iranian proxy militias as opposed to trying [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=181.36s)]
*  and allowing them to continue their attacks against America. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=187.24s)]
*  Iran said recently that the U.S., if the U.S. doesn't broker a ceasefire, we will be hit [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=189.68s)]
*  hard here at home. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  Should we take that warning seriously? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=196.88s)]
*  We should take every one of these warnings seriously. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=199.78s)]
*  Look, we know for a fact that October 7th in Israel is the equivalent of our 9-11 here [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=201.52s)]
*  at home. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  They're intelligence failures. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=207.48000000000002s)]
*  The problem is that every American knows it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=208.54000000000002s)]
*  Every Republican in the House of Representatives has been fighting it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=211.26000000000002s)]
*  We know our border is the number one issue. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=215.48s)]
*  We must secure our border. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=217.2s)]
*  We know we have hundreds every single month that are coming across that are on terrorist [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=218.73999999999998s)]
*  watch lists. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=223.0s)]
*  We know we've got millions sitting here in our country who are not actually following [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=224.04s)]
*  or being preceded by my eyes because they're being prevented. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=229.01999999999998s)]
*  And so we really need to take these types of threats seriously. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=233.07999999999998s)]
*  We're going to have our own 9-11 again. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=235.51999999999998s)]
*  And I think that that's very, very possible. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=237.92s)]
*  And this isn't a fear monger, Carly. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  This is just the realities of what we're allowing across our borders when you're talking [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=241.46s)]
*  about thousands of Afghans, people from Yemen, people from Iran, people from Russia, people [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=244.62s)]
*  from mainland China. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=249.94s)]
*  We've got gangs like MS-13 coming across. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=251.54000000000002s)]
*  This is all in an effort to go ahead and try and utilize or carry out some type of an incident [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=254.48000000000002s)]
*  here at home. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=258.26s)]
*  And we need to ensure that we're prepared and ready and take it very seriously. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=259.38s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=262.5s)]
*  And if we don't know who is in our country, how can you possibly feel safe, especially [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=263.5s)]
*  during a heightened terror alert? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=266.54s)]
*  Congressman Cory Mills, thank you so much. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gn8ovNQHsk&t=268.38s)]
