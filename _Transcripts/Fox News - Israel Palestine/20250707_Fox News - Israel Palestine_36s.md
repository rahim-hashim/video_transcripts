**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [July 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-TjqMcw5Q0)
*  As far as what is about to happen, I think that the big question is what happens during [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-TjqMcw5Q0&t=0.0s)]
*  the 60-day interim. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-TjqMcw5Q0&t=4.2s)]
*  Everybody is sort of focused on the beginning and at the end. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-TjqMcw5Q0&t=5.2s)]
*  The 60-day interim is where all the details live. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-TjqMcw5Q0&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  If Prime Minister Netanyahu can get 10 hostages out, which is what they're talking about, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-TjqMcw5Q0&t=10.92s)]
*  10 live hostages out at the beginning, that may be the extent of the hostages that actually [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-TjqMcw5Q0&t=14.88s)]
*  come out, depending on Hamas's intransigence. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-TjqMcw5Q0&t=19.16s)]
*  Everyone in a lot of these negotiations tends to focus on the United States and Israel or [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-TjqMcw5Q0&t=21.28s)]
*  the United States and Ukraine. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-TjqMcw5Q0&t=25.6s)]
*  There is another side to this negotiation, and Hamas has refused at vastly to give up [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-TjqMcw5Q0&t=27.3s)]
*  all the hostages and also to leave power. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-TjqMcw5Q0&t=31.060000000000002s)]
