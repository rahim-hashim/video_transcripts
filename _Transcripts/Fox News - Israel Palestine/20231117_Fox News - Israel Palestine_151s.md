# IDF releases alleged evidence of Hamas tunnels under Gaza hospital
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI)
*  The IDF releasing the first evidence of Hamas tunnels running under Al-Shifa Hospital, forcing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=0.0s)]
*  forces also seizing Hamas weapons found on that complex. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=6.88s)]
*  Trey Yengst has been covering this for us out of southern Israel. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=11.0s)]
*  Trey, we've seen the pictures. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=14.84s)]
*  What more are we learning? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=16.6s)]
*  Yeah, hey, good morning. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=18.6s)]
*  We continue to get more information as the Israelis operate in the Al-Shifa hospital and [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  the surrounding area. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=26.52s)]
*  They released this video overnight saying this is a tunnel underneath the complex that [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=28.0s)]
*  sits in the heart of Gaza City. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=32.72s)]
*  The Israelis say this is just the tip of the iceberg and they are still doubling down on [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=34.88s)]
*  what they say is a Hamas command center underneath the hospital. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=39.44s)]
*  Now we've not yet seen any evidence to support those claims, but again the Israelis say that [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=43.160000000000004s)]
*  more will come as they have more time to excavate and dig through this area. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=47.44s)]
*  It comes as they found more weapons at the Al-Shifa Medical Center. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=51.64s)]
*  We did speak with Hamas and you can hear behind me there quite a bit of activity along the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=55.24s)]
*  northern part of the Gaza Strip as the Israelis continue their airstrikes there. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=59.96s)]
*  But we spoke with a Hamas official last night who denied that Al-Shifa was being used to [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=64.16s)]
*  store weapons and ammunition, though the Israelis have released more images to support what [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=68.36s)]
*  they say are basically supplies for Hamas fighters to use the hospital as a base. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=73.14s)]
*  Now it comes as Israel uncovered two bodies of hostages that were being held by Hamas [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=78.48s)]
*  near to the hospital. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=83.98s)]
*  We are talking about Yehudah Tvice, a 65-year-old woman from the small community of Bari. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=85.3s)]
*  She's a mother of five. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=90.5s)]
*  Her husband was murdered on October 7th and she was taken into Gaza City. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=92.26s)]
*  There was hope that she was still alive, but yet another tragic development for the Israeli [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=96.84s)]
*  people. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=100.78s)]
*  Also, they recovered the body of a 19-year-old Israeli soldier who Hamas says was killed [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=101.78s)]
*  in an airstrike. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=106.12s)]
*  This soldier appeared in a hostage video and then Hamas released a photo of her body indicating [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=107.12s)]
*  she was killed by the Israelis. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=112.24s)]
*  This comes as Israeli forces do push deeper into Gaza City. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=114.16s)]
*  They destroyed what they say is an Islamic Jihad command center and training facility. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=116.96s)]
*  They released images of rockets. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=121.69999999999999s)]
*  We are not sure if these rockets were in use at the time or simply props for the organization [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=123.11999999999999s)]
*  to parade through Gaza as a propaganda tool. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=127.24s)]
*  But all of this comes as the chief of staff in Israel says Israeli forces are preparing [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=130.12s)]
*  to enter the southern part of the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=134.22s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=137.04s)]
*  Trey Yankston, Southern Israel for us. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=138.04s)]
*  Trey, thank you. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu33M8UY7gI&t=139.92s)]
