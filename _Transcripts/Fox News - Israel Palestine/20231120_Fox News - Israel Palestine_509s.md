# 'MASSIVE': Israeli PM Netanyahu reveals three goals for Israel-Hamas war
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go)
*  Welcome back, America. We're here with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Two [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=0.0s)]
*  kind of related questions, Mr. Prime Minister. Number one, the cultural [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=3.92s)]
*  rot in the West didn't start today, particularly when it comes to evil [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=9.88s)]
*  versus good. And furthermore, I'd be curious about your thoughts about what [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  has been taking place at this main hospital where Hamas is really dug in [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=21.68s)]
*  and your folks are really trying to do the right thing. Can you answer those [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=26.52s)]
*  questions? Yeah, in 1933, shortly after Hitler came to power, the Oxford Student [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=29.84s)]
*  Union in Britain had a debate and two to one they had a resolution that they will [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=35.84s)]
*  not under any circumstances fight for king and country. And you know, you know [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=42.92s)]
*  what that did. They had to change their way because they understood they [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=49.96s)]
*  wouldn't have a king and they wouldn't have a country and they wouldn't have an [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=53.92s)]
*  Oxford if they didn't fight. So they ended up fighting in the battlefields [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=56.18s)]
*  and fighting well until Nazism was destroyed. It's the same thing here. I [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=60.18s)]
*  mean, this is a moral indictment of higher education in the West that you [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=65.1s)]
*  have colleges and campuses that are aligning with the new Nazis and not with [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=69.46000000000001s)]
*  those who are fighting them. The second thing on the hospitals, this is not the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=74.86s)]
*  hospital you know. It's not what you see in your neighborhood. It's [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=78.34s)]
*  hospitals that have been commandeered by Hamas, use as command and control [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=81.78s)]
*  centers. We found weapons, we found ammunition and there were plenty of [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=85.3s)]
*  terrorist chieftains there and their terrorist subordinates and they fled [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=89.7s)]
*  when we entered. So these are not hospitals. We were able to clear them [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=95.7s)]
*  out without happily without combat, without a firefight. But we have to we [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=99.06s)]
*  cannot allow them to have these safe havens in hospitals. We give we give [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=105.02s)]
*  civilians in Gaza humanitarian safe zones. Hamas gives its fighters, its [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=111.1s)]
*  terrorists safe zones in hospitals. That's absurd. The last thing I want to [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=116.66s)]
*  say is this. Look, I have three goals. One goal is to defeat Hamas, utterly [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=120.41999999999999s)]
*  defeat and destroy Hamas. The second is to bring back our hostages. And the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=125.89999999999999s)]
*  third is to ensure that we don't have a similar threat in the future from Gaza [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=130.7s)]
*  and that what happens is Gaza is good for Israel, good for Palestinians, good [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=135.22s)]
*  for the Middle East. And to do that, we need to demilitarize Gaza and [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=139.5s)]
*  de-radicalize Gaza. We cannot have it mean for the foreseeable future Israeli [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=144.74s)]
*  overriding military responsibility. So we root out the terrorists and a [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=150.82s)]
*  civilian regime administration that cooperates with demilitarization and [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=155.22s)]
*  de-radicalization. And that can't be a Palestinian government that doesn't [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=160.02s)]
*  fight terrorism, but funds terrorism that teaches its children to hate Israel, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=167.78s)]
*  to work for Israel's annihilation. We need something else. We need a massive [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=172.9s)]
*  reform here. The kind that you had in Germany, the kind you had in Japan, the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=177.62s)]
*  kind you're having in certain parts of the Arab world. That's what will ensure a [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=180.98s)]
*  bright future for the people of Gaza, for the people of Israel, for everyone. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=185.38s)]
*  Are you concerned, Mr. Prime Minister, and you read it mostly through leaks, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=189.22s)]
*  but more and more public statements by various governments, our government, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=192.82s)]
*  governments in Europe, that they're already trying to decide for you and the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=197.38s)]
*  people in the area what is needed, how they're going to do it. I mean, you just [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=202.57999999999998s)]
*  pointed out that Gaza was basically the two-state solution. The Palestinians [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=207.54s)]
*  were given Gaza and it was turned into a terrorist military operation. And I'm [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=213.06s)]
*  sitting here thinking, well, what would they do with an entirely new country? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=218.1s)]
*  Would they have an air force? Could they have missiles? Can they build chemical [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=221.62s)]
*  weapons? Who's going to make sure they don't? Who's going to oversee that? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=225.86s)]
*  So what you're saying is what we did in World War II, we had a Marshall Plan, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=229.06s)]
*  but first we denazified Germany. We had to destroy the religious views of the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=232.58s)]
*  empire there. In other words, there are cultural things that have to be done [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=238.5s)]
*  before you're busy setting up something else, correct? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=241.94s)]
*  Yes, because otherwise what you're going to get is the same thing. And Hamas [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=244.34s)]
*  already says they'll stay there and they'll do it again and again and again. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=250.42s)]
*  Well, you have to defeat Hamas, but you can't get a new Hamas to emerge there. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=253.7s)]
*  And who's going to do that? Who's going to prevent the terrorists from coming in? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=259.14s)]
*  Those who refuse to fight terrorists? No, Israel. And who's going to make sure that [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=262.9s)]
*  we de-radicalize, to denazify, in your words? Well, we have to have a force that [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=266.9s)]
*  is committed to a different future for the Palestinians. I mean, they're stuck [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=272.65999999999997s)]
*  in this rabbit hole, in this never-ending loop of seeking to destroy the Jewish [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=277.53999999999996s)]
*  state. That's what's keeping this conflict alive for the last century. It's not the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=282.34s)]
*  absence of a Palestinian state. It's the presence of a Jewish state. They could [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=286.26s)]
*  have had a state. They were offered that, and the UN resolution of 1949 refused. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=290.65999999999997s)]
*  They established the PLO in 1964, three years before we had Judea Samaria, the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=296.17999999999995s)]
*  West Bank and Gaza. It was in Arab hands. The organization, the PLO, the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=301.85999999999996s)]
*  Palestine Liberation Organization was set to liberate Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Haifa, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=306.74s)]
*  Israel. The persistent refusal of the two wings of the Palestinian society, the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=312.74s)]
*  PLO and the Hamas, to accept a Jewish state in any boundary, that's what keeps [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=319.94s)]
*  this conflict going. And unless you treat that, all you're doing is you'll destroy [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=326.42s)]
*  this terrorist state that was built in Gaza, and it'll emerge again because you [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=331.22s)]
*  haven't done anything to change the ideology. You haven't done anything to [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=335.38s)]
*  these people who you want to put in their people who pay for slay. They pay [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=339.46s)]
*  the terrorists and their families. The more number of Jews they murder, the more [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=344.9s)]
*  they pay them. They teach their children that you have to liquidate Israel. Their [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=348.42s)]
*  leaders now applaud every week, every week what Hamas did. I'm talking about the [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=354.58s)]
*  moderate branch, so-called moderate branch, and their leader to date, almost 40 [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=359.86s)]
*  days after the conflict began, refuses to condemn the savagery that was [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=364.98s)]
*  perpetrated. These are the people, these are the people you want to entrust this. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=370.42s)]
*  No, we need a different future. The Palestinians deserve a different future. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=373.94s)]
*  Peace requires a different future. It requires for a foreseeable future, Israeli [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=378.42s)]
*  overriding military control, a de-radicalized and de-militarized Gaza. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=383.06s)]
*  It's possible to do it. I know that there are Arab states who can contribute to [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=388.82s)]
*  this. I know that there are others who can contribute to it, but we have to be [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=392.02s)]
*  clear about what we need. We need demilitarization and de-radicalization. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=395.06s)]
*  Nothing else will suffice, but if we do it, there'll be a better future for all. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=400.82s)]
*  And I'll say this for me, and what you don't need is an American [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=405.46s)]
*  administration that keeps pumping billions and billions of dollars into [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=409.54s)]
*  the umbrella operation, and that is Iran. Until Iran's addressed, I don't see a [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=413.46s)]
*  great deal of peace breaking out in the Middle East. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=418.5s)]
*  I think, by and large, I think that President Biden and the administration [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=420.9s)]
*  have done great things for Israel. I have to say this, because he came here, he [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=425.78s)]
*  stood with us. They were supporting us with arms. They were supporting us in [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=429.78s)]
*  many other forms. I appreciate that. We can have our differences here and there, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=435.53999999999996s)]
*  but I think we're agreed that we have to defeat Hamas. We agreed that there [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=439.53999999999996s)]
*  shouldn't be, except a temporary ceasefire for the return of hostages, there [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=444.58s)]
*  shouldn't be a ceasefire with Hamas. We have to have that victory. And I also [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=448.18s)]
*  see the support of the broad swathes of the American people on both sides of the [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=452.1s)]
*  aisle. Senators, congressional representatives, and ordinary citizens, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=456.58s)]
*  pastors, community leaders, I'm highly appreciative of that. In the end, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=463.54s)]
*  you know what the terrorists say in Iran and in Gaza? They say there's no [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=469.22s)]
*  difference between Israel and America. America is the great Satan. Israel is a [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=473.46000000000004s)]
*  small Satan. You know, in one way they're right. They say we are you and [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=477.78s)]
*  you're us. In the deep cultural sense, they're right. So let's stand together. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=482.5s)]
*  All right, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you. God bless you and our best of all of [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=489.38s)]
*  our Israeli brothers and sisters over there. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjmOSiB6Go&t=494.82s)]
