# Israeli soldier freed from Hamas captivity in Gaza
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w)
*  It's really hard. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=0.0s)]
*  It's like the 7th of October. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=18.04s)]
*  It's still going on for us. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=19.52s)]
*  It's been 24 days, but it's one long day for us all. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=22.8s)]
*  Breaking moments ago, as Harris just mentioned, an Israeli soldier has now been released from [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=28.08s)]
*  Hamas captivity after she was kidnapped in the initial raid of October the 7th. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=32.16s)]
*  According to the IDF, she was released during a ground operation and appears to be in good [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=37.2s)]
*  condition. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  Israeli media is saying this photo was taken with her family after her joyous release. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  A big development. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=48.2s)]
*  Meanwhile, we are awaiting a pair of briefings here at home and overseas. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=49.2s)]
*  The State Department expected to provide an update any moment now. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=52.8s)]
*  And in Tel Aviv, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will update reporters as Israel [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=55.92s)]
*  forces move deeper into Gaza at this hour. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=60.08s)]
*  It's all developing. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=64.22s)]
*  Welcome and hello, everybody. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=65.22s)]
*  I'm Sandra Smith. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=66.22s)]
*  And I'm John Roberts in Washington. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=67.22s)]
*  Sandra, it is good to be with you. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=69.44s)]
*  This is America Reports. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=71.1s)]
*  Pentagon officials telling Fox that U.S. forces in Syria and Iraq have been attacked 23 times [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=72.8s)]
*  since just 13 days through a mix of attack drones and rockets. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  And they say the strikes have Iran's fingerprints on them. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=82.96s)]
*  And now Iran is responding. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=86.24s)]
*  According to the Times of Israel, Iran says the strikes against U.S. forces are due to [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  America's support for Israel, contradicting what President Biden said last week. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=93.36s)]
*  And Iran is urging Washington to change its, quote, wrong policies. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=99.32s)]
*  So how should the U.S. respond? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=103.39999999999999s)]
*  We'll ask Wisconsin Republican Congressman Mike Gallagher, who sits on the House Armed [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=104.88s)]
*  Services Committee. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=109.39999999999999s)]
*  Plus Fox team coverage from around the globe over the next two hours on the breaking news [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=110.64s)]
*  from the war in the Middle East. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=114.2s)]
*  We are going to start with Trey Yankstey, who is live in southern Israel. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=115.96000000000001s)]
*  What more can you tell us, Trey, about the release of this Israeli soldier that happened [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=119.0s)]
*  in just the last couple of hours? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=123.32000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, John, good afternoon. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=125.48s)]
*  The soldier's name is Private Ori Magadish, and she was originally taken on October 7th. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=129.56s)]
*  During the massacre, she was at the Nahalo's base, a base that sits just along the Gaza [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=135.64000000000001s)]
*  border when she was kidnapped and was held hostage for the past three weeks inside the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=140.08s)]
*  Gaza Strip. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  In the distance there, you can hear some of that outgoing artillery. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  As we speak, Israeli forces are operating inside Gaza. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=149.08s)]
*  Magadish was rescued last night, according to the Israeli military, during their ground [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  operation. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=157.44s)]
*  The IDF says the soldier was medically examined and is in good condition. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=158.44s)]
*  You saw that photo there with her family, a joyous moment for them. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=162.60000000000002s)]
*  They have their daughter back home. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=165.60000000000002s)]
*  I do want to show you what it's like inside Gaza as our cameras were rolling Israeli tanks [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=167.36s)]
*  moving throughout the Strip. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=172.12s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=173.44s)]
*  You can see here the Israelis marking targets on the northeastern side of the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=175.0s)]
*  In the distance, you can hear the thud of artillery. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=182.04s)]
*  This is a very active front, and as the Israelis push deeper into Gaza, they anticipate there [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  will be more resistance, and it's part of the reason they continue strikes against different [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=191.20000000000002s)]
*  positions. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=195.92s)]
*  Right now, the Israelis are operating on the western and eastern side of Gaza. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=198.92s)]
*  The Israeli military says they are pushing deeper into the Strip, trying to put new pressure [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=203.24s)]
*  on Hamas, not only to destroy the organization, but also to look for those hostages that are [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=207.44s)]
*  still inside, still 238 people. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=212.4s)]
*  After the one piece of good news tonight, Daniel Hagari, a spokesman for the Israeli [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=215.72s)]
*  military, talking earlier today about that situation inside. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=220.12s)]
*  Over the past day, we have expanded ground activities with additional forces entering [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=224.72s)]
*  the Gaza Strip, including infantry, armored corps, combat engineering and artillery corps. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=230.56s)]
*  Through integrated strikes of the ground forces and the IAF, dozens of terrorists were eliminated [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=235.72s)]
*  last night who had barricaded themselves in buildings and attempted to attack the forces [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=240.0s)]
*  that were moving in their direction. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=244.4s)]
*  I want to explain and provide an example. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=246.04000000000002s)]
*  We are conducting expanded ground operations in the Gaza Strip. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=248.12s)]
*  There is significant damage to civilian areas inside Gaza. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=254.28s)]
*  People are still digging through the rubble following expanded Israeli strikes, hundreds [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=258.72s)]
*  of them over the past 24 hours. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=262.88s)]
*  Palestinians desperate for aid over the weekend storming a UN food warehouse in Gaza and taking [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=265.32s)]
*  everything that was inside. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=271.44s)]
*  Right now, you'll see we're in a very dark position. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=273.42s)]
*  We are waiting with the Israeli military near the Gaza border. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=275.76s)]
*  We understand we're going to get some access to these artillery units that you heard there [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6ehz5B66w&t=279.0s)]
