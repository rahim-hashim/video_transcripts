# Hostage release met with ‘mixed feelings’
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g)
*  I just want to take a quick chance to touch base, Arthel, with Trey Yankst. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=0.0s)]
*  He's back in southern Israel. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=5.84s)]
*  Trey, with some interesting words from the president earlier. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=7.04s)]
*  We heard him here on Fox News. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=10.92s)]
*  Trey, what do you have? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=12.44s)]
*  Yeah, hey, Kevin. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=14.44s)]
*  Good afternoon. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=16.92s)]
*  We understand that momentarily some of the people who were released into Israeli custody [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=17.92s)]
*  today, those 13, some of them will be flown from the Hatzarim Air Base here in southern [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=23.44s)]
*  Israel to hospitals in central Israel. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  This is the next step in the process. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=32.28s)]
*  It is what we expected would happen. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=34.12s)]
*  Two of the hostages that were released have already been taken to medical facilities, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=36.48s)]
*  likely two of the elderly women that were released who are in need of more immediate [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=40.6s)]
*  medical attention. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=44.6s)]
*  Overall, though, Israeli officials say they are happy with the condition of the hostages [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  that were released today by Hamas. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=51.28s)]
*  They were really just, I think, thrilled to see that they were not being returned, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=54.0s)]
*  people who were incredibly sick. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=59.76s)]
*  This has been such a difficult moment, Kevin, for Israel because people have such mixed [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=62.36s)]
*  feelings about today. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  They are so excited that the first group of hostages has been released and they hope that [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=68.48s)]
*  it is the beginning of a four-day process that will see 50 Israeli hostages coming home. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=72.68s)]
*  But they also understand the fighting will continue inside Gaza. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=79.0s)]
*  So the posture of Israeli forces remains high at this hour. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=82.84s)]
*  That ceasefire that started at 7 a.m., it has held so far. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=86.28s)]
*  But tonight, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier making comments about what [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=90.36s)]
*  the future looks like. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  And when we heard from President Biden earlier, there is certainly a disconnect in what comes [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=96.36s)]
*  next. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=101.0s)]
*  President Biden focusing on the diplomacy that has taken place to allow the release [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=102.0s)]
*  of these hostages. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=105.52s)]
*  And there is an understanding on the ground that that is what will get hostages out. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=106.84s)]
*  They are negotiating with Hamas, an organization that cannot be trusted in many of these conversations, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=110.80000000000001s)]
*  but also an organization that is willing to come to the table when the Qataris are mediating. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  When it comes to the military action, though, that is the big question, Kevin. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=122.16000000000001s)]
*  What happens next after this ceasefire is complete? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=125.52000000000001s)]
*  And the reality is Israel says they will go back to a full-scale operation against the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=128.76s)]
*  Gaza Strip. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=133.36s)]
*  Kevin? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=134.36s)]
*  And that is so important to keep that in mind because as Trey has been reporting throughout, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=135.36s)]
*  yes, this is a circumstance where there is celebration, but make no mistake about it, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=140.04s)]
*  the Prime Minister, Israeli Defense Forces, and in fact the whole of the Israeli government [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=144.88s)]
*  has made it clear the defense of their country will continue whether this four-day ceasefire [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=149.6s)]
*  holds or not. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=155.48s)]
*  Trey, thank you. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=156.48s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=157.48s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYZTg4_9N8g&t=158.48s)]
