# Democrats who oppose Israel are 'outliers': Dem Rep. Auchincloss
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls)
*  We're joining me now Massachusetts Democratic Congressman Jake Ockenclaw. Welcome back to the show, sir [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=0.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me on Shannon, okay [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  So let's start here, too [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=8.42s)]
*  You've said a ceasefire is not a good idea until Hamas is destroyed [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=9.48s)]
*  But I want to talk to you about the specific pause again that Wall Street Journal piece says this the ceasefire's terms [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=13.08s)]
*  Allow Hamas to extend this truce by releasing ten hostages a day as the possibility of a permanent truce nears [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=18.48s)]
*  And as Hamas starts to trade adult male and military hostages the group's demands will rise [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=25.16s)]
*  The US will pressure Israel to release hundreds of Palestinian terrorists [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=30.68s)]
*  Has the pause been a good or bad idea in your opinion? And what are your concerns with this conflict moving forward? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=35.32s)]
*  There's no such thing as good in this situation when there are still hostages being held in captivity [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=43.6s)]
*  But there is progress and this is progress [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  Hostages are being released [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=51.8s)]
*  Humanitarian aid is coming in for Palestinian civilians [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=53.72s)]
*  the Israeli Defense Forces are able to regroup as they prepare for operations to the south where [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=56.68s)]
*  The bolus of Hamas leadership that's still in Gaza seems to be and it's a testament to [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=63.48s)]
*  The president's strength and sagacity in ignoring calls for a ceasefire that would have denied Israel the leverage they needed to secure this deal [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=68.67999999999999s)]
*  But Israel is right that this is the middle not the end [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=76.6s)]
*  They had two objectives going into this conflict one is to rescue the hostages [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=80.2s)]
*  There are still hostages being held captive and two was to dismantle Hamas and Hamas is still coherent [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=84.56s)]
*  so they need to be prepared to turn south and to resume military operations and [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=89.84s)]
*  I think they're gonna have support from the American body politic in doing that. I represent a [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=95.2s)]
*  Ideologically diverse district. I have a county that voted Republican [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  I have some of the bluest zip codes in the country three months ago. This district was [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=104.66000000000001s)]
*  Pretty united in opposition to Prime Minister Netanyahu's actions on judicial reform and settlement expansion in the West Bank [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=110.04s)]
*  But now there is relative consensus that Israel has a right and responsibility to defend itself and to protect its civilians [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=116.84s)]
*  Even while recognizing that Netanyahu's hard-right cabinet has made things unnecessarily difficult with their actions in the West Bank [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=124.28s)]
*  So I think Israel should continue and resume these military operations at the expiration of the truth [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  Truth and I think the the broad American left it will be behind them [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=137.02s)]
*  So there's some conflicts within your party over this whole thing [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=140.6s)]
*  The New Yorker has this headline how Israel is splitting the Democrats the Democratic coalition once seemed united in its staunch [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=143.88s)]
*  Unquestioning support for the country today that consensus seems to be cracking [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=151.52s)]
*  How would you describe what's going on within the party because some of this is very happening very publicly? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=155.66s)]
*  There are outliers for sure and the president has been wise to ignore those calls for ceasefire [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=160.23999999999998s)]
*  which were reckless and misguided and [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=165.51999999999998s)]
*  Largely those outliers are speaking for their own political ends [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=169.04s)]
*  But there is broad consensus amongst Democratic policymakers that [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=171.83999999999997s)]
*  President Biden has been drawing on his 50 years of foreign policy experience to walk a narrow tightrope over a wide chasm [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=175.44s)]
*  Quite effectively now that's in sharp contrast to the Republican Party's [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=183.27999999999997s)]
*  Over Ukraine this is the party that as we heard from Senator Cotton likes to invoke Ronald Reagan the the man who helped liberate [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=187.32s)]
*  Ukraine from Russia. They're now prepared under the leadership of Donald Trump to hand Ukraine right back over to Russia [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=193.56s)]
*  They are deeply divided by the leader of their party [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=199.23999999999998s)]
*  Contrast that is most critical, but but to be fair they have voted for aid again and again in the House and the Senate Republicans [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=202.79999999999998s)]
*  There is a split of course within the party as there is within yours on the issue of Israel [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=210.28s)]
*  I mean we've got Senator Sanders out there saying that no more blank checks to Israel. He thinks that aid should be conditional [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=214.28s)]
*  I know that you have said you didn't think aid should be conditional [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=219.23999999999998s)]
*  Regardless of whether it's under a Democrat or Republican administration you talk about the president's deep foreign policy experience [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=222.35999999999999s)]
*  But it's one of the areas that our polling shows [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=228.44s)]
*  People don't trust him on and when it comes to the issue of Iran specifically and how he's dealing with them our brand new poll [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=231.48s)]
*  Shows that 70% of Americans think that he's been too accommodating [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=237.0s)]
*  Like Senator Cotton you have served in uniform you know about these attacks on our troops that last count at least 73 of them [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=240.6s)]
*  What should he be doing differently with respect to Iran? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=246.6s)]
*  So first of all this administration has been tough on Iran [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=252.35999999999999s)]
*  They have rolled out almost 50 new sets of sanctions that have helped lead to almost 50% inflation in the Iranian economy Iran is desperate right now [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=255.88s)]
*  They have also advanced the April 15th budget to the point where they're saying [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=264.36s)]
*  Is desperate right now [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=267.96s)]
*  They have also advanced the Abraham Accords and the thing that Iran fears more than military action by the United States more even than economic [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=269.15999999999997s)]
*  action from the United States is political isolation through the Abraham Accords and that was a large [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=275.71999999999997s)]
*  Near-term catalyst for Hamas's attack on October 7th [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=281.64s)]
*  So the senator simply isn't correct that the administration has not been tough on Iran, but if we were to follow the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=285.08s)]
*  Republican party's war path in the Middle East where we would end up with is yet another failed forever war in that region [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=293.64s)]
*  I served in 2012 in Afghanistan. I saw the futility the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=300.04s)]
*  Expense of wars without a political endgame [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=304.52s)]
*  The last thing America needs is to go back into that muck and blood of conflict in the Middle East [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=307.0s)]
*  The better thing to do the thing that I saw when I commanded special operations in Panama and helped train our allies there [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=312.2s)]
*  Is to work by and with fellow democracies as they fight on the front lines to support Israel [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=317.48s)]
*  As they fight against Hamas in Gaza to keep that to a one front war as opposed to opening up other fronts [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=323.16s)]
*  Against his Bala or against you. Excuse me against Iran directly to support Ukraine as they fight against Russia to support [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=329.16s)]
*  Taiwan as it prepares [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=336.12s)]
*  Uh for increased Chinese aggression the president is standing with democracy and he's working by and with allies and that is smart military strategy [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=338.28000000000003s)]
*  But there are a number of gop senators who have reached out to ask why this administration isn't using other things at its disposal [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=346.12s)]
*  Like sanctions a letter to the president back on november 16th [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=353.48s)]
*  They say the world is now seeing the direct result of allowing [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=356.76000000000005s)]
*  Iran's oil revenues to grow and unfreezing billions of dollars in extra-territorial bank accounts. We must prioritize [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=360.20000000000005s)]
*  Enforcing all economic sanctions. So raises the question. Why aren't we and why shouldn't we be? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=367.32000000000005s)]
*  We are the president has been seizing iranian oil exports they have [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=372.36s)]
*  Forced iran to be selling their oil on the black market where they're not recovering the majority of the total revenue from those sales [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=381.48s)]
*  They have expanded the number of sanctions against individuals more than 400 different entities or individuals including the iranian revolutionary guard corps [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=388.04s)]
*  For human rights violations and drone exports this administration is economically isolating iran [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=395.64s)]
*  At the same time as they are building [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=400.68s)]
*  Uh greater arab cohesion with israel through the abraham accords and again [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=403.15999999999997s)]
*  That is the thing that iran actually fears much more than a military strike from the united states is isolation [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=406.91999999999996s)]
*  From the success of the abraham accord that is why hamas launched on october 7th [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=413.0s)]
*  It's assault against israel and it's why that we we need to continue to isolate iran [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=417.24s)]
*  from the broader [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=424.03999999999996s)]
*  Middle east diplomatic you mentioned the abraham accords multiple times [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=425.96s)]
*  But let me ask you do you credit the trump administration with getting those done? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=429.24s)]
*  The trump administration obviously was in was in power when those got done and netanyahu really was the prime mover behind those [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=435.48s)]
*  but [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=441.96000000000004s)]
*  Yes, it was it was a it was a successful initiative that president biden has helped strengthen [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=442.92s)]
*  and what we have seen now is that instead of [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=447.96000000000004s)]
*  Launching military assaults against every toxic regime in the middle east which would create you know [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=452.28000000000003s)]
*  Six new wars by next weekend the president has been [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=457.0s)]
*  Transacting with countries like kutter which has funded hamas just as iran has to help rescue these hostages in the middle east [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=461.86s)]
*  You don't have good choices. You have tough policy-making [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=468.28000000000003s)]
*  criteria and what the president has done is both resist calls for a ceasefire from from the left while in resist calls for [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=472.82s)]
*  Escalating into a full-blown war from the right. He is walking a central statesman-like path [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=479.94s)]
*  Well, you are correct always in saying that there are no easy choices in the middle east congressman aukhan klaus [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=485.32s)]
*  We thank you for your time and for your time in uniform for us as well, sir. Thank you [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0-A_6V6Ls&t=490.59999999999997s)]
