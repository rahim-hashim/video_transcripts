# Hostage negotiator: Hamas has played this card 'very well'
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY)
*  Joining us now is former Navy SEAL Commander and hostage negotiator, Dan O'Shea. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=0.0s)]
*  Dan, thank you, first of all, for your service to our country. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=5.44s)]
*  How do you negotiate when one side does not seem to value life in the same way the other [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=8.6s)]
*  side does? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  Well, it is a challenge, but the problem is terrorist organizations, this is how they [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=16.04s)]
*  negotiate with the West. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=21.6s)]
*  And it's exactly the reason that Hamas grabbed over 240-odd hostages so they would have this [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=23.7s)]
*  leverage, knowing that this was going to be the only card they can play, and they played [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=29.24s)]
*  it very well. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=33.68s)]
*  This ceasefire is a victory for Hamas. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=34.68s)]
*  It allows them to retreat, rearm, refit, and reengage on the next phase of the IDF offensive. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=37.44s)]
*  And again, we're not dealing with the rational state player. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=44.839999999999996s)]
*  That's why these negotiations were not across the table between Israel and Hamas and why [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  it is such a challenging process going forward. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=52.7s)]
*  You know, my wife and I were in Israel about 18 months ago, and our tour guide told us [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=56.88s)]
*  the story of an Israeli soldier that was taken, and Israel exchanged 1,000 prisoners, some [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=61.44s)]
*  of whom had been sentenced to life for one single Israeli soldier. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=70.3s)]
*  So for those of us who will never negotiate over human life, you have, how do you know [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=75.8s)]
*  what the life of a soldier or an American four-year-old, how do you know what a life [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=81.66s)]
*  is worth when you are trading it? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=86.82s)]
*  Well that is the challenge, because that sergeant you're talking about, Gilad, he was held for [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=91.02s)]
*  five years and released for, as you said, over 1,000 prisoners, many of whom were convicted [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=96.5s)]
*  of capital crimes and the rest. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=101.66s)]
*  But it shows the level of how important every life is in Israel. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=104.1s)]
*  Every citizen of Israel, for 1,000 reasons, we know what they've gone through from the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=109.24s)]
*  Holocaust and the pogroms, they have been attacked and targeted throughout their existence, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=113.56s)]
*  and that's why they value life so high. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=119.83999999999999s)]
*  Yet on the flip side, Hamas doesn't value life. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=121.8s)]
*  The fact that they use their own people as human shields in this, you know, what we're [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=124.74s)]
*  dealing with right now in this latest war in Gaza, it just shows the level of difference [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=129.57999999999998s)]
*  between those in the West, those in Israel who value human life, and those like Hamas [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=134.64s)]
*  where life is a commodity to be spent at will and or executed, murdered at will, which is [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=139.6s)]
*  what they did on October 7th. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=145.04s)]
*  I cannot imagine negotiating when you cannot even agree on the currency, the value of the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  currency. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=154.48s)]
*  But before I let you go, the fighting has resumed in Gaza. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=155.48s)]
*  I'm assuming that is not a good sign for the state of negotiations about current hostages, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=159.28s)]
*  but maybe I am wrong about that. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=165.76s)]
*  Well, the challenge is if Hamas is not wiped out, what happened on October 7th will happen [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=168.92000000000002s)]
*  again. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=174.84s)]
*  Time and time again, Israel has to deal with this. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=175.84s)]
*  It happens on average every 10 years, a major conflict where they're fighting for their [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=179.76s)]
*  very existence. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=184.02s)]
*  Netanyahu needs to finish what they started, which is to wipe Hamas out. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=186.4s)]
*  But the challenge is, yes, it puts the hostages back in grave risk. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=189.88s)]
*  And the calculus of the next batch of hostages coming out will arguably be much higher because [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=194.78s)]
*  the value of these hostages have proven to be so, you know, worth so much for Hamas that [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=202.8s)]
*  the price to get the next round of hostages is probably going to come with a higher sticker [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=208.24s)]
*  price, unfortunately. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=211.64000000000001s)]
*  Dan O'Shea, thank you for your service to our country. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=214.88s)]
*  Thank you for joining us on a Sunday night. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=217.14s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3Z26x-vqY&t=220.07999999999998s)]
