# Several Hamas hostages released to Red Cross
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE)
*  Molly, let's go back to Hatsurum Air Base where Trey Yngst is outside awaiting those [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=0.0s)]
*  13 hostages after they are released at the Egypt border. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=6.08s)]
*  They will fly to you. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=9.24s)]
*  Trey, what can you tell us? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=10.24s)]
*  What's the latest? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=11.24s)]
*  Yeah, Griff, a lot of anticipation right now across Israel about these 13 hostages, women [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=12.24s)]
*  and children among the first large group that will be released by Hamas. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=20.0s)]
*  Palestinian media at this hour is reporting the hostages are on the move. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=24.36s)]
*  We've not been able to independently confirm that, but it would align with the timing in [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=28.02s)]
*  all of this. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=31.82s)]
*  They will head to Egypt's Rafah crossing in the custody of the Red Cross. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=32.82s)]
*  They'll then be transferred into Egypt where they will then cross back into Israel. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=36.78s)]
*  Now, how they will get to Hatsurum Air Base, we're not exactly sure of yet. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=41.379999999999995s)]
*  There are two major options here that have been discussed in Israeli media and by officials. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  One is by helicopter. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=49.58s)]
*  We saw images of a helicopter being prepared earlier today, and the other is by a small [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=50.58s)]
*  bus. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=55.739999999999995s)]
*  We want to make sure they can evaluate these hostages when they are safely back in Israeli [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=56.74s)]
*  hands, make sure they're giving them what they need and not put these small children [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=61.46s)]
*  in a situation where they will be scared by a helicopter or loud noises. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=65.06s)]
*  They even have noise-canceling headphones for them and sunglasses because they've been [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=68.86s)]
*  held so long in rooms or even underground. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=72.68s)]
*  They want to just make sure that they're comfortable. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=75.66s)]
*  We are learning also at this hour that in addition to the 13 women and children that [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=77.78s)]
*  will come out in this first group as part of this four-day ceasefire agreement brokered [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=82.18s)]
*  by the Qataris, there is a parallel agreement that is going to allow 12 Thai hostages to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=86.34s)]
*  come out of Gaza today released by Hamas as part of a separate negotiation. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=92.26s)]
*  Now, these hostages were taken into Gaza also on October 7th, many of them workers that [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=96.38000000000001s)]
*  were in the small communities along the border with Gaza. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=101.74000000000001s)]
*  So an indication that 25 people total, if this all goes through, could get out of Gaza [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=105.02000000000001s)]
*  today as part of these two parallel deals. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=109.46000000000001s)]
*  Griff, Molly? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=111.98s)]
*  Trey, you talked about the two options. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=113.62s)]
*  Will they be flown? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=116.54s)]
*  Will they be driven in a bus? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=117.7s)]
*  Just orient for our viewers, if you will, the proximity to Hatharim Air Base where you [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=119.62s)]
*  are and where the expected release of these hostages is taking place at the Egyptian border. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=123.94s)]
*  Yeah, great question. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=134.42000000000002s)]
*  So I want you to visualize a map of Israel. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=135.34s)]
*  And in the southwest corner, you have the border with the Gaza Strip and then you have [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=137.58s)]
*  the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=141.7s)]
*  And on the southern part of the Gaza Strip, you have the Rafa Crossing. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=142.73999999999998s)]
*  This is the second largest crossing. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=145.66s)]
*  It's the crossing between Egypt and Gaza. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=147.61999999999998s)]
*  And so they will be released into the hands of the Red Cross there. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=150.66s)]
*  They'll cross into Egypt and then they will head east with the Red Cross. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=153.57999999999998s)]
*  This will be all monitored by the Israelis. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=157.66s)]
*  They'll cross into Israel through a crossing that's normally used actually to evaluate [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=159.57999999999998s)]
*  trucks and a security crossing for goods. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=164.23999999999998s)]
*  They will come into Israel. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=168.64s)]
*  At that moment, the decision will be made based on the condition of these hostages [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=170.38s)]
*  to either fly them to Hatharim Air Base where we're at right now or drive them. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=174.18s)]
*  This is an air base that sits outside of the southern Israeli city of Perseva. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=178.78s)]
*  Perseva is a large community in southern Israel. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=183.38s)]
*  It's a place quite close to the Gaza border. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=186.66s)]
*  It takes about an hour to drive from the Gaza border to this location. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=188.74s)]
*  And then from here, they'll either go by ambulance or to helicopters and they'll be taken to [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=192.54s)]
*  regional hospitals. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=197.56s)]
*  The bottom line here is the Israeli officials want to make this as comfortable as possible [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=199.04s)]
*  for the hostages. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=202.5s)]
*  We understand that they will have a soldier assigned to every individual hostage. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=203.8s)]
*  The soldiers are all women from what we understand. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=208.24s)]
*  They want to ensure that they're not putting these vulnerable mothers and children in a [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=211.26s)]
*  situation where they would fear any additional fear than what they've already experienced, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=216.22s)]
*  the true hell on earth over the past nearly 50 days being held inside Gaza. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=220.28s)]
*  And when they get to the further medical treatment, they will have psychologists and they will [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=224.76s)]
*  also have doctors around the clock making sure that they are okay. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=228.92s)]
*  I'm just getting a note from my producer right now. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=232.72s)]
*  According to Israeli media, the hostages are now with the Red Cross. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=234.72s)]
*  So again, they're not yet in Israel, but they're with the Red Cross. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=238.83999999999997s)]
*  This means the plan is moving forward as expected. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  They'll go into the hands of the Red Cross, where we understand, according to Israeli [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=245.6s)]
*  media, they are right now, that update just coming in. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=248.48s)]
*  They then will be delivered into Israeli custody and they'll be able to make phone calls once [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=251.48s)]
*  they arrive here at the HaTzerim air base to loved ones. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=255.83999999999997s)]
*  Also something to note, Israeli media already reporting that family members have been notified. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=258.72s)]
*  We don't have the names of these hostages yet. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=263.32000000000005s)]
*  Later in the day we will. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=265.20000000000005s)]
*  But those family members have been notified they are on the way to the hospitals now in [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=266.40000000000003s)]
*  central Israel. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=270.36s)]
*  It is going to be just a moment of relief for the entire population here that truly [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=271.36s)]
*  has experienced a collective trauma, but also for these family members that have just been [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=275.64000000000004s)]
*  waiting for nearly seven weeks for any information about their children and their loved ones. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=279.56s)]
*  Significant news there, Trey. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=285.44000000000005s)]
*  The hostages on the move now in the hands of the Red Cross as this plays out. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=287.0s)]
*  The truce that went into motion at midnight essentially here in the East Coast now has [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=292.04s)]
*  been holding for some nine hours. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=297.88s)]
*  But I just want to ask you one big picture question, Trey, because we spoke with Shahara [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=300.12s)]
*  Zaneh, the former Israeli consulate spokesperson, a few minutes ago and he said, look, make [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=305.48s)]
*  this process is over. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=312.6s)]
*  It does not detour the Israeli government and Prime Minister Netanyahu's ultimate goal [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=314.8s)]
*  of eradicating Hamas. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=320.36s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=323.20000000000005s)]
*  And look, the bottom line for the Israelis is that they've made very clear once this [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=326.16s)]
*  ceasefire is over, they will go back pushing forward with their military plans inside the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=330.32000000000005s)]
*  Gaza Strip. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=334.92s)]
*  I just want to give you some color from inside Gaza. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=335.92s)]
*  I've been talking with civilians today who are inside and they say this is a moment of [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=338.08s)]
*  relief for the more than two million Palestinians who are living under Hamas rule still in the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=342.71999999999997s)]
*  southern part of the Strip. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=347.4s)]
*  And now that the Israeli air and ground campaign has been paused, they're in the streets, they're [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=349.44s)]
*  going to some markets and even some images of Palestinians going to the beach today just [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=353.71999999999997s)]
*  to have a moment of clarity and a moment of relief because there are so many civilians [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=358.4s)]
*  there who have been caught amid this war. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=363.44s)]
*  With that said, Israeli officials and we were with military officials and soldiers inside [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=366.04s)]
*  the Gaza Strip just a couple days ago getting a firsthand look at these battles. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=370.88s)]
*  They say they are remaining on high alert. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=374.92s)]
*  They understand that this lull in fighting could be an opportunity for Hamas and Islamic [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=376.8s)]
*  Jihad to reorganize, to move assets and weapons to different parts of Gaza using the tunnel [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=380.8s)]
*  network beneath the Strip so that they're prepared when this ceasefire ends to start [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=386.2s)]
*  ambushing Israeli forces again to continue the battle. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=390.84s)]
*  And remember, the estimates are just a few thousand Hamas fighters have been killed since [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=394.0s)]
*  this war began nearly seven weeks ago. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=398.12s)]
*  There are tens of thousands that remain and that's not counting the leadership that has [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=400.76s)]
*  now moved to southern cities like Hanunis and Ra'afah, the second and third largest [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=404.52s)]
*  cities respectively in Gaza, where they are now holed up in tunnels, in shelters, in bunkers. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=408.16s)]
*  And so it's critical to talk about this here because when we look at the big picture, we [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=414.44s)]
*  are looking at a temporary pause in the fighting. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=418.34s)]
*  It is a pause that will bring much relief to the civilian population on both sides of [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=421.03999999999996s)]
*  the fence and hopefully as we have reported here, 13 Israeli hostages at least coming [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=424.47999999999996s)]
*  home today and then more to follow with a total of 50 if this does go forward. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=429.28s)]
*  But the fighting will resume. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=434.3s)]
*  Four days from now, if the extension is not put into place and more hostages are released, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=435.68s)]
*  Israel will resume their air and ground campaign against Gaza with two major goals. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=441.32s)]
*  Those goals are to find the rest of the hostages and bring them home and destroy Hamas leadership. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=445.24s)]
*  And Trey, talk to us just for a moment about the fighting. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=450.6s)]
*  Is you so well laid out there because in the northern part of the Gaza Strip, you have [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=454.08s)]
*  Gaza City. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=459.68s)]
*  That's where you did incredible reporting in the tunnels. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=460.68s)]
*  But Hanunis, the southernmost city where you say a lot of the fight may go, how will that [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=463.88s)]
*  fighting differ perhaps to what we've seen in the north? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=469.84000000000003s)]
*  Look, largely we've discussed Gaza City as being a Hamas stronghold. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=474.08000000000004s)]
*  The Israeli military early in the war told us they believed 80 percent of Hamas fighters [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=480.12s)]
*  and leadership was in Gaza. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=484.24s)]
*  Well, the majority have moved to the south now, understanding that Israeli forces have [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=485.68s)]
*  spent weeks operating in the northern part of the Strip. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=489.28000000000003s)]
*  They have many neighborhoods completely locked down. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=492.28000000000003s)]
*  They are going block by block with tanks and APCs and infantry troops to secure that area. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=494.48s)]
*  But remember the leader of the military wing of Hamas, the man behind all of this responsible [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=499.68s)]
*  for organizing and carrying out the October 7th massacre, Yahya Sinwar. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=504.47999999999996s)]
*  He's known as the butcher of Hanunis, Gaza's second largest city. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=509.03999999999996s)]
*  And he is believed to be in Hanunis right now with fighters in that network of tunnels [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=512.84s)]
*  beneath the ground preparing for the battle ahead. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=517.8s)]
*  And so when we look at the days and weeks ahead, we are looking at a difficult battle [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=520.92s)]
*  for Israeli forces. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=524.64s)]
*  Remember, they've told more than two million civilians to evacuate to the southern part [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=525.64s)]
*  of the Strip. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=529.44s)]
*  The United Nations estimates nearly 80 percent of Gazans are internally displaced and they [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=530.44s)]
*  are now in the southern part of Gaza. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=535.44s)]
*  And so Israel has to look at their map and their plan right now. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=537.6s)]
*  And they're going to use these four days to do so to figure out what comes next and how [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=541.24s)]
*  they are going to operate in that heavily populated area to go after Hamas leadership. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=544.8800000000001s)]
*  Griff, Mollye. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=549.9200000000001s)]
*  Trey Yngst on the ground in Hatsanom Air Base where Fox News has now confirmed hostages [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=551.72s)]
*  are on their way. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=556.8000000000001s)]
*  Trey, we'll check back in with you as news breaks. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06XnyRL90AE&t=558.08s)]
