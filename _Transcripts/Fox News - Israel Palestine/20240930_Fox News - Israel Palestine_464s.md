# Israel to launch 'limited incursion' into Lebanon
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [September 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M)
*  We reported it here live right here on the Faulkner Focus. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=0.0s)]
*  A senior U.S. official is telling Fox News Israel will launch a limited ground incursion [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  into South Lebanon. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=11.28s)]
*  And that move is imminent. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=13.32s)]
*  You can see images of Israel lining up its tanks along the northern border with Lebanon, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  also massing troops there. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=20.92s)]
*  The region is bracing for Iran to retaliate over the killing of top Hezbollah and Hamas [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=23.72s)]
*  leaders now in a series of Israel Defense Force strikes. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=29.34s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke directly to the people of Iran. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=34.42s)]
*  Iran's tyrants don't care about your future, but you do. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=38.5s)]
*  When Iran is finally free, and that moment will come a lot sooner than people think, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=44.5s)]
*  everything will be different. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=50.019999999999996s)]
*  I know you don't support the rapists and murderers of Hamas and Hezbollah, but your leaders do. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=51.019999999999996s)]
*  You deserve more. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=57.5s)]
*  The people of Iran should know Israel stands with you. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=58.5s)]
*  Iran has promised to hit back at Israel after the IDF carried out a major airstrike inside [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=65.3s)]
*  the capital of Lebanon last week. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=71.94s)]
*  In Beirut, that strike killed and eliminated a longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=75.22s)]
*  Here's a reaction from lawmakers. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=84.06s)]
*  I think the IDF sent a powerful message to Hezbollah. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=86.82s)]
*  This has been a really challenging situation that they've been faced with, and they've [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=92.17999999999999s)]
*  got to do something about it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=96.58s)]
*  I think if Nasrallah was still alive, the threat of a broader conflict is even higher. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=98.53999999999999s)]
*  So Israel has no choice but to defend itself. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=102.38s)]
*  And so wiping out not just Nasrallah, but the senior leadership of this evil organization, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=105.02s)]
*  I think is a service to humanity. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=109.53999999999999s)]
*  And you heard me mention that word of elimination. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=112.14s)]
*  That is that whole leadership line that that you see Senator Rubio talking about today. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=115.30000000000001s)]
*  The Pentagon is making plans of its own as the conflict there is getting hotter. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=120.38000000000001s)]
*  Chief National Correspondent of Security, as you can see, Jennifer Griffin is with me, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=125.18s)]
*  and she's at the Pentagon. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=129.34s)]
*  Jennifer. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=130.5s)]
*  Harris, a senior U.S. official, as you mentioned, told our own Liz Frieden that a limited ground [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=131.5s)]
*  incursion by the IDF into south Lebanon is imminent. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=136.70000000000002s)]
*  It will be smaller, we're told, than in 2006 and shorter in nature. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=140.62s)]
*  Not wanting to the fighting to escalate, President Biden called for a ceasefire and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=145.06s)]
*  was adamant that he would not send more U.S. troops to the Middle East. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=149.06s)]
*  But the Pentagon is deploying 700 National Guard soldiers from Tennessee and 600 from [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=153.38s)]
*  the Indiana National Guard as part of normal troop rotations. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=158.58s)]
*  This is on top of the 40,000 American troops already in the region on heightened readiness. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=162.86s)]
*  The Pentagon announced Sunday the USS Wasp Amphibious Ready Group and the 24th Marine [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=168.18s)]
*  Expeditionary Unit will remain in the eastern Mediterranean in case a potential evacuation [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=173.34s)]
*  of U.S. citizens from Lebanon is needed. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=178.98s)]
*  We have to be prepared for some sort of response. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=182.94s)]
*  We have to make sure that we are ready, and we are. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=185.66s)]
*  We believe we have the force capability we need in the region, but it's not clear right [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=187.95999999999998s)]
*  now, too soon to know, how Iran's going to react to this. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=191.34s)]
*  The Pentagon said in a statement, quote, We will further reinforce our defensive air [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=195.26s)]
*  support capabilities in the coming days. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=199.34s)]
*  The USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group is in the Middle East to send a deterrent [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=201.82s)]
*  message to Iran with the hope of preventing attacks from Iran and its proxy forces. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=206.04s)]
*  But that deterrent message is apparently lost on the Houthis. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=211.48s)]
*  Three U.S. warships came under attack off the coast of Yemen from a barrage of nearly [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=215.26s)]
*  two dozen Iranian-backed Houthi ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as drones, on [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=220.0s)]
*  Friday, targeting the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers USS Stockdale and [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=225.02s)]
*  USS Spruance and the USS Indianapolis Littoral Combat Ship, who were transiting the Bab al-Mendab [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=230.36s)]
*  Strait. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=237.08s)]
*  None of the vessels were hit and no sailors on board were hurt, a U.S. official told Fox. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=238.08s)]
*  The U.S. warships facing attack shot down most of the incoming missiles. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=243.56s)]
*  The others landed in the sea. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=247.52s)]
*  The U.S. has not struck back against Houthi targets in Yemen following this unprecedented [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=249.36s)]
*  attack on U.S. naval vessels. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=253.96s)]
*  Harris? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  But Israel has. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=256.92s)]
*  Israel hit Yemen yesterday. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=257.92s)]
*  Maybe even on our behalf we could benefit from their fight. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=260.48s)]
*  Jennifer, thank you. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=263.92s)]
*  Robert Greenway, a former Defense Intelligence Agency officer, now Director of the Center [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=265.6s)]
*  for National Defense at the Heritage Foundation, is in focus. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=270.0s)]
*  Let's start there. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=273.52000000000004s)]
*  Let's talk about what Israel is willing to do to the enemy and what we have not done [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=274.52000000000004s)]
*  to the enemy in terms of how many times, hundreds of times, they've hit our men and women in [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=278.76s)]
*  the Middle East, just in the last year. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=282.56s)]
*  That's absolutely right, Harrison. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=286.44s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=287.8s)]
*  We've seen Israel decapitate Hezbollah in dramatic fashion, a limited ground incursion [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=288.88s)]
*  necessary and inevitable in many ways. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=294.12s)]
*  How it starts is not necessarily how it will finish. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=297.04s)]
*  You're right that we've been attacked over 180 times in Iraq and Syria without responding [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=299.44s)]
*  to the most recent casualties. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=303.54s)]
*  And now, as Jennifer pointed out, you acknowledge that we've been attacked again now some 220 [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=305.48s)]
*  times by the Houthis in the Red Sea without a U.S. response. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=311.12s)]
*  Obviously, the Houthis know that the Israelis are responding. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=313.88s)]
*  One ballistic missile warrants attack on gas infrastructure in Hudaytaport. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=316.6s)]
*  That's the model, and we ought to be doing the same thing. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=320.52000000000004s)]
*  So, Robert, why don't we attack the same way and retaliate in the same way? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=322.64000000000004s)]
*  We have the power to do it. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=327.46000000000004s)]
*  Absolutely do. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=330.84000000000003s)]
*  And of course, deterrence is a combination of capacity and capability and fear imparted [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=331.84000000000003s)]
*  in the enemy, and we haven't yet done it. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=335.64000000000004s)]
*  The fear is what's driving U.S. policy. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=337.36s)]
*  We're afraid of escalation, and we have been for the beginning. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=339.32000000000005s)]
*  Of course, that's the fastest way to get there. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  And right now, the region is spiraling out of control. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=343.8s)]
*  The U.S. is a bystander in all of it. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=346.48s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=349.04s)]
*  Deterrence. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=350.04s)]
*  You mean like when Biden says don't and then Iran does. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=351.04s)]
*  Let's get to this. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=354.48s)]
*  Hezbollah has been linked to several anti-United States attacks since the 1980s. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=355.48s)]
*  The groups attacking against Americans includes the suicide truck bombings in 1983 and 1984 [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=361.12s)]
*  in Beirut, which targeted the U.S. Embassy, the U.S. Marine Barracks, and the U.S. Embassy [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  annex. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=373.2s)]
*  The death toll in just those attacks was more than 300 Americans and Lebanese citizens. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=374.2s)]
*  Robert, we are up against an enemy that will hit us, Iran, or do you think it won't? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=381.12s)]
*  Do you think it'll continue to just fan out with these proxies, or is there something [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=387.6s)]
*  greater coming? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=391.68s)]
*  Well, I think we can say two things for sure, that the region is not going to quiet down [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=393.16s)]
*  anytime soon, that Iran will continue to employ its surrogates as long as there's no cost [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=398.0s)]
*  presented. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=401.68s)]
*  It's going to complete its nuclear weapons program, and it gets closer every passing [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=403.36s)]
*  day. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=406.48s)]
*  Under the Biden-Harris administration, it's been able to make unprecedented progress. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=407.48s)]
*  It's now effectively at zero breakout. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=410.52s)]
*  And if we think they're irresponsible with missiles and drones, I wonder what they'll [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=412.76s)]
*  do with nuclear weapons. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=416.44s)]
*  It's a catastrophic eventuality we can't allow to have happen. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=418.0s)]
*  I have 10 seconds. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=420.88s)]
*  Do you feel like you know enough about what Kamala Harris would do if she had to take [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=421.88s)]
*  over now or would win the election in November? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=426.48s)]
*  Well, I think we're watching it in real time, and we can't afford to see a continuation [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=430.35999999999996s)]
*  of it. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GapiWTQYb0M&t=435.2s)]
