# Iran wants to 'strike fear' in Israel: GOP senator
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4)
*  Let's bring in Iowa Senator Joni Ernst who was kind enough to join us tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=0.0s)]
*  So we're both good friends with John Androsik. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=4.32s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=6.12s)]
*  And you pointed out what he said there, that Biden said ahead of what happened tonight, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=7.12s)]
*  to Iran, don't. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  And Iran said, whatever. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Now Iran may be going to pains here to not hit any population centers, but what do you [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=15.56s)]
*  make of the fact that they completely thumbed their nose at the American president? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=21.72s)]
*  Well, Jon, and I do hope John Androsik is safe. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=26.52s)]
*  We wish him well. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=30.52s)]
*  We wish our friends in Israel well. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=31.52s)]
*  But this has been three and a half years of failed policy coming out of this administration. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  If you go back and the sanctions that were put in place by the Biden administration on [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=40.92s)]
*  Iranian oil, but were never enforced, never enforced. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=48.04s)]
*  So if you're going to throw that out there, if you're going to talk, you might as well [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=52.8s)]
*  walk the walk as well. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=56.16s)]
*  We don't see the Biden administration doing that. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=57.76s)]
*  So over the course of the last five years, we've hit an all time high of export of Iranian [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=60.64s)]
*  oil to the tune of 80 billion dollars that goes to fund Iran and its terror proxy groups, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=66.6s)]
*  which are targeting not only American troops, but Israel as well. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=73.88s)]
*  So we have come to a culmination now of failure in policy to deter Iran against attacking [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=77.84s)]
*  Israel as well as our American troops. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=84.52s)]
*  Senator, it's good to have you on the program tonight. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=87.48s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=89.8s)]
*  As you can imagine, world leaders continue to respond to what we are all watching play [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  out on the world stage tonight. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=96.1s)]
*  The German chancellor has just issued a statement saying the attack on Israel territory that [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=98.36s)]
*  Iran launched tonight is unjustifiable and highly irresponsible. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=103.88s)]
*  This just coming in. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=107.88s)]
*  Iran risks a further escalation in the region. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=108.88s)]
*  He stands by Israel and we will discuss the situation with our allies. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=111.44s)]
*  You have to imagine world leaders all over are watching this play out and having to plan [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=115.72s)]
*  for what may be coming next, Senator. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=123.52s)]
*  Exactly, Sandra. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=126.28s)]
*  And we do have to wonder what will happen next. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=128.44s)]
*  Now we did have a little bit of a heads up that Iran planned to do this. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=131.28s)]
*  They were telling the world that they were going to strike Israel. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=135.6s)]
*  What is the next step following this? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=139.96s)]
*  Because we know that Israel is intent on wiping out Hamas. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=143.72s)]
*  Again, another policy failure coming from this administration is waffling on the support [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=147.84s)]
*  to Israel. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=153.28s)]
*  We should not be interfering with their war. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=154.44s)]
*  We should say to Israel, we support you. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=157.48000000000002s)]
*  We will help you wipe this scourge off of the face of the planet. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=160.72s)]
*  This president has not done that. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=165.24s)]
*  We need to step forward, make sure we're protecting our own interests in the Middle [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=167.48s)]
*  East, which includes defending Israel. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=171.72s)]
*  We were all fascinated by Jennifer Griffin's reporting about these Shahed drones that were [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=175.16s)]
*  lit up. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=180.04s)]
*  You were in the military. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=181.04s)]
*  You know military strategy. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=182.45999999999998s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=183.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=184.78s)]
*  So John, back to our conversation earlier, we were noticing those lights on those drones. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=185.78s)]
*  Now I immediately thought this is one way to strike terror into the citizens there in [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=192.08s)]
*  Israel. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  You also pointed out that this is one way to identify those drones. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=199.64000000000001s)]
*  They can be easier shot down. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=203.78s)]
*  So twofold. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=207.12s)]
*  I think maybe Iran did not intend for those missiles or drones to land. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=208.74s)]
*  That's possible. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=214.8s)]
*  But I still think it's all about fear. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=215.8s)]
*  It is about striking fear in the hearts of Israelis. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=218.48000000000002s)]
*  We saw this with Hamas. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=222.04s)]
*  That was a tactic they were using as well. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=223.84s)]
*  They want Israelis to exist wondering what is going to happen next. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=226.42s)]
*  Am I safe? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=233.16s)]
*  Are my family members safe? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  If you wonder that all the time, it does degrade on your quality of life. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=236.48s)]
*  So certainly I think there were a number of aspects that Iran was engaging in when they [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=243.23999999999998s)]
*  sent those Shaheed missiles or drones into Israel. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=248.2s)]
*  Senator, to add to our continued reporting here and updates coming directly from Israel, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=252.16s)]
*  the Israeli military has revised its earlier alert saying there's no requirement in place [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=256.8s)]
*  right now anywhere in the country for residents to prepare to take shelter. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=261.88s)]
*  If that changes, they will advise residents. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=265.71999999999997s)]
*  Continued reaction pouring in, this one from your colleague in the Senate, Mike Braun. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=269.56s)]
*  The U.S. must not abandon our ally Israel as they defend themselves from this vicious [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=273.24s)]
*  attack. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=277.52s)]
*  We're praying for the lives of innocent civilians in Israel tonight and the Jewish people all [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=279.04s)]
*  around the world. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=282.68s)]
*  And to add to Jen Griffin's reporting, per two U.S. officials confirming Iran fired both [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=284.04s)]
*  ballistic and land attack cruise missiles at Israel in addition to the attack drones. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=290.90000000000003s)]
*  This is the first confirmation she says that we have that ballistic and cruise missiles [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=298.26s)]
*  were fired at Israel by Iran. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=302.36s)]
*  I can only imagine and we can only imagine as we watch on, Senator, what the coming hours [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=305.0s)]
*  will look like. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=310.12s)]
*  Yes, Sandra, this is unprecedented for Iran not to utilize those proxies but to strike [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=311.47999999999996s)]
*  directly against Israel and to engage with ballistic missiles. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=320.28s)]
*  So the thoughts that I have heard coming from other colleagues, other people within the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=326.47999999999996s)]
*  makes you wonder how close are they also to having those nuclear capabilities. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=332.56s)]
*  So they want Israelis to exist in fear, wondering what that next step will be. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=339.08s)]
*  But again, it is unprecedented what Iran has done and we have got to assist the Israelis [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=345.15999999999997s)]
*  any way possible to push back against this threat. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=352.4s)]
*  Now we do see Saudi Arabia stepping up. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=356.03999999999996s)]
*  We see Jordan stepping up. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=359.8s)]
*  We want to thank those Arab nations that are friends to Israel, engaged through the Abraham [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=361.6s)]
*  Accords and other partnerships. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=366.26000000000005s)]
*  This is part of the Defend Act which passed bipartisan. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=368.46000000000004s)]
*  I led that effort in the Senate many years ago. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=371.88s)]
*  But to tie all of these nations together in an air defense mechanism so that they could [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=375.44s)]
*  protect against Iran. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=381.52000000000004s)]
*  So we see the successes when America chooses to lead. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=383.76000000000005s)]
*  This is what we need at this moment is American leadership that will step forward and support [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=388.92s)]
*  Israel. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=394.36s)]
*  You know, just thinking about what you said just a moment ago regarding Iran and its nuclear [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=395.36s)]
*  program, you know, this could have also been a sign to Israel that, hey, once we get a [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=399.92s)]
*  nuke we can reach you without any problem. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=402.76s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=405.59999999999997s)]
*  No matter how you put it, the genie is out of the bottle here. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=407.15999999999997s)]
*  That there has been a direct attack by Iran on Israel. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=410.0s)]
*  Israel has attacked Iran before but Iran didn't attack Israel. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=413.36s)]
*  Now that Iran has attacked Israel, do you think that Israel will sit on its hands and [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=418.4s)]
*  say, look, it wasn't so bad, a 10-year-old girl got slightly hurt but there was nothing [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=422.71999999999997s)]
*  else or will they say, you can't do that, we're coming for you? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=427.2s)]
*  I think we have seen Israel step up. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=432.35999999999996s)]
*  After October 7th they said, no more, this will not happen again. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=435.46s)]
*  So I do anticipate some strong reaction coming from Israel. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=440.38s)]
*  What do you think Biden will tell them? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=443.47999999999996s)]
*  I can't speak for Biden. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=445.76s)]
*  I would never want to speak for Biden. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=447.28s)]
*  I can't get in his mind, again, the failures of this president for so many years now to [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=449.44s)]
*  actually step forward and enable Israel to do the right thing in defending its own home [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=455.76s)]
*  territory. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=461.55999999999995s)]
*  Joe Biden has failed at every opportunity. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=462.55999999999995s)]
*  I have a bill right now in the United States Senate, there's a companion bill, it's bipartisan [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=466.03999999999996s)]

*  They need to do this. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=478.22s)]
*  We need to cut off the revenues that are going to Iran. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=479.38s)]
*  We need to choke them out so they can't keep perpetuating these types of actions against [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=482.1s)]

*  Senator, when you head to work Monday morning, what does this look like? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=492.6s)]
*  We know we heard from McConnell earlier today, we must pass the supplemental. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=497.84s)]
*  What is that conversation going to look like in Congress as the U.S. stands by Israel? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjCyv4KYHJ4&t=502.88s)]
