# ‘DEEPLY CONCERNING’: Biden admin has a ‘soft spot’ for Iran, says Mike Pompeo
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY)
*  There is a growing divide within the federal government over official U.S. policy toward [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=8.84s)]
*  A push for a ceasefire is gaining momentum as hundreds of members inside the Biden administration [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=9.84s)]
*  tell the president they do not agree with how he's handling the conflict. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=14.6s)]
*  Joining me now, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=18.96s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, welcome back. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=21.28s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=22.28s)]
*  It's great to be with you, Shannon. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=23.28s)]
*  Okay, so this letter that has been joined now by hundreds of people, different things [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=25.28s)]
*  bubbling up from state, from the White House, from DOJ, you've written this this week. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=29.96s)]
*  The American people should be alarmed and outraged that individuals who are so clearly [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=33.88s)]
*  opposed to our constitutional order and so plainly ignorant of right and wrong work on [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=38.44s)]
*  U.S. foreign policy every day. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=44.08s)]
*  Why is this not a free speech issue? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=46.24s)]
*  Well, they're entitled to their free speech. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=49.08s)]
*  They're also entitled to work wherever the heck they want. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  But in our country, the people who work for the president of the United States and the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=55.64s)]
*  confirmed secretary of state of the United States of America have an obligation to do [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=58.32s)]
*  the work that they direct them to do, not their own, Shannon, not their own vision for [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=62.28s)]
*  what America ought to look like. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=66.28s)]
*  And Shannon, I saw this when I was secretary of state. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=67.8s)]
*  These attacks on the bureaucratic efforts, these from the bureaucratic efforts are always [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=70.48s)]
*  from the left. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=74.58s)]
*  It's always from progress. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=75.58s)]
*  You don't see dissent cables from those of us who believe in the deep Judeo-Christian [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=76.58s)]
*  tradition. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=80.56s)]
*  It is always from progressives. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=81.56s)]
*  And they not only write about them, they not only speak about them. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=83.16s)]
*  That's what this letter is. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=86.12s)]
*  They then work diligently to undermine what it is these administrations are trying to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=87.56s)]
*  do. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=91.56s)]
*  So today they ought to all be doing what President Biden and Secretary Blinken want them to do. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=92.56s)]
*  It was most unfortunate that many of them didn't want to work on the projects that I [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=95.72s)]
*  and President Trump asked them to do. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  It is dangerous, Shannon, that their task is to perform what the executive directs and [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=100.88s)]
*  they believe they have a right to voice their opinions and undermine American policy. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=105.28s)]
*  That's both wrong as a moral principle and it's deeply a constitutional. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=111.47999999999999s)]
*  There are several media outlets reporting about some specific folks working within the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  Biden administration semaphore, the New York Post, the Federalist. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  They're all talking about people they've named that they say are either sympathizers with [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=121.44s)]
*  Iranian leadership or people that have actually lobbied for the aims of Iranian leaders. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=125.28s)]
*  One of them works at the Pentagon and dozens of senators have written a letter to the White [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=130.6s)]
*  House saying that her security clearance should be suspended. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=134.0s)]
*  We can't find any record that it has been. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=137.12s)]
*  Here's the headline this week from the Federalist. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=139.32s)]
*  They say this. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=140.92s)]
*  No serious country would allow terrorist sympathizers to run its government. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=141.92s)]
*  Are you surprised by these allegations, as most of us average Americans are, that this [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  would be going on within the U.S. government? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=151.12s)]
*  I'm most surprised that the administration hasn't put this person onward, hadn't gotten [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  them out of the Department of Defense. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=160.68s)]
*  She's working in an organization that controls and operates our special operating forces [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=161.68s)]
*  around the world at a time of deep conflict. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=166.36s)]
*  Look, this administration has always had a soft spot for the Islamic Republic of Iran. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=168.96s)]
*  We saw it in President Obama when they signed the JCPOA. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=173.96s)]
*  We've now seen it while they've launched dozens and dozens of attacks against Americans. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=177.36s)]
*  We've done almost nothing. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=181.28s)]
*  I'm not so sure that these views that are held by this woman and who were held by Robert [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=183.76000000000002s)]
*  Malley, who was the special envoy for Iran who's had his security clearance suspended, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=187.72000000000003s)]
*  that frankly, it's not so much that they're outliers in this administration. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=192.8s)]
*  It is that their policies are deeply consistent with what President Biden has been trying [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=196.16s)]
*  to do. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=200.24s)]
*  I'm very worried about what the Islamic Republic of Iran is doing, not only today in supporting [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=201.24s)]
*  Hamas and the Houthis and Hezbollah in Lebanon, but what they may be doing at our southern [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=206.56s)]
*  border, bringing folks into our country and presenting real risk here in the homeland [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=211.12s)]
*  as well. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=214.72s)]
*  Well, and to that point, I mean, you've seen the data. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=215.72s)]
*  You've served on the job. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=217.64s)]
*  We keep hearing about what a problem the border is. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=218.88s)]
*  This administration has talked about the possibility that it's very attractive to terrorists. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=222.64s)]
*  We talked with Senator Coons about the fact that there are millions of people here. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=226.06s)]
*  We don't know who they are or where they are. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=228.92000000000002s)]
*  Is that something that keeps you up at night? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=231.48s)]
*  How worried should we be? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=232.94s)]
*  Because new polling shows that Americans are worried about Islamic terror attacks on U.S. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=234.2s)]
*  soil. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=239.48s)]
*  Now 73% of them. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=240.48s)]
*  That's up 23 points since May. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=241.58s)]
*  Shannon, it's something I'm deeply concerned about. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=244.62s)]
*  I heard Senator Coons' remarks. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=248.02s)]
*  He's a good and decent man. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=249.64000000000001s)]
*  He's just wrong about the Biden administration on the border. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=251.32s)]
*  This isn't about proper asylum claims. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=254.0s)]
*  This is about a couple million folks who we have no idea where they are inside of the [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=255.76s)]
*  United States. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=259.4s)]
*  And the attacks now, six weeks on, on October 7th, were in the planning for months, if not [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=260.8s)]
*  years. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=264.76s)]
*  Goodness knows what might be taking place inside the United States that has also been [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=265.76s)]
*  planned by Iran over the last months and years. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=269.36s)]
*  It's a real risk. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=272.04s)]
*  They've tried to blow up things here in the United States before. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=273.12s)]
*  They continue to threaten to assassinate former American officials and American civilians [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=275.94s)]
*  as well. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=279.94s)]
*  They've made clear their intention to do so. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=280.94s)]
*  It's a very real risk. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=282.6s)]
*  If we don't know who's coming into our country, Shannon, it's pretty straightforward. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=283.62s)]
*  No matter what Senator Coons tells you, that risk is greater. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=286.78000000000003s)]
*  Don't take my word for it. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=289.82000000000005s)]
*  Take a word of Mayor Adams in New York City. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=291.12s)]
*  Take the word of Director Wray. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=293.06s)]
*  They know these are real risks in their cities and in their country as well. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=294.54s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=297.54s)]
*  So with news of a potential ceasefire deal, let's pivot back to the Middle East. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=298.54s)]
*  There is no debate that there are civilian lives that are being lost in Gaza over the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=301.74s)]
*  current operations. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=305.98s)]
*  Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, who is a Palestinian American herself, is among those calling not [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=307.46000000000004s)]
*  just for this humanitarian cause, but she wants a ceasefire. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=311.88s)]
*  And here's what she's saying this weekend about U.S. continued support for Israel. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=314.56s)]
*  We're done supporting and funding this violence. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=318.36s)]
*  We're done watching children being pulled out of a rubble, blood coming down their faces. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=322.52000000000004s)]
*  We're tired of allowing, you know, folks to be able to think that the answer to war crimes [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=328.52000000000004s)]
*  on October 7th was more war crimes. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=334.12s)]
*  So how do you answer these growing concerns about the number? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=337.34000000000003s)]
*  The reality of civilian deaths that are happening right now in Gaza? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=340.9s)]
*  Shannon, the singular best way to protect the people that are living in the Gaza Strip [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=346.9s)]
*  is the destruction and annihilation of Hamas. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=351.14s)]
*  It's pretty straightforward. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=353.21999999999997s)]
*  It should be done as quickly as possible. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=354.21999999999997s)]

*  have not been good lives. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=359.82s)]
*  The fact that Israel is now determined to do it is something that is both decent and [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=361.94s)]
*  moral and good for the people living there, good for the people of Israel, and great for [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=365.46s)]
*  the United States of America as well. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=369.0s)]
*  You know, I listened to her talk. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=371.2s)]
*  There's a lot of discussion about what's going to happen the day after, Shannon. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=372.56s)]
*  Think about what the day after looks like if Hamas is not destroyed. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=376.08s)]
*  If Hamas is not destroyed, this destruction, this death will continue. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=379.56s)]
*  Iran will feel like it got an enormous victory, and the Russians, the Chinese, and the Iranians [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=383.88s)]
*  will all continue their terror campaigns and their efforts all across the globe if they [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=389.28s)]
*  think the West isn't prepared to do the most basic task of government, and that is to protect [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=393.04s)]
*  its own citizens. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=397.64s)]
*  I hope that Israel will do this quickly. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=398.65999999999997s)]
*  I hope that they will do this with enormous decency and protect civilians to the maximum [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=399.9s)]
*  extent possible. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=404.38s)]
*  But the job, the requirement to destroy Hamas and to send a message to the world that the [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=405.65999999999997s)]

*  You and I have a mutual friend, Joel Rosenberg, who lives and works in the Middle East. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=415.3s)]
*  He's the editor-in-chief of All Israel News and All Arab News, a couple of sources there. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=420.78s)]
*  He has put out an urgent call for help for Christians who are in Gaza. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=425.96s)]
*  He says they're sheltering in churches. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=431.24s)]
*  We know many of them have been killed, as have thousands of other civilians. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=433.0s)]
*  He's pointing out that Israel is asking them to evacuate to the South, but he says for [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=437.12s)]
*  them that's essentially a death sentence because they don't have the shelters of where they [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=441.04s)]
*  currently are. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=444.52s)]
*  He says this, as followers of Jesus, they are considered pagans. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=445.52s)]
*  They know that they can expect no mercy from Hamas and the others in the South. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=449.02s)]
*  He goes on to say he believes their wives and daughters will be raped. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=453.44s)]
*  They will all potentially face torture and murder. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=456.66s)]
*  He's asking the Israeli government to allow them to evacuate to Christians who would take [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=459.94s)]
*  them in in the West Bank. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=463.38s)]
*  Given everything that's going on there and the millions of civilians who are in danger [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=465.38s)]
*  in Gaza, is it right, should the Israel military or government make a way for this specific [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=469.94s)]
*  group of folks to evacuate? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=476.58s)]
*  Well, Joel's certainly right. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=478.86s)]
*  Christians living in Gaza are at risk. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=482.2s)]
*  They've been at risk for years. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=484.36s)]
*  There's no doubt about that. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=485.36s)]
*  The best way to create safety and protection for the Christians that are living there, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=487.18s)]
*  I think, is, as I said before, to move on Hamas just as quickly as absolutely possible. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=490.32s)]
*  I hope the Israelis will do everything they can to protect Christians in that area. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=495.76s)]
*  Shannon, you and I have worked on this issue. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=498.84000000000003s)]
*  We worked on Christian persecution in Nigeria and in northern Iraq. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=500.52s)]
*  This is something that is near and dear to our hearts. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=505.12s)]
*  I hope the Israeli government will do everything they can. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=507.56s)]
*  I don't know that they are any safer in the north than they are in the south. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=510.46s)]
*  I don't know the situation on the ground that well. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=514.38s)]
*  But the core mission set has to be to get these hostages home, to bring them home now, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=516.7s)]
*  and to destroy Hamas as quickly and as with a little civilian loss of life as we can. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=521.5s)]
*  And when we do that, we'll protect not only the Christians that are there, but the Arabs [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=526.22s)]
*  and all of the others as well. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=530.62s)]
*  This is not good for anyone living in Gaza. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=531.94s)]
*  And Christian persecution there has been continuous in the decade past. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=534.06s)]
*  And as we know, millions of civilian lives of all backgrounds caught in the middle who [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=538.1999999999999s)]
*  want nothing to do with Hamas. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=542.68s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, thank you. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=544.28s)]
*  Always good to see you. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=545.56s)]
*  Happy Thanksgiving, Shannon. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=546.64s)]
*  Bless you. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqU9DY2w9aY&t=547.88s)]
