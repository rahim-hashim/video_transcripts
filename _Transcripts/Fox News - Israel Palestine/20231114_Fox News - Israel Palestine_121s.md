# Jesse Watters: It's time to enforce the law
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6cKsVM53NQ)
*  Dr. Sheila Nazarian is a pro-Israel activist and joins me now. So, doctor, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6cKsVM53NQ&t=0.0s)]
*  where did all this hatred come from? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6cKsVM53NQ&t=5.2s)]
*  Jesse, I really strongly believe the hatred has always been here. It's just that people are [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6cKsVM53NQ&t=8.8s)]
*  emboldened to share it out loud. And honestly, I'm pro letting them share all of those feelings and [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6cKsVM53NQ&t=13.76s)]
*  just letting us hold them accountable afterwards. But we're not. They don't even get arrested. When [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6cKsVM53NQ&t=21.36s)]
*  they do, they walk out like it's a parking ticket. They're shaking our subways crazy. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6cKsVM53NQ&t=26.64s)]
*  They're tearing down our flags. They're spray painting the White House. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6cKsVM53NQ&t=31.68s)]
*  Maybe those people at that protest didn't get held accountable. But I assure you, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6cKsVM53NQ&t=37.28s)]
*  many on college campuses, many professors, many professionals have been held accountable, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6cKsVM53NQ&t=41.04s)]
*  and we just have to do a better job. Now, it depends on who's doing the accountability. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6cKsVM53NQ&t=46.56s)]
*  As you noticed in all the protests that have been happening over the last two years from multiple [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6cKsVM53NQ&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  causes, those people weren't held accountable either. And really, it's about asking our [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6cKsVM53NQ&t=57.04s)]
*  politicians and the DAs in certain states and certain cities, why aren't these people getting [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6cKsVM53NQ&t=62.4s)]
*  held accountable? Yeah, because we don't care if you yell free Palestine. You yell that all day. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6cKsVM53NQ&t=67.44s)]
*  We don't care. But if you're going to throw haymakers in the middle of the street and you're [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6cKsVM53NQ&t=72.4s)]
*  going to throw paint on our property and climb our monuments, I don't like that. And you have to [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6cKsVM53NQ&t=76.4s)]
*  enforce the law strictly, no matter who does it and what they look like or what they're [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6cKsVM53NQ&t=81.52s)]
*  yelling about. It's interesting. It's interesting. A lot of these people left their countries where [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6cKsVM53NQ&t=86.56s)]
*  they would never have the right to protest, would not have the right to free speech. And they come [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6cKsVM53NQ&t=91.04s)]
*  to America where those beautiful rights exist, and they're using it to turn our country into [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6cKsVM53NQ&t=95.12s)]
*  the countries that they left, which makes absolutely no sense. Yeah, and if you're a conservative and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6cKsVM53NQ&t=101.2s)]
*  you protest, you get audited. So go figure. Dr. Thank you. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6cKsVM53NQ&t=104.80000000000001s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6cKsVM53NQ&t=116.56s)]
