# US must prepare to defend itself from the AI future, expert warns
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4)
*  Dana, artificial intelligence on the battlefield. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel's military has been using AI throughout its fight against the Hamas terror organization, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  sparking a debate over the ethics of using the technology in warfare. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=9.52s)]
*  Douglas Kennedy is here now with a look at both sides of the argument. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=14.76s)]
*  Douglas, what's this all about? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=18.48s)]
*  Yeah, John, recently we've seen AI write term papers and alter videos. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=19.84s)]
*  Now it's waging war. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=25.28s)]
*  So this is a real turning point in history. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=28.52s)]
*  Yeah, we've never seen this type of acceleration of targeting, of surveillance. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=31.24s)]
*  For the first time, artificial intelligence is on the battlefield in a major war. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  And it's going to change the way humans fight each other, for better or worse. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=43.12s)]
*  Matt McInnis is from the Institute for the Study of War and specializes in the Middle [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=50.36s)]
*  East and conflicts of the future. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=55.239999999999995s)]
*  For the last two years, he's watched Israel pump huge sums of money into an AI program [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=58.14s)]
*  created specifically for its military. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=64.54s)]
*  So Israel calls this Fire Factory, and it's designed to process huge amounts of information [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=67.7s)]
*  so they can act more quickly and more efficiently. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=73.86s)]
*  Yeah, Fire Factory has been the centerpiece of the Israeli Defense Force's revolution [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=76.18s)]
*  on artificial intelligence for their military operations. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=80.7s)]
*  They're bringing in intelligence from open source, from communications, from satellites, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=84.06s)]
*  from surveillance cameras, from folks on the ground, bringing that all together to make [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=88.9s)]
*  very rapid decisions in the war. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=93.38s)]
*  Fire Factory also analyzes data to choose targets for lethal munitions. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=95.58s)]
*  Israel insists its commanders have final say, but some see a leap in technology that crosses [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=102.18s)]
*  a line humans should not cross. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=108.5s)]
*  Life and death decisions should only be made by humans. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=112.06s)]
*  Max Tegmark is president of the Future of Life Institute, which opposes all AI in autonomous [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=115.62s)]
*  weapons. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=122.38s)]
*  Machines are prone to mistakes, and they lack context, and they lack the human values that [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=123.38s)]
*  have to go into these decisions. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=130.54s)]
*  McInnis acknowledges the ethical conundrum, but says AI warfare is here to stay. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=132.5s)]
*  Today, he says, we're watching Israel. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=138.54s)]
*  Tomorrow, China. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=141.06s)]
*  China has basically built its military future around AI. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=143.26000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, Xi Jinping has put AI as the center point of his modernization of the Chinese [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=147.58s)]
*  military. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=153.42000000000002s)]
*  He wants to be faster. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=154.42000000000002s)]
*  He wants to be smarter than the United States. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=155.42000000000002s)]
*  And the United States, he says, must prepare to defend itself for the AI future. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=158.38s)]
*  Back to you, Dana and John. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=163.98000000000002s)]
*  This is all moving very quickly. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=165.66000000000003s)]
*  Douglas Kennedy for us on that. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=167.66000000000003s)]
*  Douglas, thank you. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9k3Jo3Lbr4&t=169.10000000000002s)]
