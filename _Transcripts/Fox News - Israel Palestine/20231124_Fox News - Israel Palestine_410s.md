# This is a bittersweet day for Israel, official says of hostage release
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8)
*  All right, we're going to bring in now Israeli Consul General Aviv Ezra. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you, sir, for joining us today as we're watching the beginnings of the hostage and [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=3.92s)]
*  prisoner exchange happening. We've gotten word that 13 hostages have come across into Egypt, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=8.8s)]
*  that also some Thai hostages, about a dozen, have been released as well, or precisely a dozen. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=14.88s)]
*  Your thoughts as we're watching this? Well, first of all, thank you so much for having me. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=20.48s)]
*  You're 100 percent right. This is a bittersweet day for the state of Israel, for the people of [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  Israel. As one of our major two goals of this campaign is to bring back our hostages, you can [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=31.68s)]
*  see that I'm wearing right here with me the tag here that says that we will bring them back home. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=37.44s)]
*  But it's very, very important to note the following elements. First of all, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=43.44s)]
*  this is not an exchange of prisoners. In October 7th, Hamas, this vicious ISIS radical regime, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=47.44s)]
*  has actually not just butchered and raped our innocent civilians, but also kidnapped children, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=54.8s)]
*  women, elderly. And today, at this exchange, we're not talking about a prison exchange. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=61.44s)]
*  From the Israeli side, we're going to be receiving back 10-month-old babies, two years old, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=67.76s)]
*  four years old, six years old. These kids are coming back to a very, very traumatic event. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=73.6s)]
*  They have sometimes lost one of their parents. Sometimes they have lost two of their parents. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=80.8s)]
*  It's just mind-boggling to see it, and it's very emotional. On the other hand, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=85.28s)]
*  Hamas has demanded to release convicted terrorists. Yes, some of them are women. Some of them are [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=89.28s)]
*  minors at the age of 16, 17, et cetera. But they have committed violent terrorist activities against [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=95.12s)]
*  Israelis. Maybe they did not succeed in what they planned to do, but this is the exchange that we [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=102.96s)]
*  are talking about. Point number two that I want to mention is that we need to understand the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=107.92s)]
*  mechanism that we have built here was created to create incentives for Hamas to release more [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=112.72s)]
*  and more hostages. But we want to make sure that it's understood that we are talking about an event [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=118.64s)]
*  that would not have happened hadn't Israel pressed in a military campaign Hamas. Hamas is not a boy [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=124.4s)]
*  scout organization. They are not humanitarian. Obviously, we know what they did in October 7th, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=132.0s)]
*  so it makes me laugh when they look at this as they define it as a humanitarian exchange. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=136.72s)]
*  Last thing you can call them is humanitarian. But we will continue to make sure that after the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=143.68s)]
*  cessation of the fire and after the fact they will return, according to the mechanism is built, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=149.04s)]
*  return those hostages, we will make sure that we'll continue pressing it until they bring all of [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=153.76s)]
*  our hostages back home. I think you raise a great point there that the exchange that's happening is [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=158.32s)]
*  essentially innocent, completely innocent infants for three terrorists, so one to three exchange. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=163.12s)]
*  But does it give Hamas, who can't be trusted, some incentive at least to hold this temporary [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=169.36s)]
*  truce? They want their prisoners. And as Trey Yankst raised a point, that right now they are [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=175.6s)]
*  assessing the damage in Gaza during this pause. They are getting out, they are seeing what has [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=180.4s)]
*  happened. They have been essentially unable to do that until this point. So do they have the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=184.08s)]
*  incentive to hold for at least these four days as the exchange continues? You're making a very [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=190.88s)]
*  good point. And for many years, until October 7th, we were actually out of Gaza and we disengaged [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=197.2s)]
*  totally from Gaza. We were thinking that we could convince them to, let's call it how you say it in [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=202.79999999999998s)]
*  English, to play ball through economic incentives and through different kind of rationales that [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=208.4s)]
*  they will understand. But look, we are talking about a radical, vicious, murderous, denocidal [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=213.36s)]
*  agenda, a terrorist organization that is not shy about where they want to go ahead with Israel. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=220.48000000000002s)]
*  They do not care about the innocent civilians in Israel that are butchered. They do not care about [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=227.36s)]
*  what's happening in Gaza. They care about the following things, killing Israelis, killing Jews, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=232.08s)]
*  and full annihilation of the state of Israel. So we are talking with a regime that [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  incentives would not work with them unless it's through understanding of military pressure on them. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=242.56s)]
*  That's the only reason that they are now working in releasing some of the hostages. And you know, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=248.96s)]
*  I want to add one more thing here. Even if we go through the entire mechanism of the four days [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=254.08s)]
*  and the additional incentives of additional days, we are talking about at this point, 20 percent, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=259.2s)]
*  if all 50 hostages will come out, this only 20 percent of the hostages that are still in Gaza [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=265.52s)]
*  and we made it, as I mentioned at the beginning, as our obligation to bring all of them back home. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=272.48s)]
*  And that is a great point. The fathers, brothers, so many other loved ones being [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=278.40000000000003s)]
*  essentially still held by the terrorists, by Hamas. One of the other things that's happening [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=282.48s)]
*  here is a propaganda war. And we don't want there to be a gratitude today to Hamas to reach the deal. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=288.56s)]
*  This never should have happened to begin with. The children never should have been taken. The [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=296.8s)]
*  mothers, the fathers, no one should have been taken. So in the coming days, as we begin to learn [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=300.08s)]
*  what these hostages went through, they may not be able to be completely open about what they [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=306.32s)]
*  experienced. What do you expect propaganda wise during these four days from Hamas? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=312.8s)]
*  We're expecting all of the tricks that they will be able to pull out of their sleeves. They are [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=318.96s)]
*  going to do all the psychological warfare. They're doing it in the lowest moral values [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=323.84s)]
*  elements that they could do. They're attacking the families of the hostages to create a split [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=329.84s)]
*  between them and to have them go after and attack the Israeli government. We know who we're dealing [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=336.08s)]
*  with. These are war criminals. It's not just the atrocities that they committed on October 7th. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=343.59999999999997s)]
*  It's not just, as I mentioned, beheading of children, killing of elderly, Holocaust survivors, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=348.64s)]
*  raping of women. This is the International Day Against Violence Against Women. Nobody is really [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=357.52s)]
*  at the UN paying attention to what was done to our women over there. But these are war criminals, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=363.59999999999997s)]
*  and we don't expect them to do anything rather than continue their efforts. Another point on that [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=368.32s)]
*  is of course the fact that we expect the Red Cross to go to visit our hostages to see that their [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=375.68s)]
*  medical situation, the humanitarian situation of theirs is good, is sound. And until now, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=383.84s)]
*  which is another war crime, apart from the abduction itself, the fact that they're not [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=389.76s)]
*  allowing the Red Cross to meet them is another war crime. So we're dealing with war criminals, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=394.08s)]
*  and I have zero expectations from them. A very important reminder. Never forget October 7th. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=398.64s)]
*  Aviv Ezra, thank you very much for chatting with us this morning. We appreciate it as we're watching [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=404.71999999999997s)]
*  all of this. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N2NJEKV-8&t=409.03999999999996s)]
