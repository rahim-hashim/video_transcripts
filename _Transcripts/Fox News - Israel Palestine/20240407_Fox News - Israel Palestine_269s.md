# Biden is ‘holding’ Israel back in its war with Hamas, expert warns
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4)
*  Here to discuss where the war stands now is George Mason University Scalia Law School [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=0.0s)]
*  professor and director of the Center for Middle East and International Law, Eugene Kantorovich. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=4.36s)]
*  Eugene, thank you so much for being here. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=10.16s)]
*  What should Americans be thinking right now, six months into this war, and what do the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=13.0s)]
*  movements in the Gaza Strip mean right now? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=18.88s)]
*  Who could imagine six months ago when Hamas invaded Israel and murdered, raped, tortured, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=21.28s)]
*  at this point, President Biden would be holding Israel back from defeating Hamas and rescuing [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=29.2s)]
*  the hostages. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=35.28s)]
*  And that is what's happening. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=36.28s)]
*  That's what happened on the call last week with Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=37.56s)]
*  Biden said red light. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=42.08s)]
*  And for a couple months, President Biden has been stopping Israel from taking Hamas's [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=44.64s)]
*  last stronghold. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=49.72s)]
*  It's almost like if the U.S. invaded Germany in World War II and stopped short of Berlin, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=51.04s)]
*  if we invaded Iraq and stopped short of Baghdad, America is not letting President Biden. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=56.08s)]
*  Why is that happening? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=61.56s)]
*  Why is the American president saying stop? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=62.56s)]
*  There's probably two reasons. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=65.16s)]
*  He is concerned about his progressive base, and he wants to make sure that college kids [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=67.2s)]
*  in Madison, Wisconsin turn out in November for the election. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=71.64s)]
*  He wants to make sure the Arab community in Michigan turns out for the election. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=75.52s)]
*  He seems to put that ahead of basic decency and basic morality and is betraying one of [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=80.52s)]
*  our closest allies in its time of greatest need. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=87.8s)]
*  What is the Israeli public thinking of this? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=91.16s)]
*  We see the protests, right? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=93.36s)]
*  Is that about the conduct of the war? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=95.44s)]
*  Is that about Bibi Netanyahu? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=96.92s)]
*  What's the sentiment amongst the Israeli people? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  So the protests, I think, are both about a frustration that the war is not yet won, because [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=100.6s)]
*  I think not everyone understands in Israel that it's because Biden has given a red light [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=106.28s)]
*  and stopped Israel short of success. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=111.0s)]
*  There's also frustration with Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=113.0s)]
*  But most Israelis, I think the overwhelming percentage of Israelis, are committed to fighting [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=115.56s)]
*  this war to the very end until Hamas is completely defeated and Hezbollah is defeated in the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=119.96s)]
*  north. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=124.24s)]
*  But, you know, I think it's good that they're approaching it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=125.24s)]
*  Hezbollah is defeated in the north? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=126.24s)]
*  Is that part of the war? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=127.36s)]
*  Because right now it's... [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=130.0s)]
*  Absolutely, because this is not just a war against Hamas, right? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=131.0s)]
*  On October 7th, it wasn't just Hamas that attacked. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=133.36s)]
*  Hezbollah attacked all Iran's allies and puppets in the area, encircled Israel and attacked [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=136.32000000000002s)]
*  together. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=141.72000000000003s)]
*  Right now, people don't know this. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=142.72000000000003s)]
*  Close to 100,000 people who live in northern Israel are outside of their homes or refugees, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=144.32000000000002s)]
*  internally displaced people. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=149.36s)]
*  Israel's effective territory has shrunk both in the north and the south. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=151.36s)]
*  Israel cannot live with parts of the country uninhabitable due to Hezbollah rocket fire. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=155.96s)]
*  So how... in the south, against Hamas, how quickly can that be wrapped up? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=160.08s)]
*  I think it could be... the minute President Biden says it's okay, I think... [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=165.0s)]
*  Why does the Israeli leadership have to listen to Joe Biden? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=170.60000000000002s)]
*  So I don't think they should necessarily, but his leverage includes things like cutting [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=173.4s)]
*  off weapons supplies. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  Large number of Democratic congressmen, including former speaker Nancy Pelosi, signed a letter [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=181.36s)]
*  President Biden to stop weapons shipments to Israel. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=186.5s)]
*  Now the fact that... [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=190.18s)]
*  I want to get back to the protest for one second because I think it shows something. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=191.18s)]
*  In Israel, it's a democracy. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=193.54s)]
*  Different people can express their opinions. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=195.34s)]
*  What protest aren't we seeing? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=197.5s)]
*  The Palestinian protest against Hamas. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=199.06s)]
*  The Palestinian protest, release the hostages. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=201.34s)]
*  Or the protests of the Arab American community in Israel against Hamas. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=204.22s)]
*  So in Israel, there's two sides to opinion on the war. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=208.94s)]
*  But why are the Palestinians not protesting? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=212.5s)]
*  Why is there nothing on that side saying, release the hostages and the war? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=215.06s)]
*  Well, I think we know. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=219.9s)]
*  And that's why this continues. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=222.9s)]
*  Eugene, exit question. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=224.18s)]
*  Does an open front open up on the north against Hezbollah? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=225.98s)]
*  I mean, you're going to have to go into Lebanon. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=229.42000000000002s)]
*  So right now, Hezbollah is on an almost daily basis shooting missiles into Israel. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=232.86s)]
*  Israel cannot live like that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=238.54s)]
*  And obviously the only way to do that is going to be to enter Lebanon and push Hezbollah [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=239.62s)]
*  north of the Latani River as the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 actually [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=244.34s)]
*  requires and demands. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=249.85999999999999s)]
*  Needless to say, that resolution is not going to enforce itself. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=252.14s)]
*  Israel is going to have to make it happen. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=254.14s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=255.66s)]
*  Eugene, thank you very much for visiting us. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLm2hNYjs4&t=256.65999999999997s)]
