# Hamas was LAUGHING at Biden for doing this: Former ambassador to Israel
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE)
*  Welcome back, America. We have a good friend of mine, David Freeman, former U.S. Ambassador [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=0.0s)]
*  to Israel. Mr. Ambassador, first question is this. You were the most successful ambassador [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=6.0s)]
*  in the history of our country, working with the state of Israel. How often has the Biden [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=13.24s)]
*  administration consulted you or asked you for advice on policy in the Middle East? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  If you add it all up together, Mark, it would be zero. It's, and by the way, it's great [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=24.88s)]
*  to be with you. No, they haven't consulted with me, and I've offered, by the way, and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=29.2s)]
*  I've offered several times, and unfortunately, they haven't taken me up on it. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=33.64s)]
*  Mark, I want to thank you for your earlier comments about President Trump and the things [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=38.68s)]
*  he's done for Israel, because they've been outstanding. And if I can, just give you a [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=43.36s)]
*  little background on that, because, you know, it's not as if, you know, he just sat there [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=47.32s)]
*  signing orders and making declarations. You know, whenever I was back in the Oval Office [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=52.84s)]
*  and it was probably at least once a month, you know, during the first year, we'd sit [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  there and Jared would be with us and Jason and others. And the basic, you know, the basic [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=62.839999999999996s)]
*  goal of the conversation was how do we make our allies stronger and how do we make our [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=69.24s)]
*  enemies weaker? And of course, in my case, the most important ally was Israel. And we [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=74.6s)]
*  would talk about all the things that could be done to make Israel stronger that would [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=79.2s)]
*  turn also help America make America stronger, more safe, more secure. And how do we deal [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=83.16s)]
*  with Israel's enemies, which were primarily at that time and continue to be Iran, overwhelmingly [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=88.24s)]
*  Iran, and then, you know, the Palestinian Authority and Hamas? And, you know, during [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=93.68s)]
*  those discussions, you know, all these incredible things that you mentioned came out, most importantly, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=98.92s)]
*  the sanctions against Iran. We took them to the point of bankruptcy. And now, of course, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=105.0s)]
*  we're a very, very wealthy country. We ended the financing of the Palestinians. We ended [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=109.16s)]
*  the financing of Hamas, of UNRWA, of all those things. And you know what? Duringâ€”as a result [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=113.11999999999999s)]
*  of all those things, everyone said, you know, you're going to create violence, you're [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=118.56s)]
*  going to create wars. There was no slaughter of Jews during those four years. There was [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  no, you know, attacks against Israel that Israel couldn't handle, couldn't manage. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=125.47999999999999s)]
*  There was no push for a two-state solution. And it was all because, you know, it wasn't [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  just, you know, a president sitting there as a rubber stamp, you know, issuing declarations [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=136.35999999999999s)]
*  that were put in front of his desk. It was based upon an activist president who sat with [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=142.04s)]
*  us and said, how do I make Israel stronger? How do I make America stronger? And how do [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=146.28s)]
*  I weaken these vile enemies that threaten Israel? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=151.32s)]
*  Very well put, Mr. Ambassador. But then I ask you this question. So Joe Biden comes [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=154.32s)]
*  in office. He brings these Obama holdovers with him, top to bottom. John McCain made [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=159.64s)]
*  an incredible speech years ago about Blinken when he was up for deputy secretary, and he [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=166.51999999999998s)]
*  said, absolutely not. This guy is completely off the wall. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=171.6s)]
*  But they do represent the Obama ideology. Obama was the most hostile president to the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=175.48s)]
*  state of Israel until now. I think this administration is by far the worst. That's just my opinion. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=179.92s)]
*  They come in. There's peace breaking out all over the Middle East. And rather than [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=186.24s)]
*  take the baton and continue with the Abraham Accords and all the rest of it, they blow [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=189.64000000000001s)]
*  the whole thing up. And they start rearming Iran. And they lift all the waivers on Iran. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=193.64000000000001s)]
*  And they're giving hundreds of millions to the PLO. They're giving millions to UNRWA, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=199.54000000000002s)]
*  which gives millions to Hamas. And they did it without any demands. They did it without [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=203.36s)]
*  any, with any challenges, without any discontent. None of it. What do you make of that? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=208.8s)]
*  Yeah, I think, first of all, they clearly don't understand the Middle East. I mean, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=214.16000000000003s)]
*  they have this ridiculous notion that by throwing money at hostile actors, you gain their respect, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=217.20000000000002s)]
*  you gain their trust. Just the opposite. They were laughing at us. You know, Hamas and the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=222.48000000000002s)]
*  PA were laughing at Biden, saying, this guy has given us money, and we don't have to [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=226.56s)]
*  do anything for it. We don't have to agree to end terrorist activities. We don't have [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=231.32000000000002s)]
*  to disarm. We don't have to stop paying terrorists to kill Jews. We don't have to [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=234.96s)]
*  end the pay-for-slave pension program that the Palestinian Authority, not Hamas, the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=239.83999999999997s)]
*  supposed good guys, the Palestinian Authority, their pension plan that pays terrorists more [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=244.95999999999998s)]
*  money to kill Jews. The more Jews you kill, the more money you get. No accountability. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=249.72s)]
*  And then they made Iran into a very wealthy nation. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=254.16s)]
*  And then on top of that, you know, on top of the, you know, all this insane and malign [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=257.24s)]
*  behavior, they start advertising normalization with Saudi Arabia, as if somehow, you know, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=261.88s)]
*  that's going to make it more likely to happen. Just the opposite. You remember back when [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=268.04s)]
*  we did the Abraham Accords, the first Abraham Accord was announced August 13th of 2020. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=271.76000000000005s)]
*  Before we announced that deal between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, how many people [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=278.0s)]
*  knew about it? Like, six people in the whole world knew about it. And that's how you [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=282.06s)]
*  make deals in this world. You don't start broadcasting it and creating trial balloons. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=285.6s)]
*  But Biden started, you know, he started advertising. So, of course, you know, things went sideways. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  So there's a combination of gross ineptitude and a real failure to understand the Middle [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=294.88s)]
*  East in a way where, you know, we are literally empowering our enemies. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=300.88s)]
*  Look at this number. Right now, they're talking about roughly a $14 billion aid package to [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=304.71999999999997s)]
*  Israel, our most important ally in the Middle East. Well, just in the last month, Biden's [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=310.84s)]
*  given Iran $16 billion, right? First a $6 billion, you know, sanction gift, and then [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=315.64s)]
*  a $10 billion one. So in just a month, they're giving Iran more money than they're giving [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=320.92s)]
*  Israel. I mean, it's just unexplainable. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_YeDNtvZE&t=325.40000000000003s)]
