# New details reveal Israel's intended target in Iranian counterattack
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5l0NUusi3M)
*  But first to Jeff Paul, he's live on the ground in Tel Aviv. Jeff, any word from Israel's war cabinet on this? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5l0NUusi3M&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, well we are expecting them to meet today if they haven't already obviously the topic of discussion would be the strike on Iran [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5l0NUusi3M&t=9.36s)]
*  But it is important to point out that so far on the record there have been no comments made by anyone within the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5l0NUusi3M&t=16.36s)]
*  Israeli government or within the Israeli military and that really makes sense because when it comes to these very targeted missions [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5l0NUusi3M&t=22.6s)]
*  It's very rare for the Israeli government or the Israeli military to go on the record and talk about them or confirm them [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5l0NUusi3M&t=29.580000000000002s)]
*  But the strike alone does send a message and namely sends the message to Iran that [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5l0NUusi3M&t=36.38s)]
*  Israel can hit within its borders pretty much anytime it wants anywhere [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5l0NUusi3M&t=41.980000000000004s)]
*  It wants now in in terms of the specifics of this targeted strike [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5l0NUusi3M&t=47.1s)]
*  It's roughly 200 miles away from the capital city of Tehran and the region of Isfahan [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5l0NUusi3M&t=52.42s)]
*  And it's also near the Natanz nuclear facility the site wasn't hit but the strike appeared to target a nearby [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5l0NUusi3M&t=57.980000000000004s)]
*  Military base Iranian state media so far has mostly downplayed the strike [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5l0NUusi3M&t=65.38s)]
*  They've reported there were explosions and those explosions were from the Iranian air defense system responding to three drones [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5l0NUusi3M&t=69.98s)]
*  Those are their words [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5l0NUusi3M&t=77.54s)]
*  But made no mention of a source of the attack and Iranian official has also reportedly told Reuters that it has no [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5l0NUusi3M&t=78.42s)]
*  Plans to strike back immediately but listen to what Iran's foreign minister had to say when he was asked about [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5l0NUusi3M&t=85.76s)]
*  Israel during an interview just a few hours before that Israeli strike in Iran [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5l0NUusi3M&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  What will our maximum response to me? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5l0NUusi3M&t=98.64000000000001s)]
*  I can only say that it will be carried out at a maximum level and it will be regretful for them [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5l0NUusi3M&t=101.08000000000001s)]
*  The details have been planned by the armed forces of my country [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5l0NUusi3M&t=107.06s)]
*  Now [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5l0NUusi3M&t=111.86s)]
*  We haven't heard much from [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5l0NUusi3M&t=114.14s)]
*  Israel today a little while ago Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu posted this on social media [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5l0NUusi3M&t=116.22s)]
*  It's kind of hard to see there with the graphics [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5l0NUusi3M&t=122.5s)]
*  Covering up, but that's a picture of Benjamin Netanyahu sitting at his desk right below his hand [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5l0NUusi3M&t=124.9s)]
*  There are some documents right there that are blurred out and he titled it basically with a very cryptic message [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5l0NUusi3M&t=130.02s)]
*  Shabbat shalom now as far as life goes here in Tel Aviv things have really seemed very normal today [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5l0NUusi3M&t=135.85999999999999s)]
*  You see a lot of people out at the beach. You've seen people exercising [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5l0NUusi3M&t=142.33999999999997s)]
*  doing their shopping ahead of [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5l0NUusi3M&t=146.06s)]
*  Shabbat and you know getting ready for the Passover holiday, which starts on Monday Trace [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5l0NUusi3M&t=148.7s)]
*  Jeff Paul live for us in Tel Aviv Jeff will get back to you as the news warrants. Thank you [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5l0NUusi3M&t=153.89999999999998s)]
