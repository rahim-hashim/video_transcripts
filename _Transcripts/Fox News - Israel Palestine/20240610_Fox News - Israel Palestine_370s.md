# CNN torched for shocking mistake on Israeli's hostage rescue
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [June 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw)
*  The New York Times publishing a piece on all the things they say will happen if Donald [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump becomes president once again. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  And here are the main points on their list. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=8.86s)]
*  Crack down on illegal immigration to an extreme degree. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=11.08s)]
*  Use the Justice Department to prosecute his adversaries. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=14.74s)]
*  Increase presidential power. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=18.32s)]
*  Aggressively expand his first term efforts to upend America's trade policies. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=19.72s)]
*  Retreat from military engagement with Europe and use military force in Mexico and on American [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=24.76s)]
*  soil. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  Joe Concha is a Fox News contributor and he joins us now. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  And Joe, we should note that this article was found in the politics not op-ed section. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=34.44s)]
*  Despite the language of it being so over the top bias, it's almost as if the authors of [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=38.96s)]
*  it don't want people to vote for Donald Trump and they're trying to tell them why. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=44.44s)]
*  You think Carly? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=50.32000000000001s)]
*  Todd? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=51.32000000000001s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=52.32000000000001s)]
*  Hope you had a good weekend. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=53.32000000000001s)]
*  If only we had some sort of way to know what a Trump presidency would look like. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=54.44s)]
*  The New York Times is saying, oh my gosh, who is this guy you see on your screen? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=59.52s)]
*  What is he capable of? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=64.16s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=65.36s)]
*  He was president from 2017 to 2021. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=66.36s)]
*  We do know that he will secure the border, especially if the Senate is flipped and Congress [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  stays in GOP hands. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=74.84s)]
*  We do know that his economic policies gave us one of the greatest economies we've seen [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=76.46000000000001s)]
*  in our lifetime. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=80.88s)]
*  That's not an opinion. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=81.88s)]
*  That is a fact. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=83.08s)]
*  And from a foreign policy perspective, again, if you're looking at the precedent, we may [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=84.3s)]
*  not be bogged down in wars that seem to have no end. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=88.52s)]
*  And we've seen multiple fear-mongering so-called news stories from other outlets before. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=92.28s)]
*  To your point, Carly, this is not in the op-ed section. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=96.19999999999999s)]
*  These are news reporters. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=99.46s)]
*  One of the folks on that byline is Maggie Haberman, who has written multiple anti-Trump [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=101.6s)]
*  books and appears on CNN on a daily basis to talk about how horrible Donald Trump is. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=107.76s)]
*  So it's no surprise coming from the New York Times. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=112.92s)]
*  They have not endorsed, I've said this once, I'll say it again, a Republican presidential [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  candidate since Elvis was a thing in the 1950s. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=119.2s)]
*  So this is exactly what you would expect from the so-called paper of record, Todd. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=122.72s)]
*  A little bit surprised that Jonathan Swans on this as well. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=126.52000000000001s)]
*  But I mean, this is the way that the paper's going, so that's the way the paper is going. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=129.6s)]
*  Meantime, CNN under fire for reporting Israeli hostages were released and not rescued by [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=134.64s)]
*  Israeli defense forces. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=140.72s)]
*  Stop antisemitism.org posting this. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=142.67999999999998s)]
*  Come on, CNN. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=144.88s)]
*  The four hostages were rescued, not released. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=145.88s)]
*  Do better. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=147.88s)]
*  And Israeli student Yari Cohen writing hostage release? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=148.88s)]
*  Seriously, CNN, you should be ashamed. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=151.95999999999998s)]
*  What a disgusting headline. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  Joe, is this an honest mistake from, let's say, an intern working the Saturday shift [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  in these almost summer hours, you know, because we were all there, we all worked those shifts, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=160.88s)]
*  or is there something more happening here? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=166.24s)]
*  Well, let's say it was an intern working a Saturday on a nice sunny Saturday in June, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=169.04s)]
*  right? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=175.2s)]
*  And they mixed up released with rescued. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=176.2s)]
*  From there, I would think, and you see the chiron, that's the headline on your screen [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=179.24s)]
*  right now. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=184.62s)]
*  Well, it could have been corrected in all the hours since, on all the Sunday talk shows [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=186.62s)]
*  that CNN had, somebody could have gone on the air and said, obviously, they were rescued, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=190.98000000000002s)]
*  lives were lost in that rescue, and they weren't released by Hamas. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=195.5s)]
*  So CNN very easily can correct this. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=199.88s)]
*  They can still do it today. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=201.98000000000002s)]
*  I have a feeling we're not going to see that correction because this is who this network [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=202.98000000000002s)]
*  is at this point. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=206.32s)]
*  Yeah, it was incredible news that those four hostages were rescued, including that girl [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=207.32s)]
*  who became sort of the face of this horrific October 7th attack. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=212.9s)]
*  And one soldier, like you mentioned, did die during the rescue effort. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=217.22s)]
*  They were absolutely not released. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=221.28s)]
*  So there's also this President Biden, he wrapped up his trip to France with a speech yesterday. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=224.04000000000002s)]
*  He made a mistake confusing Ukraine with Iraq. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=230.68s)]
*  Watch. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=233.62s)]
*  The idea that we become semi-isolations now, which some are talking about, I mean, the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=234.62s)]
*  idea we had to wait all those months just to get the money for Iraq, because we're [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=240.76s)]
*  waiting, I mean, it's just, it's just, it's not who we are. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=245.8s)]
*  It's not who America is. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=250.96s)]
*  America shows up when we need it, just like our allies show for us. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=252.44s)]
*  And the White House transcript, Joe, they fixed the Biden gaff, they crossed out the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=257.64s)]
*  word Iraq in it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=261.42s)]
*  Yeah, they've done this before, Carly, right? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=263.8s)]
*  This is the same president in a Time magazine interview last week that said Russia invaded [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=267.8s)]
*  Russia on two occasions. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=272.12s)]
*  Go back and read that transcript sometime. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=274.42s)]
*  Go back and read the Robert Herr report and that transcript, as far as the president not [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=276.15999999999997s)]
*  remembering when he was vice president, not remembering when his son died. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=281.56s)]
*  And by the way, I take issue with the portrayal in many media reports that I read this morning [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=285.2s)]
*  that says that Trump refused to visit the same American cemetery where Joe Biden was [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=290.34s)]
*  speaking this morning. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=295.74s)]
*  It's about 60 miles north of Paris. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=296.78000000000003s)]
*  Obviously, it honors those who were lost in World War I. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=298.66s)]
*  And this is according to an AP report in 2018. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=303.18s)]
*  The determination to ground Marine One, the president's helicopter, due to bad weather, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=305.6s)]
*  is made by the Marine Corps and the White House military office, which then presents [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=309.46000000000004s)]
*  the recommendation to the White House in collaboration with the Secret Service, according to a Secret [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=313.1s)]
*  Service official. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=317.1s)]
*  So I keep seeing reports that Trump didn't want to go there in 2018. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=318.1s)]
*  He couldn't go there because he was told by his own people that the weather didn't [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=321.58s)]
*  allow it for a helicopter to be flown in those conditions. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=324.86s)]
*  So I just want to get that on the record, by the way. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=327.78s)]
*  But overall, this is who Joe Biden is at this point. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=329.42s)]
*  You take him out of a teleprompter and it's a clean up on aisle five, 17 and 24. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=332.46s)]
*  The debate is everything on June 27th. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=336.58s)]
*  Can he last for 90 minutes without a script, without a teleprompter and defend his record, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=338.65999999999997s)]
*  which has been horrific to this point, if you read every poll as far as inflation, crime, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=343.82s)]
*  the border and other policies such as foreign policy. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=348.14s)]
*  And he's going to be in Italy later this week for the G7. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=351.58s)]
*  So he'll have plenty of opportunities to speak publicly overseas once again there. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=354.5s)]
*  Joe, thank you very much. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=358.14s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUtlFZ5pUnw&t=359.54s)]
