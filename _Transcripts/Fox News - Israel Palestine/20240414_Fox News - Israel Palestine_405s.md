# People better open their eyes right now: Levin
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE)
*  The host of Life, Liberty and Levin. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=0.0s)]
*  Normally he's been on for about two hours ago, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=2.92s)]
*  but we have special coverage tonight. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  Mark, what's it like now? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=7.12s)]
*  What's it like there? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=8.64s)]
*  It's very quiet, Brian. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=11.28s)]
*  People here are not panicking. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=12.68s)]
*  They're very, very strong. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=14.8s)]
*  I think the people here have had enough [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=16.36s)]
*  of being picked off, attacked, raped, butchered. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  But you say game changer, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=23.12s)]
*  and you had two guests who said game changers. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=24.6s)]
*  Anybody told that to Joe Biden? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=26.48s)]
*  They're already leaking to NBC News. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=27.96s)]
*  Within 90 minutes of the last drone that was taken out [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=30.84s)]
*  about how they're worried about the Israelis [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=36.42s)]
*  will be a little too quick to act. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=38.84s)]
*  They may be too aggressive. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=40.92s)]
*  They're upset about what they did in Damascus. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=42.32s)]
*  Already trashing the Israelis. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=45.56s)]
*  We're trying to figure out how to respond. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  And they're not only trying to say [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=51.44s)]
*  how to respond militarily, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=52.52s)]
*  but trying to figure out how to respond [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=53.96s)]
*  within the definitions and the boundaries [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=56.6s)]
*  that this lousy, awful Biden administration [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  is imposing on them. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  So I know Michael Oren, great guy, senior, great guy. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=64.36s)]
*  Israel needs to do this. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=69.0s)]
*  Israel needs to do that. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=70.2s)]
*  But Israel is under attack by the administration. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=72.16s)]
*  Of course we, the American people, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=76.0s)]
*  help Israel with these drones. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=78.8s)]
*  This is who we are. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=80.92s)]
*  This is the position of the United States government. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=81.88s)]
*  It's not Biden's position. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=84.36s)]
*  This has been the position of the United States government [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=85.8s)]
*  for 76 years. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=88.48s)]
*  When Harry Truman first recognized the state of Israel, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=89.89999999999999s)]
*  he's not doing anything special. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=92.36s)]
*  What he's doing that is awful and horrendous [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=94.36s)]
*  is on the one hand, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=97.46s)]
*  look, we've got red blooded, great American hero [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=98.88s)]
*  stationed there, but on the other hand, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=102.4s)]
*  he's attacking the ally right in the middle of a major war [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  and they're leaking to NBC. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=110.75999999999999s)]
*  That is blinking. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=112.4s)]
*  That is these guys at the State Department. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=113.6s)]
*  They do not want Israel to ultimately defeat Iran. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=116.19999999999999s)]
*  Now, Iran needs to be defeated. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=121.41999999999999s)]
*  Hamas needs to be defeated. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=123.6s)]
*  We're not gonna do it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  Israel's prepared to do it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=127.11999999999999s)]
*  And this can't go on this way. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=129.34s)]
*  It's not like there were always nice guys [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=131.4s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=133.2s)]
*  No, quite the contrary. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=134.2s)]
*  It's a whole horrendous scene in the Middle East. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=135.95999999999998s)]
*  But we know how to keep it calm. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=138.64s)]
*  It just happened in the prior administration [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=140.42s)]
*  under Donald Trump. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=142.32s)]
*  The Palestinians don't get to call the shots. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=144.28s)]
*  Iran doesn't get to call the shots. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=146.48s)]
*  They don't get to shoot missiles and missiles and missiles. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=148.68s)]
*  People come here. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=151.6s)]
*  Do people realize this is a civilized nation [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=153.56s)]
*  that every three or four days, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=156.14s)]
*  people are running to the basement? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=157.32s)]
*  We wouldn't put up with that. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=159.52s)]
*  150,000 missiles, people keep saying that the Hezbollah has. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=160.94s)]
*  It got people coming on. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=165.72s)]
*  They say, and not only that, they can target. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=166.92s)]
*  They can target Tel Aviv. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=168.96s)]
*  They can target Jerusalem. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=171.4s)]
*  These are cities with millions of people. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=172.52s)]
*  These are populations. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=174.36s)]
*  Would we sit here if we had a country [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  with 150,000 missiles targeting our cities? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=179.28s)]
*  And as I said a few hours ago, Brian, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=183.44s)]
*  how come they never talk about the fact [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=186.12s)]
*  that Israel has nukes? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=187.8s)]
*  Not that they'll use them. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=189.12s)]
*  How come the media and the experts act like [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=190.8s)]
*  it's not a big deal? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=193.64000000000001s)]
*  What do you think, Brian, might happen [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=194.52s)]
*  if 100,000 targeted missiles hit Tel Aviv and Jerusalem? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=196.92000000000002s)]
*  There's a counter threat out there, too. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=201.88s)]
*  As for me, I am fine. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  I am pissed off. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=206.28s)]
*  These people need to be defeated. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=207.68s)]
*  They can be defeated. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=210.64s)]
*  They're not a 10-foot tall. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=212.12s)]
*  These aren't 10-foot tall soldiers. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=214.04s)]
*  Anyway, go ahead. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=218.12s)]
*  So Mark, we know this. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=218.96s)]
*  Yemen, Syria, Lebanon, all basically controlled by Iran. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=221.88s)]
*  Gaza, controlled by Iran. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=226.32s)]
*  Iraq, too, controlled by Iran. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=228.4s)]
*  We've got 2,500 troops there on an island. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  So this might be the moment where Iran... [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=235.0s)]
*  What happens if Israel takes solution? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=238.56s)]
*  This might be the moment that Israel says, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=239.72s)]
*  we're on a war footing. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=242.2s)]
*  This problem's only gonna get worse. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=243.6s)]
*  Iran's only gonna get more powerful. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=245.79999999999998s)]
*  Lebanon's only gonna get more rockets. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=247.95999999999998s)]
*  If we don't finish up... [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=251.04s)]
*  So this might be the moment where Israel [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=251.92s)]
*  did what they did to Reagan. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=255.04s)]
*  They bombed out that nuclear plant in Iraq. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=256.48s)]
*  They told George Bush, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=259.32s)]
*  I'm gonna bomb out that nuclear program in Syria. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=260.8s)]
*  I mean, is this the time when Netanyahu says, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=263.68s)]
*  this is for our survival? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=265.72s)]
*  I'll do it regardless of what America says? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=267.32s)]
*  No, isn't that amazing? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=271.04s)]
*  So Netanyahu has to sit here and decide, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=272.6s)]
*  who's been smeared for years now by the US press, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=275.48s)]
*  I mean, it's really... [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=278.56s)]
*  He's gotta sit here and decide, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=279.52000000000004s)]
*  do I protect my people and defend my country once and for all, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=281.72s)]
*  or do I listen to the Biden ministrate? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=286.72s)]
*  I'll think about that. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=290.52s)]
*  Do I protect my people and my country, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=292.16s)]
*  or do I have to buckle to the Biden ministrate? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=295.44s)]
*  And I want the people to understand, Brian, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=297.6s)]
*  and you understand it. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=299.56s)]
*  He has to make a decision. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=300.40000000000003s)]
*  He has to be concerned that Biden will slow walk weapons. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=302.76s)]
*  That's what he's done. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=305.72s)]
*  That Biden will send Schumer on the Senate floor [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=307.12s)]
*  to say that this man needs to be deposed, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=309.48s)]
*  all the rest of it. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=311.96000000000004s)]
*  It's so diabolical and it's so outrageous. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=313.96s)]
*  And it goes, other than you and me [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=317.04s)]
*  and a handful of other, it goes unsaid. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=318.8s)]
*  Iran wouldn't have been able to do any of this, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=321.48s)]
*  but to the back, in fact, Biden funded them. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=324.2s)]
*  Biden armed them. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=327.2s)]
*  Biden has gotten more money to Iran [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=328.16s)]
*  than he has to Ukraine. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=329.84s)]
*  The Iranians were in no position to do any of these things. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=333.6s)]
*  So yes, it's a game changer. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=336.52s)]
*  So my question to all the experts is, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=338.0s)]
*  well, what are you banging on Netanyahu for? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=340.32s)]
*  Why don't you talk to Biden and Blinken about this? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=342.52000000000004s)]
*  Not only did they create this situation, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=344.56s)]
*  not only did they rearm the enemy, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=347.0s)]
*  but they keep undermining even 10-9 states. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=349.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm speaking to you with NBC News. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=352.28000000000003s)]
*  Now you and I agree on Ukraine. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=354.72s)]
*  I don't know what these isolations are up to, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=356.40000000000003s)]
*  but I'm gonna just say it right now. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=359.36s)]
*  Russia cuts through Ukraine, Poland better watch out. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=363.32s)]
*  These guys are serious. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=366.68s)]
*  People think that, you know, people say, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=368.36s)]
*  what are we gonna do, get into World War II? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=370.36s)]
*  They better open their damn eyes right now [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=372.24s)]
*  because it's setting up like World War II [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=373.96000000000004s)]
*  and not because we're so tough. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=375.72s)]
*  It's because we are not standing up to these forces. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=377.64s)]
*  Absolutely. You gotta go for total victory. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=381.0s)]
*  Russia's gonna cut right through it. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=383.48s)]
*  Look out for the Baltics. They all know it. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=384.64s)]
*  And it seems you've just sitting by [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=386.84000000000003s)]
*  and some Republicans too. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=388.8s)]
*  I 100% agree. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fgh9VjOoE&t=390.32s)]
