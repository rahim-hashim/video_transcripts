# Biden admin doesn't think Israel can fully win war against Hamas: Report
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [May 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y)
*  Apparently sending Israel more than a billion dollars in tank ammo, tactical vehicles and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=0.0s)]
*  bombs. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  That reverses last week's pause on weapons shipments. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=7.98s)]
*  General Jack Keane, former Vice Chief of Staff for the Army, now CEO of the Institute for [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=11.82s)]
*  the Study of War, Fox News strategic analyst. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=14.96s)]
*  Sir, good morning to you. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=17.28s)]
*  It's great to have you on. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=18.7s)]
*  I don't know which side or which way this is going, but apparently the winds are blowing [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=19.78s)]
*  in the way for Jerusalem. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=23.740000000000002s)]
*  Marco's headline, the Biden administration doesn't think Israel can fully win in Gaza. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=25.94s)]
*  Take a crack at that first against Hamas. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=32.02s)]
*  Yeah, well I think what they're talking about is Israel's ability to destroy the fighting [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=34.980000000000004s)]
*  capability and effectiveness of all the Hamas units. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=42.46s)]
*  And certainly there is some truth to that. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=45.980000000000004s)]
*  That's what this, the pettiness of stopping these 2,000 pound bombs, when Israel has so [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=48.260000000000005s)]
*  much on its plate. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=53.96s)]
*  Just look what they're dealing with. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=55.82s)]
*  Hezbollah is still attacking from the north into Israel and they've displaced 80,000 citizens. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=57.02s)]
*  The Israelis need to go into Ra'a to deal with what leadership is there, put pressure [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=63.620000000000005s)]
*  on the release of the remaining hostages and also destroy as much as they can the Hamas [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=68.98s)]
*  fighting infrastructure that is there. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=74.74000000000001s)]
*  Now they're dealing with northern Gaza, which is the statement that you're referencing here, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=76.94s)]
*  the Israelis once again are doing the second and third clearing of certain neighborhoods [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=83.3s)]
*  to deal with Hamas and at the same time in the last several days, Hamas has attacked [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=88.53999999999999s)]
*  them over 30 times in very small groups attempting to snipe at them, ambush them, much more like [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=93.86s)]
*  a guerrilla unit. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=101.1s)]
*  And it cites the advantage that Hamas has in the use of the tunnels bill where they [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=102.53999999999999s)]
*  can, when the IDF is clearing in a neighborhood, some will stay and fight, others will move [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=108.22s)]
*  away and come back another day. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=114.86s)]
*  And that is what we're seeing the advantage the tunnels have. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=117.78s)]
*  2,000 pound bombs, interesting enough, Bill, were being used by the IDF to destroy those [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=120.94s)]
*  tunnels because they have the lethality and the penetration capability to do that and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=127.22s)]
*  why many of us took issue with the Biden administration. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=133.62s)]
*  So the IDF has their hands full for sure in prosecuting this war. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=137.24s)]
*  It's much more complicated. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=142.68s)]
*  They will admit that the tunnel complexes themselves are considerably more extensive [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=144.46s)]
*  than anything they had imagined them to be and they certainly are providing refuge for [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=150.98000000000002s)]
*  the Hamas fighters and the ability for them to move from one area to another to interdict [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=156.44s)]
*  the Israelis as they're conducting their military operations. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=162.18s)]
*  So why vacillate? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=165.66s)]
*  Why were these headlines coming out of the White House about the delay in a single, talking [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=169.06s)]
*  of a billion dollars, but withholding one single shipment of 2,000 pound bombs? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=173.26s)]
*  And apparently you're going to make the dumb bombs smart bombs when you attach them to [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=180.57999999999998s)]
*  GPS guidance systems. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=185.34s)]
*  They made a point of telling America that that was happening. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=189.34s)]
*  Perhaps that's more of a political question than a military question, but take a crack [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=192.66s)]
*  at it. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=196.4s)]
*  Well, I think what really happened is they, we know for weeks they were trying to stop [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=197.4s)]
*  the Israelis from going into Ra'aqa. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=202.5s)]
*  Obviously millions of people had moved there were seeking temporary refuge, but all along [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=204.94s)]
*  the IDF said that they were going to move the people. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=210.34s)]
*  The hundreds of thousands of them have left because the Israelis have told them they're [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=213.54s)]
*  moving in and they've actually told them where they're going. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=218.78s)]
*  But I think the administration got so frustrated with the Israelis refusing to stop the operation [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=222.82s)]
*  in Ra'aqa that they made a decision, okay, we're going to take away some of their weapon [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=229.34s)]
*  systems and show them how serious we are. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=233.54s)]
*  I thought that was indeed petty on their part to do something like that. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=235.94s)]
*  If you want to be a cynic. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=241.46s)]
*  And then of course it became public, it backfired on them. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=242.46s)]
*  If you want to be a cynic, you can say the school's out and the universities, many of [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=245.42s)]
*  them are done now. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByv3K4xx2Y&t=250.1s)]
