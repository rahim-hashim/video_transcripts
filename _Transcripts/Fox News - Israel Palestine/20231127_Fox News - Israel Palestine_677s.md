# John Kirby: Israel needs to defend itself against this 'truly genocidal threat'
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI)
*  The lists are developed by Hamas and then of course there's the Israelis [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=0.0s)]
*  developed their list of Palestinian prisoners that they're going to release [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=6.72s)]
*  and we're not involved in the specific drafting of the lists and the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  determination on Hamas's side of who's going to come out on any given day. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=12.24s)]
*  So no Americans today among the 11 hostages that are currently in the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=16.4s)]
*  process of being freed at this hour and everyone rejoices for their release as [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=21.48s)]
*  we wait for these Americans to come home as well. The White House estimates that [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=27.2s)]
*  eight to nine US citizens are still being held by Hamas. So with that we [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=31.6s)]
*  bring in NSC coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby. John welcome [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=37.2s)]
*  good to have you with us today. Thanks. So given the fact that we have eight to [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  nine Americans why are we not involved in the list making? We are actively [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  involved in this deal and in keeping it going we were glad to see that it got [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=52.72s)]
*  extended for an extra couple of days. That's 20 more hostages that will get [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=57.24s)]
*  released over the next 48 hours. That's a good thing but the parameters the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=61.2s)]
*  modalities of who's on the list every day as I said at the briefing today is [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=65.84s)]
*  something that's drawn up by Hamas and by our Israeli counterparts. We will keep [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=69.68s)]
*  working very very hard to make sure that the Americans that we know are being [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=74.76s)]
*  held hostage get home to their families where they belong. This is something [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=78.76s)]
*  that's right on the top of the president's list and he's working this [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=81.4s)]
*  literally by the hour. Well we know that the president Biden spoke with [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  the prime minister of Qatar. I would have imagined that in that conversation he's [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=88.04s)]
*  saying to him I want those Americans out in this group. We want them [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  out now. That's the priority make sure they're on the list. He has absolutely [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=98.0s)]
*  made it clear to the Amir of Qatar and obviously the Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=102.2s)]
*  how strongly we want to see the American hostages get released. Now it's [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=106.28s)]
*  important to remember Martha that the only kinds of hostages that Hamas is [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=110.96s)]
*  willing to let go right now are women and children. We think the majority of [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=114.91999999999999s)]
*  Americans that are being held hostage are male so the chances of them getting [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=118.96s)]
*  out soon are not as good as the chances of getting out. We know that [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=123.19999999999999s)]
*  there are two American women that are that are still left to be released. We [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=127.28s)]
*  don't have perfect visibility on them and their condition but we're we're [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=132.04s)]
*  working very very hard to see if we can get them returned. So let me ask you this. You know when these [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=135.95999999999998s)]
*  extended 48-hour period is agreed to is there any discussion in that of what we [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=139.2s)]
*  want to see pictures? We want to know for example is is Hirsch Polen Goldberg [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=144.72s)]
*  alive? We've spoken to his parents here. We've seen the horrific video of him. He [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=149.28s)]
*  lost half of his arm. So what are you saying to those to those families about [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=153.83999999999997s)]
*  what how much of a priority they are because they are American citizens? Yeah [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=159.44s)]
*  no we've been in touch with the families of course and making it clear that we're [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=163.16s)]
*  trying to do the best we can to get information about their loved ones short [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=167.04s)]
*  of actual release. It's just difficult to do when obviously we don't have direct [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=170.76s)]
*  communications with Hamas but yes look we we obviously want as much information [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=175.2s)]
*  as granular as we can get on all of them. We understand the the extreme curiosity [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=179.39999999999998s)]
*  by their families. We share that. We want to make sure that we can get eyes on them [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=185.6s)]
*  and know that they're okay. So you know in terms of efforts to rescue these [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=189.2s)]
*  American individuals is that something that's off the table right now during [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=194.4s)]
*  this ceasefire and methodical release period that's going on? I would just tell [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=198.12s)]
*  you that right right now this process is working. Now we've gotten almost 60 [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=203.28s)]
*  hostages with today's release out. That's that's pretty impressive over the course [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=207.4s)]
*  of four days. We want to keep that going. We're very excited and the president was [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=212.72s)]
*  personally involved in getting this extension so 20 more hostages over the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=216.84s)]
*  next two days. This process is working so we're gonna keep putting our energies [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=220.72s)]
*  and efforts into that right now. But John was there any promise you know when the president spoke to the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=224.92s)]
*  prime minister and cutter was there any promise that in this next 48 hour period [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=228.6s)]
*  we're gonna see these eight to nine Americans? I'm not gonna get into [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=232.68s)]
*  diplomatic conversations Martha. I would just tell you that we've made it plain [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=235.68s)]
*  and clear that we want to see our American hostages home with their [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=238.88s)]
*  families. We're glad that this thing got extended for a couple of days and we'll [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=241.96s)]
*  just keep watching it as closely as we can. Let me ask you about this John. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=245.76s)]
*  Washington Post headline White House grapples with internal divisions on [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=249.0s)]
*  Israel Gaza and it goes on to say the Hamas attacks and Israeli reactions [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=253.64s)]
*  have roiled the Biden team like no other issue during his presidency. The Biden [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=258.48s)]
*  administration has become identified with a military campaign that has killed [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=264.24s)]
*  more than 13,000 Palestinians, displaced hundreds of thousands of others, created [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=267.16s)]
*  a humanitarian disaster and damaged America's moral authority in much of the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=271.72s)]
*  world. Can you tell me anything about that inner roiling and division that's [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=276.52s)]
*  going on? We understand that there were a group who wanted to speak to Jake [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=281.28s)]
*  Sullivan and Josh Beiner and Anita Dunn to express their concern about the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=286.44s)]
*  president's Israel stance. Look the president understands that there's [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=291.59999999999997s)]
*  strong feelings all across the board here on this conflict between Israel and [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=295.24s)]
*  Hamas and he respects that and we have listened to staff members here at the [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=299.52s)]
*  National Security Council and across administration from all different [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=305.44s)]
*  communities from the Jewish community, from the Muslim community, Palestinian, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=308.52s)]
*  Arab community. We're listening to everybody because they all have a view [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=311.76s)]
*  and we respect that and want to hear their thoughts. The president continues [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=315.24s)]
*  to work this issue very very hard and from the president's perspective and you [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=319.92s)]
*  heard him talk about this a little bit yesterday what we've been doing has been [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=324.04s)]
*  having results. Israel needs to be able to defend itself against a truly [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=327.24s)]
*  genocidal threat that Hamas poses and so we're going to continue to give them the [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=331.8s)]
*  tools and the capabilities to go after that threat as well as lessons learned [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=336.03999999999996s)]
*  from our own experience in urban warfare against terrorists. We're also working [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=339.64s)]
*  but wait wait wait Martha we're also working very very hard as we've been [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=343.59999999999997s)]
*  talking about for the last few minutes to get hostages out to get Americans out [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=346.71999999999997s)]
*  some 850 Americans have been able to leave thanks to our leadership across the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=350.08s)]
*  ruffa crossing and then getting that humanitarian assistance in so we are [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=354.03999999999996s)]
*  producing results and we are urging the Israelis very very stridently to be as [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=357.8s)]
*  careful and discriminated as they can in their targeting to minimize civilian casualties. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=362.92s)]
*  Is the White House okay with a plan after the next couple of days for Israel to go [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=367.24s)]
*  back to its bombing campaign to eradicate Hamas? Is the White House on [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=372.12s)]
*  board with that? Prime Minister Netanyahu's made clear that that they will [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=376.72s)]
*  resume at the appropriate time military operations against Hamas. We believe with [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=380.56s)]
*  them that Hamas still poses a genocidal existential threat to Israel and they [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=384.84s)]
*  have every right and responsibility to keep going after that Hamas leadership so [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=389.28s)]
*  they'll keep getting our support on that. Now what we've also said Martha is you [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=393.52s)]
*  know they've talked about maybe going into the south, South Gaza now next and [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=396.88s)]
*  what we've said is that we don't support them doing that unless or until they [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=400.23999999999995s)]
*  have come up with a very good plan for how they're going to minimize civilian [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=404.23999999999995s)]
*  casualties. They just asked a million or so people to move south into South Gaza [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=408.2s)]
*  so now they're in South Gaza if there's going to be a military operation we want [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=413.76000000000005s)]
*  to make sure that they've accounted for all that civilian life. Let me put it [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=417.08000000000004s)]
*  this way if they do that and they go against White House wishes is it on the [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=420.96000000000004s)]
*  table to say well we're gonna cut off the funding for Israel if you don't abide [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=425.44s)]
*  by the restrictions that we think are you know are the right course of event [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=431.56s)]
*  course of the path to follow here. I'm not going to get into hypotheticals like [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=438.52000000000004s)]
*  that we've been very clear with the Israelis they're going to continue to [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=442.64s)]
*  have our support as they go after this very real threat and they're going to [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=445.08s)]
*  also we're going to continue to give them the benefit of our own perspective [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=448.32s)]
*  and experience in urban warfare and trying to minimize civilian casualties [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=451.24s)]
*  that's going to continue as well. So no red lines for the White House on what [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=454.84s)]
*  Israel does or doesn't do militarily? I'm gonna well I think I'll leave it the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=458.15999999999997s)]
*  way I just did we're going to continue to support them in their efforts and [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=461.76s)]
*  we're going to continue to urge them to be just as discriminant and cautious and [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=464.36s)]
*  careful as possible. Okay I'm gonna ask you about this before I let you go. 74 [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=467.28s)]
*  attacks now another one just today you saw the attack that fell just a couple [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=471.7s)]
*  miles short of the USS Mason it's quite clear that Iran sympathetic proxies [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=476.7s)]
*  whatever you want to call it are escalating these attacks against [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=484.02s)]
*  American and Israeli interests in the region so what is our response to that [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=488.78s)]
*  and you know what we've done so far has not worked because it's getting more [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=495.5s)]
*  intense by the day John. A couple of thoughts on this Martha if you'll [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=501.06s)]
*  indulge me first of all the we're not sure whether it was more than one [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=504.9s)]
*  missile fired by the Houthis regardless it fell they fell some 10 miles away [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=509.41999999999996s)]
*  from the Mason so it wasn't exactly close to Mason in fact it's not exactly [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=515.74s)]
*  clear to us Martha that the Mason was even the target of those missile [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=519.98s)]
*  launches it could have been the civilian merchant vessel that the Mason was [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=523.5s)]
*  helping at some distance away from her at that point that was the target [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=526.82s)]
*  nevertheless and I know the bigger point of your question is it you know these [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=530.74s)]
*  these continued attacks on our facilities in Iraq and Syria we're not [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=534.22s)]
*  going to telegraph our punches we've sent a strong message through the through [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=538.34s)]
*  retaliatory retaliatory strikes of our own that we're gonna do what we have to [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=541.94s)]
*  do to protect our troops in Iraq and Syria and in the region we've added to [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=545.7s)]
*  the force posture the Mason is part of the Eisenhower strike group that the [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=548.82s)]
*  president ordered into the region and we've added air and defense capabilities [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=553.0600000000001s)]

*  nation-state like Iran or a terrorist group or group like the Houthis that [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=563.4000000000001s)]
*  that will do what we have to do to protect ourselves you know I mean what [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=567.9200000000001s)]

*  as has been done by the Trump administration and the Reagan [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=579.32s)]
*  Yeah I'm certainly not gonna telegraph punches Martha I'm not gonna get ahead [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=583.36s)]
*  of decisions that have been made yet we've got the force structure in the [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=587.4s)]
*  region we've added to that force structure we have the ability to protect [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=590.36s)]
*  ourselves and our national interests and those of our partners and we'll do that [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7zHYcliwI&t=593.6s)]
