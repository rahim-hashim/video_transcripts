# No American hostages in first group released by Hamas
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0)
*  The Biden administration is closely monitoring today's first release of Hamas hostages. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=0.0s)]
*  No American hostages have been freed, but a U.S. official telling Fox News that the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  White House is, quote, doing all we can to bring them home. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  Lucas Tomlinson is live in Nantucket, Massachusetts, where the president is spending Thanksgiving. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=15.96s)]
*  Lucas. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  Well, just a few moments ago, we spotted the presidential motorcade rolling through town. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  We were not able to get to see if President Biden was in one of those vans, but there's [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=27.7s)]
*  a good chance he is. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=32.54s)]
*  Just this time a year ago, this is what he did. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=33.54s)]
*  He came into town. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=36.22s)]
*  He did some shopping. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=37.22s)]
*  He also, of course, attended the tree-letting ceremony. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=38.22s)]
*  But, of course, this year, much different with the release of these 24 hostages from [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=41.42s)]
*  Gaza, the 13 Israelis, 10 Thai farm workers who are working in the kibbutz and also the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=46.019999999999996s)]
*  Filipino citizen as well. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=51.42s)]
*  The White House is certainly wanting to see Americans being released in this first tranche [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=54.1s)]
*  of 50 hostages that could ultimately come out during this four-day truce. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=58.7s)]
*  And that, of course, includes that three-year-old little American girl, Abigail Adan, whose [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=63.42s)]
*  parents were killed right in front of her. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=69.66s)]
*  And she spent 16 hours waiting for them before she was ultimately kidnapped and taken into [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=71.9s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=78.22s)]
*  One can only imagine the trauma that little girl has experienced over these past seven [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=79.22s)]
*  weeks and also being reintegrated into Israeli society and growing up to learn that she doesn't [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=82.98s)]
*  have any parents. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=89.7s)]
*  Just horrific stuff. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=90.7s)]
*  The White House is monitoring all these developments with the hostages, certainly the release of [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=91.94s)]
*  American hostages at the top of their list right now. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=96.78s)]
*  We could be hearing from President Biden. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=99.66s)]
*  We just don't have any guidance from White House officials yet. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=101.86s)]
*  We were told to stand by, so we very well could be hearing from President Biden later [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=104.82s)]
*  today. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=108.46s)]
*  Lucas, quick question for you here. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=109.97999999999999s)]
*  There was a piece in The Wall Street Journal today that took us behind the scenes of these [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=112.14s)]
*  negotiations and apparently there was quite a bit of urgency. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=116.05999999999999s)]
*  President Biden got involved directly with the emir of Qatar and President Biden said [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=119.72s)]
*  this could be our last chance. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=123.66s)]
*  And that was according to people with knowledge of the call. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=126.28s)]
*  So it seems the White House had their hand in this, understood how urgent this was. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=128.79999999999998s)]
*  And then here we are today with these 13 hostages. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=133.82s)]
*  President Biden has been working not just with the Israelis but with the emir of Qatar, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=139.38s)]
*  also the president of Egypt in these negotiations. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=143.26s)]
*  Of course, the leaders of Hamas live very openly in Qatar and the government of Qatar [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=147.26s)]
*  has been the mediator in all these hostages and negotiations. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=153.42s)]
*  So the White House has been putting a lot of pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=156.54s)]
*  Netanyahu to not just help secure the release of these hostages but also to agree to the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=160.82s)]
*  four-day truce. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=165.77999999999997s)]
*  It did take some prodding, we are told, to get the Israelis to agree to this truce. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=167.42s)]
*  And now we're seeing hundreds of Palestinians moving from southern Gaza back into northern [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=171.57999999999998s)]
*  Gaza, which could be very difficult for Israeli forces moving forward when it comes to targeting [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=177.77999999999997s)]
*  other senior Hamas leaders. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=183.14s)]
*  Of course, if there's many civilians running around the battlefield, that will make the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=184.7s)]
*  targeting much more difficult. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=188.89999999999998s)]
*  But certainly that's what Hamas wants, is a military disadvantage for the Israeli forces. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=190.61999999999998s)]
*  Lucas, the president was asked, it was either directly about Abigail Adan, the young girl [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=196.02s)]
*  who's celebrating her fourth birthday, or about American hostages generally. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=200.3s)]
*  His last comment we have is from yesterday, so he's seeming to remain hopeful. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=204.57999999999998s)]
*  What can you tell us about the status there? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=209.62s)]
*  That's right, Kayleigh. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=213.26s)]
*  That happened yesterday while the president and first lady were visiting a firehouse here [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=214.26s)]
*  in Nantucket. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=217.94s)]
*  The president was asked by reporters about the hostage deal, the release of these dozens [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=219.22s)]
*  of hostages. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=223.96s)]
*  The president crossed his fingers, held him up to the camera, said he's hopeful. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=224.96s)]
*  But certainly the White House wants to see American hostages released. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=229.0s)]
*  And the expectation was three American hostages were going to be released as part of this [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=232.52s)]
*  initial tranche of 50 hostages being released over the next four days. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=237.96s)]
*  And certainly many Americans want to see that little three-year-old girl, Abigail Adan, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=242.72s)]
*  included in that hostage release. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=247.20000000000002s)]
*  Hey, everyone. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYQCaBKwfz0&t=249.44s)]
