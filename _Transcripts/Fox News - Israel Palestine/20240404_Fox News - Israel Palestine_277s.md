# Netanyahu is sending a 'firm message' to Biden's White House: Sandra Smith
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg)
*  All right, we're going to continue to monitor Secretary Blinken as he continues to speak [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=0.0s)]
*  alive there from Brussels. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=3.88s)]
*  As the White House has released the transcript of that call from Benjamin Netanyahu, the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=6.26s)]
*  readout does say that Biden may clear the need for Israel to announce and implement [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=10.8s)]
*  a series of specific concrete and measurable steps to address the civilian harm, humanitarian [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=14.96s)]
*  suffering and the safety of aid workers there. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=20.44s)]
*  Much more coming from that call. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=23.86s)]
*  We'll have that for you. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=24.96s)]
*  Now we're going to bring in Congressman Mike Waltz, serves on the House Armed Services, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=26.56s)]
*  Foreign Affairs and Intel committees. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=30.439999999999998s)]
*  Sir, thank you very much for joining us. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=32.32s)]
*  We're digging through some of what we are learning was discussed on this call, including [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=34.08s)]
*  what we just heard from Secretary Blinken. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=38.2s)]
*  Biden also emphasized to Netanyahu that the strikes on humanitarian aid workers and the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=40.6s)]
*  overall humanitarian situation are unacceptable. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=45.04s)]
*  Your reaction to what you have heard so far. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=48.92s)]
*  Thanks Sandra. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=53.84s)]
*  I would first remind everyone that under President Biden, we had a civilian aid workers strike [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=54.84s)]
*  during the disgraceful withdrawal from Afghanistan that killed seven children and three humanitarian [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=63.440000000000005s)]
*  workers. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=70.04s)]
*  It was an awful mistake that our service members made. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=71.04s)]
*  And clearly this was a terrible mistake on the part of the IDF. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=76.22s)]
*  But let's save a bit of the public righteous indignation when it comes to our ally clearly [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=80.12s)]
*  making a mistake. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=87.06s)]
*  That is very different than what Hamas has historically done with deliberately target, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=88.06s)]
*  kill and torture civilians, number one. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=93.76s)]
*  And number two, you know, it's just sad to me that I think for purely political reasons, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=95.72s)]
*  so much of the ire of this White House is going on to the shoulders of the Israelis [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=102.66s)]
*  that I think are doing everything they can to avoid civilian casualties, fighting an [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  enemy that is deliberately sacrificing its people in order to turn world opinion against [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=111.64s)]
*  Israel and to watch this administration publicly play right into their hands is incredibly [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=119.28s)]
*  frustrating. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=125.96s)]
*  And finally, Sandra, if we're talking about alleviating the suffering, then let's talk [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=126.96s)]
*  about things outside of just putting pressure on Israel. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=132.48s)]
*  How about Egypt allowing people to come across the Rafah border crossing and establish refugee [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=136.95999999999998s)]
*  camps there? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  How about we gather the international Muslim community to actually help the Palestinians [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=146.42s)]
*  alleviate that suffering and to reform the Palestinian authority so that they can once [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  again provide their own security on the day after the war. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=159.33999999999997s)]
*  But we're not hearing any discussion of that. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=162.64s)]
*  We're only seeing the rhetorical pounding of Netanyahu and his government. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=164.96s)]
*  And again, I think it's for purely election year politics when it comes to seeing Arab [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=169.88s)]
*  Americans walk away from this president. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=175.0s)]
*  Well, speaking of which, more from this call as we know that it did conclude and it lasted [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=178.79999999999998s)]
*  about 30 minutes, we're told. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=182.88s)]
*  As for what Netanyahu told President Biden, he said Israel can defend itself and we will [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=185.4s)]
*  act according to principle that we will hurt anyone that hurts us. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=191.32s)]
*  He went on to tell Biden that Iran has been working against Israel for years and therefore [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=196.95999999999998s)]
*  Israel is operating against Iran and its proxies. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=202.72s)]
*  Obviously, Netanyahu is sending a very firm message over the call to the White House. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=206.6s)]
*  Well, this has everything to do with the strike Israel just took on the Iranian consulate [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=213.92s)]
*  in Syria and took out the Iranian Quds Force officers, which I think was the exact right [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=218.4s)]
*  thing to do because at the end of the day, the true disease here, underscoring Hezbollah, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=224.16000000000003s)]
*  Hamas, the Houthis, all of it, the militias that killed our service members in Iraq, is [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=229.84s)]
*  Iran. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=236.60000000000002s)]
*  And the best way we could help Israel and help end this war is dry up the cash in Iran [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=237.60000000000002s)]
*  that is fueling all of their terrorist proxies. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=243.10000000000002s)]
*  And yet, we have a bill in the House that would put secondary sanctions on the Chinese [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=247.16s)]
*  buyers of Iranian oils. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=252.0s)]
*  We can't get that through the Senate and that's what Biden should be talking about right now. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=254.6s)]
*  Dry up the cash. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=259.24s)]
*  Good to get your reaction. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=260.24s)]
*  As Blinken continues to talk, we'll continue monitoring that. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=261.24s)]
*  Congressman, thanks for joining us. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=264.12s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XNTSsdkMg&t=265.36s)]
