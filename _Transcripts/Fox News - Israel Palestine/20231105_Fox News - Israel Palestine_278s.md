# This is one of the ‘biggest threats’ to America, Chaffetz warns
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64)
*  Well, the numbers are shocking. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=0.0s)]
*  Interest on the federal debt is totaling $659 billion for the fiscal year of 2023. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=2.88s)]
*  And that's up more than $180 billion just from the previous year, and it's the fastest-growing [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=8.84s)]
*  part of the budget. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=15.46s)]
*  The interest alone is now the fourth-largest line item in the federal budget behind only [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=17.06s)]
*  Social Security, Medicare and Defense. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=22.0s)]
*  And it shows no signs of slowing down. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=25.1s)]
*  The Treasury now on track to borrow $1.6 trillion in just the first half of fiscal year 2024, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=27.78s)]
*  almost as much in six months as it did the entire previous year. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=33.7s)]
*  Here with what this means for you and your WalletFox News contributor and former House [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=38.58s)]
*  Oversight Committee Chair Jason Chaffetz. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=42.34s)]
*  He's a friend of the show, and we're glad to have him on this particular topic. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=44.620000000000005s)]
*  You know, it's really hard. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=48.46s)]
*  Jason, we were talking with my producers last night about this segment. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=49.46s)]
*  And it's hard for people to really grasp what these numbers are. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=54.22s)]
*  Here's one way of looking at it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=58.379999999999995s)]
*  Every single day, we pay $2 billion in interest on the debt. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=60.12s)]
*  That's just the interest on the debt. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=64.9s)]
*  $2 billion every single day. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=67.38s)]
*  Yeah, we were balancing budgets back in the 1990s, but now with $33 trillion in debt, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=69.58s)]
*  if you spent $1 million a day every day, it would take you almost 3,000 years to get to [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=77.12s)]
*  $1 trillion. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=84.5s)]
*  So almost 99,000 years just to get to $33 trillion. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=85.5s)]
*  That's how big this thing is. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=90.26s)]
*  We are drowning in debt, and it affects all of us because now the federal government is [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=91.74s)]
*  spending close to, between one out of every five to one out of every four dollars going [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=96.66s)]
*  out the door is spent by the federal government. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=103.26s)]
*  The Federal Reserve is trying to slow the money supply to tackle inflation, but the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=106.22000000000001s)]
*  federal government is spending as fast as it can. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=115.02000000000001s)]
*  It's trying to increase the federal supply of money. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=117.42s)]
*  That's why we have inflation. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=120.9s)]
*  It's so high. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=122.30000000000001s)]
*  So you see that on the screen right there. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=123.30000000000001s)]
*  That's $100,000 per citizen. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=125.38000000000001s)]
*  That's me, Sean, and every single one of our kids owes our portion of the debt is $100,000. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=130.06s)]
*  Let me just, another contrast. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=136.74s)]
*  Israel, who we're giving money to, and we can all talk about the virtue of the cause, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=139.18s)]
*  but let's just talk about the money part of it, right? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=143.78s)]
*  Their citizen per citizen debt is $16,000 versus $100,000, and we're giving money all [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=146.98000000000002s)]
*  over, not just to Israel, to all kinds of other countries, many of them who have lower [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=152.98000000000002s)]
*  debt loads than us. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=156.98000000000002s)]
*  I'm afraid, what can happen here? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=158.66s)]
*  I mean, you're talking about numbers that we can't even fathom in our head. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=160.38s)]
*  You know, there could be some event. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=163.78s)]
*  It could be a war. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=165.45999999999998s)]
*  It could be an oil shock of some sort. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=166.45999999999998s)]
*  What can happen, and how quickly can something happen because of this debt load that we have [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=169.33999999999997s)]
*  right now? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=173.73999999999998s)]
*  Well, I think our national debt is a national security issue. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=174.73999999999998s)]
*  It's perhaps one of the biggest threats to America. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=178.7s)]
*  We used to sell a lot of our debt to China. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=181.98s)]
*  Now, China is now selling about $50 billion worth of our debt, the notes that they already [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=184.70000000000002s)]
*  have. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=189.3s)]
*  They're selling that, and so that puts more and more burden on the system. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=190.3s)]
*  So you're going to really almost double the amount of debt that we issue as a nation. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=193.86s)]
*  Somebody's got to go out there and sell it and get it sold, and the way they do that [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=199.02s)]
*  is they raise interest rates in order to make it more lucrative. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=203.34s)]
*  So there's a real effect here. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=206.78s)]
*  Look, we won't fix this unless Congress stops spending the money. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=209.1s)]
*  Right, but what is the incentive to do that? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=213.82000000000002s)]
*  What's the incentive to do that? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=216.14000000000001s)]
*  I mean, we're waiting for somebody. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=217.14000000000001s)]
*  Republicans aren't even doing that very well. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=218.70000000000002s)]
*  So what is it going to be? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=221.02s)]
*  A shock? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=222.18s)]
*  Is it going to be an economic shock? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=223.18s)]
*  What will get Congress to finally cut? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=224.5s)]
*  I think there will be a day of reckoning, and I hope not, but I think that's what it's [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=229.3s)]
*  probably going to take. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=233.54000000000002s)]
*  I'd like to see a balanced budget amendment. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=234.54000000000002s)]
*  I think we should ask the states, do you want the feds to actually balance the budget? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=236.66000000000003s)]
*  Part of the problem, Rachel, is that almost 75% of the budget is mandatory programmatic [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=241.38s)]
*  spending, and it's just on autopilot. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=247.5s)]
*  Congress only touches less than 10% of that discretionary spending every year when you [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=250.66s)]
*  exclude out the military. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=255.29999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't look like we have a solution in sight, but it's good to at least acknowledge [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=256.9s)]
*  the problem. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=262.09999999999997s)]
*  Jason Chaffetz, thanks for joining us this morning. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=263.09999999999997s)]
*  Scary stuff. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=265.18s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=266.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=267.18s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=268.18s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomMc5C-D64&t=269.18s)]
