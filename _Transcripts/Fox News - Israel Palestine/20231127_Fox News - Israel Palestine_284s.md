*  Even his mother didn't know that because they didn't know what's going on in Israel on those [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5hiPHVGWOs&t=84.96s)]

*  And that's it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5hiPHVGWOs&t=95.8s)]
*  He got a lot of presents on Saturday. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5hiPHVGWOs&t=96.8s)]

*  They told him to pick one or two friends, so he said, I can't pick only one or two. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5hiPHVGWOs&t=103.24s)]
*  I want the old bench. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5hiPHVGWOs&t=108.6s)]
*  So they came like, I think, eight kids, lovely kids. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5hiPHVGWOs&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  I hope that his— [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5hiPHVGWOs&t=115.52s)]
*  They ate ice cream together. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5hiPHVGWOs&t=116.52s)]
*  He's a kid, and he needs to get back to normal life. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5hiPHVGWOs&t=117.52s)]
*  But for Ohad, Ohad has his house and his room and his toys and his friends are waiting for [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5hiPHVGWOs&t=122.56s)]
*  him. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5hiPHVGWOs&t=134.04s)]
*  And the children that were released yesterday and on Saturday, they are kids from the kibbutz, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5hiPHVGWOs&t=135.48s)]
*  which they don't have a place to go to. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5hiPHVGWOs&t=142.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5hiPHVGWOs&t=145.92s)]
*  Well, normal life for him starts with that hug that we're seeing on our screen right [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5hiPHVGWOs&t=146.92s)]
*  now. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5hiPHVGWOs&t=152.48s)]
*  Did he say anything to you, Mirav, about how he was treated, where he was being held, what [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5hiPHVGWOs&t=153.48s)]
*  the last 50 days for him was like? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5hiPHVGWOs&t=159.2s)]
*  It wasn't the last 50 days for a kid, being all the time in the same place with his mom [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5hiPHVGWOs&t=164.0s)]
*  and his grandma and no kids around, no telephone, no video games, no toys. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5hiPHVGWOs&t=171.72s)]
*  His mother is a teacher of kids with special needs, so she knows a lot of—she has a lot [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5hiPHVGWOs&t=184.0s)]
*  of patience and she knows how to play with the kids and how to—so she did a good job. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5hiPHVGWOs&t=191.24s)]
*  They played a lot. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5hiPHVGWOs&t=199.60000000000002s)]
*  He could write. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5hiPHVGWOs&t=202.16s)]
*  He wrote and he drew, but they didn't let them to take the diary and the drawing back [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5hiPHVGWOs&t=203.16s)]

*  So I asked my cousin at the beginning, how did she know what date it is? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5hiPHVGWOs&t=232.44s)]
*  So she said that she got a pen and a notebook and she knew every day that passed. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5hiPHVGWOs&t=238.04s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5hiPHVGWOs&t=246.44s)]

*  So she knew when his birthday was, and it's unbelievable that he celebrated his birthday [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5hiPHVGWOs&t=249.0s)]
*  in captivity. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5hiPHVGWOs&t=253.07999999999998s)]
