# Mike Pompeo: Biden's weakness invited Iran to unleash Hamas
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ)
*  As we stay with our top story, the ground war in Gaza has begun. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=0.0s)]
*  And this brings us to a very, very important question, whether or not Israel is forced [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=3.68s)]
*  to open a two-front war. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=8.48s)]
*  What role should the U.S. play? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=10.64s)]
*  How do we protect our American soldiers in the region and deter any threat from Iran [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=12.68s)]
*  without sparking a world war or an entire breakout of war in the entire region? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=18.2s)]
*  Joining us once again is former Secretary of State, our friend Mike Pompeo, is back. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=24.76s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, to follow up a little bit on a very good analysis by both Colonel North [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=29.2s)]
*  and you and Aaron, who we just heard from. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=33.6s)]
*  So, with this ground war beginning, certainly the net result that Israel is going to need [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=36.48s)]
*  out of this is that neither Gaza nor Lebanon can remain launching pads for rockets being [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=43.28s)]
*  fired into Israel. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=51.68s)]
*  The second very important goal has to be the tunnels, which we spoke of earlier, the network [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=53.32s)]
*  of tunnels. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=58.2s)]
*  So I want to walk through this, if I can with you, front by front. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=59.6s)]
*  So the first front, first battle is going to be Gaza. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=65.24000000000001s)]
*  That ground war has begun. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=69.56s)]
*  Now we would expect that Hezbollah is going to ratchet up their rocket attacks from the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=71.44s)]
*  north. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=75.68s)]
*  Now we have a two-front war. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=76.68s)]
*  Then you have the threat of Syria. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=78.52000000000001s)]
*  We have talked about the threat of the Houthi rebels from Yemen. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=79.84s)]
*  And then the Iranians themselves. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=84.88s)]
*  What the strategy has to be to cut off the head of the snake. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=88.24s)]
*  But if it's a one-front war, I think they handle it. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=93.6s)]
*  I think they can handle the two-front war. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=96.4s)]
*  Where do you see the most trouble and the greatest danger for Israel right now? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=98.84s)]
*  And how would you go about it? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  Well, Sean, I agree. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=103.88s)]
*  The more fronts, the more complexity. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=107.36s)]
*  We should also remember that there are diplomatic and political fronts as well that they'll [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=109.72s)]
*  be confronting. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=114.03999999999999s)]
*  Just today at the United Nations, only 17 countries voted against demanding a complete [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=115.16s)]
*  ceasefire of the victim. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=119.96s)]
*  And so they've got a very complex information campaign that they are fighting as well. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=121.96s)]
*  And now they're going to be fighting the Biden administration that has demanded a humanitarian [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=126.12s)]
*  pause. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=130.32s)]
*  We all know that's silly, right? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=131.32s)]
*  A hundred million dollars going there is going to be a hundred million dollars worth of more [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=132.72s)]
*  fuel, a hundred million dollars worth of tunnel reinforcements, a hundred million dollars more [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=135.68s)]
*  munitions. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=139.68s)]
*  That's what the Hamas terrorists will actually use that money for. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=140.76000000000002s)]
*  So they've got that information warfare front as well. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  The United States can play the central role at preventing these other fronts from opening. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=148.36s)]
*  So I think you may have even neglected another front, Judean Samaria, the West Bank. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=152.88s)]
*  America can have a role in keeping containment in the West Bank. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=158.28s)]
*  It can certainly do good work making clear to the regime in Iran that there'll be real [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=161.72s)]
*  costs imposed on them. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=165.96s)]
*  Colonel North did a fine job of talking about some of them. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=167.36s)]
*  For example, today, Sean, today, four million barrels of crude oil were sold by the Iranians. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=170.24s)]
*  Just as we sat here today while they're holding Americans hostage and their foreign minister [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=174.68s)]
*  was in New York. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=178.52s)]
*  We can do simple things, things that are non-kinetic that can impose real costs on the Iranian [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=179.98000000000002s)]
*  leadership convincing them that they need to restrain these proxy forces. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=184.60000000000002s)]
*  A second, when they come after Americans, you can't just fire back at munitions. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=189.04000000000002s)]
*  When they attack American soldiers and we fire at ammunition depots, that basically [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=193.88s)]
*  validates that. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=199.68s)]
*  That seconds the Iranian understanding of the weakness that the Iranian leadership saw [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=200.68s)]
*  in Afghanistan, that they have seen when the Chinese spy balloon flow over our country. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=204.88000000000002s)]
*  We have to get America back on its front foot in a way that actually will that will convince [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  the Iranians that opening up these other fronts would be a detriment to them, not to their [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=214.96s)]
*  proxies, not to the folks in Iraq or Yemen, but to them. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=219.52s)]
*  If we get that right, Sean, we can deter more fronts than the Israelis can handle. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=223.38s)]
*  And then we just need to give the Israelis all the space to make decisions for themselves, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=228.07999999999998s)]
*  to do the necessary, which is to ensure that something like what happened on October 7th [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=231.95999999999998s)]
*  never is possible of happening again to them. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=236.72s)]
*  No, I can't say it any better. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=238.92s)]
*  It is sad to see, you know, the fact that all of this money, international aid money, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=240.6s)]
*  American taxpayer dollars, have been spent to help build infrastructure, schools, hospitals, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=247.16s)]
*  and all of that money wasted on a network of tunnels and a terror network for one purpose, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=252.52s)]
*  and that is the stated goal in Hamas's charter, which is the elimination of Israel with the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=258.16s)]
*  help, support, the scheming, military plotting, planning of Iran. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=265.32s)]
*  Specifically, what should the world's reaction to Iran be? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=270.76s)]
*  Let me go back. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=275.6s)]
*  As secretary of state during the Trump administration, you guys accomplished something I never thought [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=276.84000000000003s)]
*  I'd see in my lifetime. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=282.52000000000004s)]
*  You created an alliance between the United States and Israel and Egypt and Jordan and [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=284.28000000000003s)]
*  Saudi Arabia and the Emirates, and you stood together. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=290.52000000000004s)]
*  We had intelligence sharing at levels we'd never had before, mostly a private relationship, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=294.68s)]
*  but I was very aware of it. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=301.32s)]
*  When I'd interview you, you'd give me a little smile, which kind of let me know that [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=303.52000000000004s)]
*  path and I was trying to put pieces from sources together, but your CIA roots were held very [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=308.92s)]
*  strong. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=315.24s)]
*  You never gave me a real clue, but I know we had this. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=316.24s)]
*  Can you talk about that alliance? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=319.88s)]
*  Can we achieve that alliance again? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=321.8s)]
*  And it was really to stand against Iranian hegemony in the region and them ever getting [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=325.48s)]
*  a nuclear weapon. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=330.92s)]
*  Can we get back to that? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=332.96000000000004s)]
*  O'Shaugham, we certainly can, but it takes American leadership. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  You're right. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=341.08s)]
*  Our theory of the case was this. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=342.08s)]
*  We wanted good things for the Palestinians, but we knew in order to get that, appeasing [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=343.24s)]
*  Iran wasn't the direction for that. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=348.24s)]
*  In the same way, demanding that Israel stand down is not good for the people who are living [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=350.64s)]
*  in Gaza either. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=354.2s)]
*  We understood that Iran was a threat not only to Israel, the little Satan, and to the United [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=356.15999999999997s)]
*  States, the great Satan, but a threat to people living in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, people [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=360.4s)]
*  living in Bahrain, people living in the Emirates. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=364.64s)]
*  And we isolated Iran. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=367.2s)]
*  We literally, for the first time, had Iran on an island, stuck, trying to figure out [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=369.0s)]
*  how is they're going to get back from the pressure that had been put on them, economic [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=373.56s)]
*  pressure, diplomatic pressure, and when they began to act out, military pressure. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=378.0s)]
*  Sean, remember too, we were very clear about our support for Israel. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=382.96s)]
*  Not only did we move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, but we declared the Golan [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=386.88s)]
*  Heights the rightful property of the Jewish people, their rightful homeland. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=391.52000000000004s)]
*  Those were things that so much in the establishment of foreign policy said those will create World [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=395.08000000000004s)]
*  War III. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=398.8s)]
*  Well, we can see, you create risk of that very kind of regional or even potentially [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=399.8s)]
*  global conflagration when you're weak, when you invite the Iranians to do precisely what [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=405.8s)]
*  they did by unleashing Hamas on 1,300 civilians in the southern part of Israel. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=410.40000000000003s)]
*  We have to understand, and both of your stories tonight, Sean, make clear, I think, to all [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=416.36s)]
*  of us here in America, evil still roams the earth. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=421.12s)]
*  And there is a responsibility to ensure that when it happens, when that evil exposes itself, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=423.88s)]
*  that we do everything we can to prevent it from impacting those who are good human beings [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=428.72s)]
*  trying to do the right thing. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=432.72s)]
*  We know who the victim is here. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=434.12s)]
*  We know who the aggressor is here. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=435.36s)]
*  And America simply needs to stand on the side of those people who are fighting for basic [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=437.0s)]
*  human decency. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oSFQ-fetQ&t=440.96000000000004s)]
