# Pentagon is ‘itching’ to get America in another war: GOP rep
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8)
*  There have been nearly 100 attacks on U.S. forces in the Middle East since October 17th. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=0.0s)]
*  This comes as Congressional Republicans push for border reform to be a part of a new aid [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=5.04s)]
*  package for Israel and Ukraine. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=9.76s)]
*  Joining me now to discuss is Tennessee Republican Congressman and member of the House Foreign [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  Affairs Committee, Tim Burchett. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=16.0s)]
*  Congressman Burchett, welcome. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=18.16s)]
*  Thank you all for having me. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=20.52s)]
*  So nearly 100 attacks on American forces in Iraq and Syria. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=22.0s)]
*  What more should the commander-in-chief be doing, sir? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  Well, first of all, we've got to quit freeing up money supposedly for humanitarian aid. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  We know money is fungible and it just flows right into the military coffers. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=35.36s)]
*  And, you know, we fund these our own tax against us and then we have the Pentagon itching to [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=40.400000000000006s)]
*  get us into another war. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=45.6s)]
*  I think a lot of times you're going to have to ask yourself the question, why are we there? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=47.92s)]
*  Is there a constitutional reason that American fighting men and women are put in harm's way? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=52.24s)]
*  And why doesn't anyone fear us anymore? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=58.32s)]
*  Obviously, Trump's not in the White House. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  No one fears this presidency. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  It is a rudderless ship. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  We're all over the world. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=66.72s)]
*  We're in conflicts everywhere. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=67.76s)]
*  We're spending American tax dollars that we don't have. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=69.84s)]
*  And it's just continued down this same path. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  To funding for Ukraine, we noticed in the new Fox poll a jump there. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  Thirty one percent now saying the United States should be doing more to help the Ukrainians. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=79.84s)]
*  That's up from 21 percent a month ago. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=84.64s)]
*  Does that suggest to you President Zelensky's visit to Washington was successful? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=87.6s)]
*  And how does this play out in Congress? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  Well, the mainstream media is constant. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=95.28s)]
*  It's just unbelievable. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  They've got their guy in the White House, so they're going to obviously prop him up [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  no matter what in the world. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=105.6s)]
*  And they want him to look strong with American tax dollars. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=107.75999999999999s)]
*  But this has shades of Vietnam written all over it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  We send our money over there. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=114.08s)]
*  They steal half of it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=115.52s)]
*  We send armaments. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=117.2s)]
*  They're not qualified to use them. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=118.48s)]
*  We have to send advisors. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=120.08s)]
*  Then American boys and girls are on the ground. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=122.0s)]
*  And we need to look at these other countries. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=124.64s)]
*  In Europe, they're using a—we're actually sending hard dollars and armaments over there. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=129.6s)]
*  They are saying, well, we're taking their dadgum refugees. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=135.76s)]
*  And that's part of the equation. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=139.2s)]
*  That doesn't work that way. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=140.96s)]
*  We're taking the refugees just the same. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=142.16s)]
*  America is incredibly involved in this conflict over there. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=144.32s)]
*  It's a bad deal for us. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=150.56s)]
*  It's not our war. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=152.23999999999998s)]
*  And it's going to be our war because Putin will drag us into it. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=153.84s)]
*  He knows what he's doing. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=157.68s)]
*  Europe, specifically countries like Germany, need to be kicking in more. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  And they're not. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  And there again, we've got a toothless dragon in the United Nations. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=165.12s)]
*  And there again, more money going down a rat hole. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=169.28s)]
*  In these ongoing talks with the administration over funding for Israel, funding for Ukraine, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=172.4s)]
*  Republicans are pushing for meaningful border security provisions. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=177.44s)]
*  In the Fox poll, President Biden's polling on the border issue is 33% approved, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=182.0s)]
*  63% disapprove. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=187.68s)]
*  Are you confident something significant on the border will get done? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=190.16s)]
*  No, I'm not. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=196.24s)]
*  If you saw the NDAA, you saw a lot of Republicans, frankly, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=196.96s)]
*  and some liberal Democrats who should not be fired up about the FBI spying on American citizens [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=200.8s)]
*  but are being allowed to through that. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=208.32000000000002s)]
*  So I have very little confidence in Congress right now in either party doing the right thing. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=210.4s)]
*  It's a disgrace, though, that they would tie anything to our border. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=216.16000000000003s)]
*  Our border ought to be the most important thing. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=220.16000000000003s)]
*  You talk about fentanyl, you talk about the cartels, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  you talk about 100,000 children that are unaccounted for in the last three years. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=227.68s)]
*  The horrendous things that are going on to them right now, to me, is unimaginable. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=232.4s)]
*  Yet this White House and the Marxists in Congress continue to stonewall any type of border security [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=236.8s)]
*  that we have. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=244.4s)]
*  We are showing our audience live aerials from the border from Eagle Pass, Texas. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=245.60000000000002s)]
*  And looking at the latest Fox poll, in terms of issues most important to both parties, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=251.20000000000002s)]
*  for both parties, the economy is number one. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=257.76s)]
*  But there's a big split from there. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=260.8s)]
*  At the bottom of the screen, immigration border, Democrats say that's, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=263.2s)]
*  5% only say that's an important issue. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=267.68s)]
*  35% of Republicans say that's a very important issue. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=270.48s)]
*  Does that surprise you based on what we see happening every day at our southern border, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=274.16s)]
*  including at Eagle Pass right now? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=279.68s)]
*  Again, it's the propaganda machine at the left. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=282.56s)]
*  And these folks are just spoon-fed this information from our college campuses [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=285.44s)]
*  and our public universities again. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=289.28s)]
*  And what else? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=291.44s)]
*  I'm surprised that anybody even is even concerned about the border until, of course, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=292.48s)]
*  there's a crime or a friend of theirs, as a friend of mine was killed by an illegal alien, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=297.84s)]
*  or the fentanyl. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=303.52s)]
*  The reason they don't want to attack fentanyl is because it's coming in over the border. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=304.48s)]
*  The sex trafficking and everything else, the slave labor, our own chambers of commerce [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=309.04s)]
*  are in bed with this bunch. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=313.52s)]
*  So they get the free labor. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=314.64s)]
*  They get them in the resort towns, cleaning the rooms, digging the ditches, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=316.0s)]
*  working in the poultry factories, you name it. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=321.68s)]
*  We have ourselves to blame for this whole mess, and it's just going to get worse. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=325.68s)]
*  And you talk about affecting the economy. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=330.71999999999997s)]
*  I know they get their free slave labor this way. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=332.4s)]
*  But when I was mayor of Knox County, we had one school that had over 20 different languages [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=335.44s)]
*  that were spoken in that school, a very small school, less than, I believe, 500 children. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=342.0s)]
*  So you got to ask yourself, what does these outlying costs, especially to our emergency [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=346.88s)]
*  rooms and our physicians there and our health care, just on down the line, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=351.76s)]
*  I think America better wake up about this thing, or we will be overthrown. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=356.8s)]
*  And they're not going to take it from us. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=362.24s)]
*  We're just giving it to them. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=365.52s)]
*  And that's exactly what we're doing by allowing this to continue. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=366.8s)]
*  To think that we're worried about the border between Ukraine and Russia [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=369.76s)]
*  and our own southern border. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=372.96s)]
*  Millions and millions of people have come over just in the last few years. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=374.88s)]
*  And that's those are the people you and I are subsidizing. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=379.76s)]
*  Our poor veterans are living under bridges. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=382.8s)]
*  And yet these folks are coming in and we give them a phone, we give them health care, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=386.96s)]
*  we give them clothing, we give them a place to live, all at our expense. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=392.48s)]
*  Congressman Tim Burchard of the great state of Tennessee, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=396.24s)]
*  thank you for your time today, sir. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=398.4s)]
*  Thank you, brother. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=400.56s)]
*  I really appreciate you. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=401.28s)]
*  I hope you have a very politically incorrect Merry Christmas. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=402.23999999999995s)]
*  Merry Christmas. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvBlTXwpm8&t=405.12s)]
