# Jack Keane: Hamas realizes they're at a breaking point
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU)
*  So we wanted to have a look right now what's happening in the Middle East and we can count upwards of some 87 hits against [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=0.0s)]
*  US forces serving in the region and a lot of them come back to the Houthi rebels in Yemen. Who are they? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=6.08s)]
*  Not a designated terrorist group because this administration removed them back in February of 2021. Their slogan? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=12.56s)]
*  Pretty predictable. Death to America, death to Israel, curse the Jews. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=19.98s)]
*  We've heard a lot about that right now and the Houthis control about 80% of the country of Yemen. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=23.92s)]
*  They've been fighting a civil war there for more than five years at the moment. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=29.12s)]
*  Also the country of Yemen located down here in the southern stretch of the Saudi Arabian Peninsula is the poorest country in the Arab world. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  Well, what does that mean to the rest of the world? You've got the Suez Canal here coming to the Red Sea. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=41.160000000000004s)]
*  You see these commercial [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=46.36s)]
*  Freightliners, right? You've got a choke point down here in Yemen. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=48.839999999999996s)]
*  You've got another choke point over here in the Strait of Hormuz that leads in the Persian Gulf and look what country is located there. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=51.64s)]
*  That is Iran and as we know Iran has significant influence throughout the entire region. They've got influence in Syria, Lebanon. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=57.44s)]
*  We've seen it in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank and certainly they have influence down here in Yemen. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=65.36s)]
*  So what will we do about it? So far not much. General Jack Keane joins us and General, good morning to you on a Monday. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=70.84s)]
*  I think the answer is pretty clear as of today this administration will not take action against the Houthis in Yemen. You disagree? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean they they've issued sanctions against them. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=86.84s)]
*  They're likely going to continue to use escorts to protect the commercial shipping in the area. Certainly [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=90.28s)]
*  we're taking defensive action, you know to protect our ships and Israel's taking action to protect itself. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=96.6s)]
*  But clearly that has been inadequate. We all can see it. Your board reveals it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=103.96s)]
*  What has to be done is we have to go on offense and we have to escalate. We have to [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=110.6s)]
*  take the risk to escalate to gain some dominance. Not just over the Houthis [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=116.8s)]
*  but over Iran who's using all of their proxies in the region to do what? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=121.88s)]
*  To weaken Israel, that's what Hamas and Hezbollah is all about and also [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=127.82s)]
*  eliminated as a nation state eventually. The Houthis are part of that and certainly the Iranian [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=133.74s)]
*  backed Iraqi proxies and Syrian proxies as well as the Houthis want to drive the United States military presence out of the region. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=140.62s)]
*  We have to recognize that Iran is calling the shots here and we have to escalate [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=147.5s)]
*  also to give them the warning that we're not going to tolerate that and take some military action against something that they value. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=153.58s)]
*  Reagan figured that out. He achieved escalation dominance. Trump figured that out and now this administration [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=161.57999999999998s)]
*  has got to find the spine to do the very thing. Why don't they do it Bill? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=168.1s)]
*  They don't do it because they think if they do escalate and take this kind of aggressive military action [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=172.66s)]
*  that it could lead to war with Iran. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=178.9s)]
*  But the 43 years of history in dealing with Iran suggests that's not the case. Why? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=181.98000000000002s)]
*  Because that's why they developed the proxies. They've had these proxies for all of those years to provide distance [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=188.06s)]
*  from the United States. They don't want war with the United States. Why? They lose their regime. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=195.22s)]
*  That's why they want a nuclear weapon to preserve the regime. They're not going to put that at risk. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=201.08s)]
*  We should step up and be more aggressive. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=206.01999999999998s)]
*  General, I wanted to also ask you about the hostages. Of course, we keep them top of mind. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=209.54s)]
*  So Hamas was put under a ton of military pressure by the Israeli Defense Forces [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=213.57999999999998s)]
*  and then they said they needed a break. We had the temporary ceasefire. We had some hostages released. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=218.78s)]
*  Well now Hamas is saying that all remaining hostages will be killed if more aid and prisoner exchanges are not met. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=224.62s)]
*  So if you're Israel or even President Biden, do you keep the military pressure on Hamas so that they come to the table [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=234.78s)]
*  to give the hostages back? Or do you worry that the hostages might be killed? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=241.5s)]
*  Well, the hostages clearly are the regime leaders of Hamas's lifeline. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=247.74s)]
*  They're threatening to kill them. But if they did that, certainly their regime will be absolutely destroyed. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=254.70000000000002s)]
*  Which is the military objective here. What do they really want? The pressure on Hamas is very real. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=261.82s)]
*  There's pressure in the north as they're cleaning up northern Gaza and also in Hanunis, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=269.26s)]
*  systematically building by building, street by street, taking Hamas down. Many of them are [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=275.26s)]
*  surrendering. They know that some of their ranks are breaking. So what do they really want here? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=281.1s)]
*  They haven't said it, but they're implying that they want to ceasefire. If they have a hostages [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=286.46s)]
*  exchange, they're going to a ceasefire. They want to stop the bloodshed that they're suffering as a [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=291.09999999999997s)]
*  result of it. The Israelis have claimed they've killed about six or seven thousand of them or [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=297.97999999999996s)]
*  captured. Most of them killed, some captured. And that is going to continue. So that's the [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=303.17999999999995s)]
*  pressure point here. They want a ceasefire to stop the military success that Israel is having against them. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=308.38s)]
*  And you know in Jewish tradition how much they covet the human body. And apparently there are [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=316.46s)]
*  20 hostages who are confirmed dead in Gaza, but their bodies are still there. And in all likelihood, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=325.65999999999997s)]
*  General, you could have Hamas start to negotiate for the corpses of these hostages in order to [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=332.62s)]
*  exact something out of the Israeli government. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=339.34s)]
*  Well, there's no doubt about it. We said that one of the characteristics of Hamas's campaign [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=341.34s)]
*  that was very different. One was the focus on killing civilians in the initial attack on October [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=349.58s)]
*  the 7th. And the second one was taking wholesale hostages, something they have never done before. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=355.02s)]
*  And we knew that the hostages would play prominent here in the military action going forth. And Hamas [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=360.94s)]
*  is leveraged to use those hostages to benefit themselves. And we see that at play right here. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=368.38s)]
*  General Jack Keane, thank you for being with us on a Monday to kick us off. We appreciate it. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyKET1ZldU&t=375.34s)]
