# Four Israeli hostages freed after 8 months in captivity: IDF
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [June 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8)
*  And for more on this incredible rescue operation, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=0.0s)]
*  let's bring in Mitchell Barak. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=2.5s)]
*  He's an American-Israeli pollster, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=3.64s)]
*  former aide to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  also a speechwriter for former Prime Minister Shimon Peres [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=8.32s)]
*  and Ariel Sharon, and joins us from Jerusalem. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=11.58s)]
*  Mitchell, good to see you. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=14.88s)]
*  I mean, it really is a testament to the professionalism [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=16.04s)]
*  and dedication of the Israeli forces [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=19.52s)]
*  to pluck those four and the others [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=21.92s)]
*  from the clutches of the terrorists of Hamas. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=23.52s)]
*  Your reaction to this? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=26.04s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=28.36s)]
*  I mean, we found about it. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=29.32s)]
*  It's now nighttime. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=30.48s)]
*  Shabbat is over. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=31.36s)]
*  The rumors were all over for us that are Sabbath observers, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=32.56s)]
*  and don't turn on the phone. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=35.6s)]
*  But everyone in the streets here in Jerusalem, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=37.08s)]
*  in our neighborhood, was celebrating and talking [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  to each other. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=42.26s)]
*  As soon as the names were mentioned, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=43.64s)]
*  many of us knew who those hostages were, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=45.32s)]
*  especially Noah Argimani and her very unique story [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=48.64s)]
*  and the pictures from when she was kidnapped on October 7. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=51.46s)]
*  It is unbelievable to see those pictures, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=54.92s)]
*  those people with their families, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=57.24s)]
*  and we're just hopeful that more hostages will be freed. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=59.04s)]
*  And it looks like the military operation [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=61.84s)]
*  was extremely daring and successful. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=64.2s)]
*  And unfortunately, one of the commanders [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=66.56s)]
*  lost his life there, and that's a very unfortunate thing, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=69.56s)]
*  but everyone is very, very happy at this point. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  That commander, Arnon Zamara, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=76.84s)]
*  he was a national police terrorism commander [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=79.12s)]
*  who was fatally wounded in this. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=82.32000000000001s)]
*  And there's a photo we're showing now [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=83.92s)]
*  of the commander, Zamara. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=85.92s)]
*  You have to think of his sacrifice, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=88.6s)]
*  an indication of what the Israeli people go through. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=90.36s)]
*  And I'm reminded of Jonathan Netanyahu, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=92.72s)]
*  who lost his life in the daring Raiden and Tebbi, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=95.32s)]
*  the prime minister's brother, of course. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=98.14s)]
*  Speak to me about the resolve of the Israeli people, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=100.36s)]
*  of the IDF, of men and women, like Commander Zamara. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  You know, it's interesting. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=109.47999999999999s)]
*  The commander is the person that gets killed [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=110.82s)]
*  because the commander is one of the first people [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=112.96s)]
*  to go into an operation like that. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=115.02s)]
*  It's not like the commander is in the back, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=116.5s)]
*  unlike the Islamic resistance Hamas people [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=118.53999999999999s)]
*  who hide, you know, put the civilians in front [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=121.53999999999999s)]
*  and hide behind it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=123.94s)]
*  The Israeli commanders, who are much more experienced, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  go in first, and then they lead the soldiers behind them. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=127.36s)]
*  The resolve of the Israeli people is very serious. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=130.82s)]
*  I mean, I can tell you, I have a son who's in the army, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=133.07999999999998s)]
*  who's in one of these units, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=136.22s)]
*  and these boys and girls are very, very committed. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=138.3s)]
*  I come from the generation of people [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=142.56s)]
*  that has seen our children, our sons and daughters, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=144.74s)]
*  turn into our heroes. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=147.14000000000001s)]
*  These are the ones that are going in. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=148.78s)]
*  These are the ones that are motivated. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=150.28s)]
*  These people believe that they have thousands of years [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=152.34s)]
*  of Jewish history and the Jewish future on their shoulders, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=155.62s)]
*  and that is why there is such a fight among them [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=160.3s)]
*  to get into the most elite units, to the combat units, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=163.5s)]
*  and that is why that motivates them every single day. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=166.46s)]
*  We pray and think of your son and all the youngsters. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=169.88s)]
*  I've met some of them in Israel, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=173.9s)]
*  the sons and daughters of normal, everyday people [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=176.26000000000002s)]
*  who have their rifle on their back and come home [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=179.22s)]
*  and can't tell you exactly where they are deployed. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=181.86s)]
*  It's amazing as an American, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=185.34s)]
*  we don't have that here in our country, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=187.06s)]
*  but in Israel you do have that sacrifice. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=189.34s)]
*  And what is your sense then of other young people [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=192.1s)]
*  on the streets of the country today? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=194.98000000000002s)]
*  They're out in front of the White House [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=196.74s)]
*  saying, free Palestine. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=198.86s)]
*  How about free Palestine from Hamas? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=200.62s)]
*  What would you say to those who are criticizing Israel? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=202.3s)]
*  Yes, there have been mistakes. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=205.10000000000002s)]
*  Yes, there are tragedies, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=206.26000000000002s)]
*  but look at what your country is undergoing [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=207.94s)]
*  with a terrorist organization whose headquarters [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=210.62s)]
*  is basically in Iran that wants to wipe out the Jewish state. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=213.98000000000002s)]
*  It's a terrible thing, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=218.3s)]
*  and when we've seen the leader of Iran [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=219.34s)]
*  who tweeted in Hebrew, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=221.58s)]
*  that is the end of the Zionist entity, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=223.5s)]
*  we see the beginning of the end. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  But what's even more disappointing [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=227.94s)]
*  is when the Iranian president is killed in a helicopter crash, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=230.14s)]
*  no one here in Israel was sorry about that, of course, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=234.57999999999998s)]
*  but yet there was a moment of silence in the United Nations, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=236.94s)]
*  and the secretary general of the United Nations [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=239.98s)]
*  actually signed the very special condolence book. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=242.42s)]
*  I mean, what is that? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=245.45999999999998s)]
*  They call for the destruction of another country. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=246.38s)]
*  They actively support terror, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=248.7s)]
*  not only of the Islamic resistance Hamas, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=252.06s)]
*  but also the Hezbollah, the party of God in Lebanon, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=254.85999999999999s)]
*  and the Houthis who are also firing from Yemen on Eilat. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=257.66s)]
*  What do we have with the Houthis? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=260.82000000000005s)]
*  Meaning they see this, their nuclear arsenal [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=262.62s)]
*  that they want to create [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=266.14000000000004s)]
*  in order to use against Israel and the Jewish people. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=268.90000000000003s)]
*  So, the Palestinians in Gaza, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=271.5s)]
*  it's quite ironic that Israel left there in 2005 [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=275.3s)]
*  in a unilateral withdrawal under Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=280.46000000000004s)]
*  I worked in that office when he was prime minister, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=283.86s)]
*  and it was criticized by many Israelis. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=287.18s)]
*  And, you know, the Hamas with their 250 miles of tunnels, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=289.86s)]
*  that's a long enough tunnel to go from the Fox studio [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=295.26s)]
*  in New York to the Fox studio on Capitol Hill in Washington. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=297.82s)]
*  And believe me, you can fit a million people [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=301.1s)]
*  in 250 miles of tunnels. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=303.34000000000003s)]
*  Why isn't that the Hamas didn't open any tunnels [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=305.74s)]
*  for any of their people to hide from the Israeli attacks [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=308.86s)]
*  against the terrorists? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=312.26s)]
*  Meaning it's so ironic to see what's going on [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=313.82s)]
*  in the United States and on campuses. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=318.05999999999995s)]
*  I mean, it is June, which is Pride Month. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=320.38s)]
*  We see queers for Palestine, which is ludicrous [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=322.73999999999995s)]
*  because there are no queers in Palestine. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=325.85999999999996s)]
*  They're executed. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=328.34s)]
*  It's not allowed under Islamic law, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=329.46s)]
*  and there's a capital punishment. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=331.29999999999995s)]
*  In Gaza and Ramallah, they throw these people off the roofs. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=332.9s)]
*  But they've come up with this, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=336.09999999999997s)]
*  this is the cause of today to free Palestine. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=337.9s)]
*  The world has become a little bit topsy-turvy at this point. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=342.9s)]
*  But as you know, you asked about the resilience [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=346.26s)]
*  of the Israeli people, what do the Israelis think? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=348.62s)]
*  We're used to having the world against us. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=350.82s)]
*  I can say that having the support of the United States, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=352.82s)]
*  having the support of the White House, of the Congress, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=355.58s)]
*  the invitation to Prime Minister Netanyahu to come, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=358.62s)]
*  a bipartisan invitation, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=362.18s)]
*  meaning our friends are in the United States [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=364.14s)]
*  and in the normal countries. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=366.58s)]
*  And there's a lot of countries [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=368.58s)]
*  that are not normal anymore [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=369.9s)]
*  because not only are they negotiating, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=372.38s)]
*  they favor terror organizations. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=373.74s)]
*  They favor those that kill innocent civilians [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=376.02000000000004s)]
*  and then hide behind their own innocent civilians. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=378.7s)]
*  And had the Palestinians in Gaza, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=381.22s)]
*  who had an election in 2006, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=384.94s)]
*  imagine what they could have done with the Gaza Strip. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=387.46000000000004s)]
*  They were so good at building tunnels underground, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=390.94s)]
*  better than anyone in the world, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=393.94s)]
*  so good at trying to find better and new [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=395.3s)]
*  and improved ways to kill Israelis, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=398.18s)]
*  they probably could have made a really great place [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=400.78s)]
*  out of that Gaza Strip, beachfront property [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=402.9s)]
*  with some very smart people there, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=405.65999999999997s)]
*  but they chose, you know, radical death and destruction. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=407.53999999999996s)]
*  Radical Islamic terrorism [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=411.26s)]
*  at the expense of Western values. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=413.41999999999996s)]
*  Hamas wants to kill the Palestinians themselves [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=416.5s)]
*  for their own propaganda. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=419.41999999999996s)]
*  Let's hope that the democracy [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=421.41999999999996s)]
*  and integrity of the world succeeds and it will. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=423.73999999999995s)]
*  Mitchell Barak, thank you so much. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_MU1O2EgE8&t=427.02s)]
