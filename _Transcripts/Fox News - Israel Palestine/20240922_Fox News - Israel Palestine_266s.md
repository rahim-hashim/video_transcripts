# Samaritan's Purse donates armored ambulances to Israeli community
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [September 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM)
*  As fears grow of an all-out regional war groups from around the world are stepping in to help those affected in Israel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=0.0s)]
*  Joining me now is the president of Samaritan's Purse Reverend Franklin Graham Reverend welcome [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=5.48s)]
*  Thank you, would you tell our audience about the effort you've made to address a need in these armored ambulances that you're providing [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=11.58s)]
*  Well right after October 7th, we made a commitment to replace the 14 ambulances that [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=20.64s)]
*  Look again Davey to dome [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=27.78s)]
*  Lost that day, but we realized that they didn't have enough [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=30.1s)]
*  Armored ambulances, so we have replaced those 14 [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=35.18s)]
*  And we've committed now to 42 ambulances and the rest are being armored [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=38.88s)]
*  you know when you when you're trying to respond to a shooting or something right on the border of Gaza or [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=43.66s)]
*  Lebanon [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=50.66s)]
*  These ambulance drivers are at great risk and the patients they carry are great risk [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=52.14s)]
*  And you've got to do whatever you can to try to protect them so Samaritan's Purse. I was there this week [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=57.46s)]
*  We've dedicated two ambulances down at the Avi Shalom a community on the very southern part near Egypt and [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=63.86s)]
*  these were [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=72.14s)]
*  named in honor of [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=73.86s)]
*  three Americans [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=76.58s)]
*  That were killed [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=78.38s)]
*  And so we had some of their family members there, and we've got six construction sites [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=80.26s)]
*  We're building two ambulance centers two trauma centers [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=85.62s)]
*  In the square and therapy center for children as well as an OBGYN center in a Bedouin community [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=90.02000000000001s)]
*  This is a Muslim community that's inside of Israel. They suffered at the hands of these terrorists, so this is just [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=97.06s)]
*  Some of the things that Samaritan's Purse is able to do [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=104.66000000000001s)]
*  I wonder if you can share with us the emotion of when those ambulances were delivered to these communities [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=107.34s)]
*  Well, I mean, they're so grateful to have these are these are brand new modern [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=115.62s)]
*  ambulances and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=121.78s)]
*  They were just they kind of overwhelmed by it and not I told these people [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=123.9s)]
*  As I tell everyone these come from God [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=130.66s)]
*  God is the one who's provided it and that in times of trouble we need to turn to God [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=133.44s)]
*  We need to look to him and he is our our refuge in done a time of trouble and so we were able to [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=138.36s)]
*  to dedicate these [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=147.08s)]
*  In God's name to his glory [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=149.76000000000002s)]
*  You're doing the ambulances. You've delivered a lot of food as well [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=152.88s)]
*  What more is Samaritan's Purse doing to help people in need over there? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=156.56s)]
*  Well as you've seen these rocket attacks from the north [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=163.44s)]
*  You still have a large segment of the Israeli population that is not able to go to their homes in the north [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=167.68s)]
*  They have been in kibbutz's in the central part of the country. They've been in hotels [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=175.20000000000002s)]
*  And so what we've done is we provide gift cards. These are [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=180.4s)]
*  Cards that allow them to go to a local convenience store some something similar to their version of 7-eleven [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=185.8s)]
*  And that helps them by just the things that they may need that the government doesn't give them [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=191.6s)]
*  And so it gives them the little ability to go and purchase something on their own and so we provided [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=196.6s)]
*  Thousands of those and we'll continue to do this [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=203.44s)]
*  We've given out food, but the big thing is these these gift cards out that really helps them [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=206.66s)]
*  To live and to try to have some kind of normal life, but right now [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=213.08s)]
*  There's nothing normal there while we were at F. Shalom on the Egyptian Gaza border [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=217.64s)]
*  You could hear [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=223.83999999999997s)]
*  Heavy machine gunfire you could hear cannons going off [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=225.55999999999997s)]
*  We were not able to get close to the border because of they're still fighting in Gaza [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=229.67999999999998s)]
*  There's still I was still a dangerous place [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=235.44s)]
*  and there's a there's a lot that Israel needs to do to try to wrap this up to finish this and [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=237.44s)]
*  They just [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=243.56s)]
*  It's not going to be an easy task [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=245.04000000000002s)]
*  And so we just need to stand behind Israel and have their back during this very difficult time [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=246.6s)]
*  We've been showing our audience Samaritan's purse org is your website for people who are interested at home Reverend Franklin Graham [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=251.24s)]
*  Thank you for the amazing work you continue to do God bless you, sir [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=257.76s)]
*  God bless you. Thank you, sir. Thank you [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlyYzzvHXM&t=262.56s)]
