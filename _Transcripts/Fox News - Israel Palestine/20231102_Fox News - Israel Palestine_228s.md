# Biden unveils 'national strategy' to counter Islamophobia amid antisemitism surge
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q)
*  An opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal warning Democrats that the party is tearing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=0.0s)]
*  itself apart over Israel and that it could be split for a generation facing negative [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=4.28s)]
*  political consequences because of it. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=8.9s)]
*  It all comes as progressives continue inflammatory rhetoric like this. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=11.02s)]
*  I am a co-sponsor of the ceasefire resolution. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=16.12s)]
*  We're seeing refugee camps bombed. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=18.12s)]
*  We're seeing thousands of children who have died. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=19.84s)]
*  This is not war. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=22.740000000000002s)]
*  This is chaos. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  And we have a responsibility to uphold our standards and commitment to human rights. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=27.68s)]
*  I believe bombing refugee camp is a human rights violation. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=32.28s)]
*  I believe it's a war crime. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=36.08s)]
*  Wow. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=37.08s)]
*  Joe Hagel is a Democrat, Maryland state delegate and U.S. congressional candidate. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=38.08s)]
*  Joe joins me now. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=42.24s)]
*  Sir, how disheartening is it to hear your fellow Democrats basically abandoning the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=43.24s)]
*  Jewish people? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=49.36s)]
*  Look, Todd, great to be with you this morning. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=50.36s)]
*  And okay, it's no secret that we have strong disagreements within our own party. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=53.24s)]
*  I think what's disheartening right now, though, is that, you know, Congress has a responsibility [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=56.919999999999995s)]
*  because of three weeks of delay, because of the chaos and disarray within the Republican [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=61.48s)]
*  Party. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=65.32s)]
*  We've delayed funding to our key ally, Israel. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=66.32s)]
*  And now because of continued political games that the Republicans in Congress are playing, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=68.96s)]
*  we're continuing to delay that funding that Israel critically needs for its security at [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=72.84s)]
*  this moment in time. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=76.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=77.64s)]
*  But, Joe, you know this goes well beyond the House Republicans because there's this, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=78.64s)]
*  announcing the establishment of the first ever national strategy to counter Islamophobia. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=83.92s)]
*  This happened yesterday. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=90.12s)]
*  The Biden administration availing this, all as anti-Semitism itself skyrockets. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=91.12s)]
*  I mean, Joe, you yourself in that article called this the battle for the soul of our [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=96.6s)]
*  party. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=101.28s)]
*  Ari Fleischer calling this move by the Biden White House a political move to hold on to [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=102.28s)]
*  Muslim votes in swing state Michigan, all as Arab-American support for the president. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=106.74000000000001s)]
*  Literally, in a poll this week, dips from 59 percent to 17 percent. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=111.68s)]
*  What's your reaction, Joe, when you see the leader of your party do this clearly based [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  upon politics and not what is right for your people, the Jewish people? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=121.36000000000001s)]
*  Look, while Republicans in Congress were competing against each other to see who had the most [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=125.80000000000001s)]
*  anti-LGBTQ, anti-woman, pro-Trump message to be the next speaker of the House, President [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=131.36s)]
*  Joe Biden was flying to Israel, flying to an active war zone, reaffirming the United [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=136.36s)]
*  States' support for Israel. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=141.0s)]
*  And he has put out strategies to combat anti-Semitism, put out strategies to combat anti-Semitism [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=142.84s)]
*  on college campuses. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=147.96s)]
*  But we also have to recognize that there is a rise in Islamophobia around this country. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=148.96s)]
*  And I'm glad that the president of the United States has been a leader on all three of those [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  fronts. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  OK, but, Joe, you just said anti-LGBTQ stuff. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=158.04000000000002s)]
*  You yourself are a gay man. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=161.12s)]
*  And when you see members of your party and kind of the administration, if you will, supporting [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=163.18s)]
*  many Hamas-connected groups, you know what happens to members of the LGBTQ-plus community [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=168.32000000000002s)]
*  in Hamas, right, Joe? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=173.96s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=176.24s)]
*  And look, I have been clear in condemning Hamas and reaffirming the United States needs [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=177.24s)]
*  to be actively engaged in supporting Israel as they are engaged in this battle to defeat [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  Hamas terrorists. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=187.76000000000002s)]
*  Look, and the best thing that the United States can do right now, the most critical responsibility [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=188.76000000000002s)]
*  is to make sure that Israel gets the security funding they need to root out Hamas terrorists. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=194.68s)]
*  But right now, because of the political games that these anti-LGBTQ Republican leaders are [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=200.08s)]
*  playing in Congress, we are continuing to delay this critical funding that Israel needs [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=205.16s)]
*  to protect its civilians and defeat Hamas. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=210.0s)]
*  Look, Joe, I think at the end of the day we all know Israel is going to get this funding. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=212.36s)]
*  It's just a matter of how, and obviously there's a policy disagreement. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=215.08s)]
*  And I wouldn't go so far as to say the entire Republican caucus there is anti-LGBTQ, but [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=217.88s)]
*  we're going to have to leave it there. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=223.48s)]
*  Joe Vogel, we appreciate your time this morning. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=224.72s)]
*  Thanks so much. Appreciate it. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1PfykRy6Q&t=226.56s)]
