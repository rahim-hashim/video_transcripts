# BREAKING: Israel scraps vote on cease-fire deal, accuses Hamas of going back on terms
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs)
*  Let's first go to Trey Yankston, Israel, with the latest on the Israel-Hamas deal. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=0.0s)]
*  Trey, good morning. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=4.96s)]
*  Yeah, hey, Todd Carley, good morning. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=6.96s)]
*  The region is waiting for the implementation of this ceasefire deal that is scheduled to [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=9.44s)]
*  go into effect on Sunday. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=13.86s)]
*  The Israeli cabinet was scheduled to vote today on the deal. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  That would be followed by a 48-hour period that would allow for objections in the Israeli [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=20.28s)]
*  Supreme Court. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=24.44s)]
*  But we've just received a statement from the prime minister's office claiming that Hamas [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=25.44s)]
*  is going back on some of the agreements. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=29.88s)]
*  This could be political spin, but we'll have to wait and see what more we can find out. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=31.96s)]
*  Diplomatic conversations are continuing at a high level urging stability in the deal. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=35.96s)]
*  A statement released by the prime minister's office overnight said, quote, Prime Minister [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=40.8s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu spoke this evening with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and thanked [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=44.32s)]
*  him for his assistance in advancing the release of the hostages and for helping Israel bring [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=48.6s)]
*  an end to the suffering of dozens of hostages and their families. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=53.019999999999996s)]
*  Inside Gaza, Palestinian civilians welcomed the agreement after living through more than [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=56.76s)]
*  15 months of war. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=60.64s)]
*  Last night's atmosphere was filled with joy. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=64.8s)]
*  Everyone was happy. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  Everyone was looking forward to this for nearly a year. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=69.58s)]
*  Thank God. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=72.44s)]
*  He sent us this and the people rejoiced. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=73.62s)]
*  There's a lot of anticipation here on the ground about this statement that was released [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=78.6s)]
*  by the prime minister. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=82.64s)]
*  We've been talking with the negotiating teams in Doha, Qatar, trying to get a better understanding [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=84.16s)]
*  of what's actually taking place. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=88.84s)]
*  They've not raised any red flags. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  They're pointing to the prime minister's statement and a response that we just got from Hamas [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=92.36s)]
*  this hour saying they agree to what is on the table presented by the mediators. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=96.42s)]
*  We will have to follow this throughout the day to see if this deal is going to go into [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=101.4s)]
*  effect and if it will be voted on later today. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Carly. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=107.8s)]
*  Trey, you know, I was just going to ask if you're a family member of one of the hostages, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=108.8s)]
*  how should you be processing this news that this vote is delayed and Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=112.68s)]
*  Netanyahu is pointing fingers at Hamas for reneging on portions of it? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=117.68s)]
*  Should you be concerned that this ultimately doesn't cross the finish line? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=121.94000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=125.68s)]
*  Look, these families have been waiting for 468 days to be reunited with their loved ones. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=127.16000000000001s)]
*  They were taken on October 7th during the massacre, dragged into Gaza, and they've been [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=133.02s)]
*  doing everything possible coming here to hostage square and demonstrating calling for a deal [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=137.76000000000002s)]
*  to take place. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=142.01999999999998s)]
*  And you can just imagine the swing in emotions last night with President Biden and President [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=143.01999999999998s)]
*  elect Trump saying there is a ceasefire deal. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  It's ready to go and that hostages will start to come out of Gaza on Sunday. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=149.89999999999998s)]
*  And then seeing the statement this morning by the prime minister. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=154.0s)]
*  And so certainly these families are going to be urging the Israeli government to do [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=156.6s)]
*  whatever it takes to try and meet Hamas at the table and get a deal together so that [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=160.28s)]
*  they can be reunited with their loved ones starting this weekend. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=165.33999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=167.98s)]
*  The public sentiment inside Israel is split regarding this deal. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=168.98s)]
*  Everybody wants the hostages home, but exchanging them for that number of terrorists obviously [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=172.06s)]
*  leaves people very concerned. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=177.56s)]
*  Trey, we have to leave it there, but thank you so much for bringing us the latest. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=179.06s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM44riUziAs&t=181.95999999999998s)]
