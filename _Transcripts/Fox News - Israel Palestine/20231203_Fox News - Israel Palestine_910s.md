# Mark Levin: Democrat Party and media in this country are 'CORRUPT AS HELL'
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI)
*  I want to read you something very important to lay the foundation that was in the American [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=0.0s)]
*  Spectator by Rabbi Dov Fisher. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=4.96s)]
*  And if you listen to the American media, which are basically propagandists for the Democrat [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=8.92s)]
*  Party and the Biden regime, you would think that Donald Trump is Hitler. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  No, worse than Hitler, that he wants to execute and imprison everybody. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=18.6s)]
*  And if he's not Hitler, he's Stalin. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=22.48s)]
*  If he's not Stalin, well, he's Mussolini. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=24.64s)]
*  He's all these horrid things. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  And we know this to be the case because Joe Scarborough said so. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=29.44s)]
*  And whatever Joe Scarborough says, of course, is very, very crucial. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  And that's regurgitated by Media Matters and Mediaite and the usual Democrat Party propaganda [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  network. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=41.400000000000006s)]
*  But I want to set the record straight, thanks to this rabbi. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=42.68s)]
*  He wrote, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  I don't know why Donald Trump loves Jews. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  Maybe because more than 90 percent of Orthodox Jews voted for him against both Hillary and [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=49.14s)]
*  Joe Biden. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=53.52s)]
*  Maybe because his daughter is an Orthodox Jew. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=55.16s)]
*  Maybe because Jared Kushner is son-in-law whom he loves and trusts as an Orthodox Jew. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=57.44s)]
*  Maybe because Trump's grandchildren are Orthodox Jews who observe the Shabbat according to [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=62.559999999999995s)]
*  its law, eat strictly kosher or ten Yisheva Jewish parochial school. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=67.24s)]
*  Or my personal theory, he says, maybe because his father Fred, who was one of the great [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=72.28s)]
*  philosemites, that is, Jew supporters, of the prior generation, who even donated property [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=77.44s)]
*  to a Jewish congregation for them to have a synagogue, taught young Donald that part [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=83.66s)]
*  of the Trump family legacy is to love Jews. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=88.06s)]
*  Now, isn't this interesting? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=90.25999999999999s)]
*  So the American media, which is so detestable and unconscionable, so totally immoral, tries [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=92.34s)]
*  to turn Donald Trump into an anti-Semi-Jew hater, when in fact he has spent his entire [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=99.82s)]
*  life supporting Jews and Jewish causes, as had his father. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=106.46s)]
*  But I want to get into something more specific because I want to juxtapose this with Biden [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=112.9s)]
*  and the Biden regime and the Democrats. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=116.46000000000001s)]
*  When others refused to hire Jews, Trump did, number one. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=120.06s)]
*  He opened the restricted Mar-a-Lago private club to blacks and Jews when he bought it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=122.98s)]
*  Number two, he surrounded himself with honorable Jewish legal scholars and attorneys like David [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=127.14s)]
*  Freeman and Jason Greenblatt, and even a bum named Michael Cohen, whose kids Bar Mitzvah [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=132.20000000000002s)]
*  he attended. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=137.58s)]
*  In Israel, Trump would be elected prime minister by a landslide, after nearly half a century [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=138.9s)]
*  of broken promises by other American presidents. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=143.46s)]
*  Three, Trump formally declared and America recognized United Jerusalem as Israel's capital. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=145.86s)]
*  Four, he moved America's Israel embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=151.22s)]
*  Five, he recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=155.58s)]
*  Six, he recognized the permanent legality of all Jewish communities and cities in Judea [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=159.5s)]
*  and Samaria. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=165.22s)]
*  Seven, he cut off hundreds of millions of dollars funding for Abu Mazen, that is, Mohammed [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=167.14s)]
*  Abbas, the head of the Palestinian Liberation Organization that was founded by Arafat. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=176.94s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=181.82s)]
*  Because they were having pay for slay, that is, paying Palestinians to murder Jews, terrorism. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=183.05999999999997s)]
*  This is what Biden Blinken referred to as the moderate Palestinians, the PLO Fatah party. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=189.56s)]
*  He closed down the PLO office in Washington, did Trump. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=195.54s)]
*  Number nine, he closed down America's long-standing Palestine consulate in Jerusalem. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=199.01999999999998s)]
*  Ten, pulled the United States under the anti-Semitic UN Human Rights Council. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=203.42s)]
*  Eleven, cut off 300 million in funding that Americans had been sending to the Jew-hating [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=208.1s)]
*  UNRAE, Jew-hating UN agency that runs schools in places like Gaza, where Arab Muslim children [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=213.62s)]
*  are taught to hate Jews and to murder Jews. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=219.82s)]
*  Number 12, appointed a UN ambassador, Nikki Haley, who warned anti-Israel countries that [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=222.7s)]
*  were taking down names. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=227.42s)]
*  Thirteen, almost unilaterally brought about the Abraham Accords that induced several leading [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=229.33999999999997s)]
*  Arab Muslim countries for the first time to enter into the true peace agreements with [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=233.82s)]
*  Israel without Israel ceding an inch of Jewish territory in Judea and Samaria to the Palestinians. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=238.5s)]
*  Fifteen, his education secretary, Betsy DeVos, endorsed Yeshiva education during visits to [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=244.06s)]
*  two Yeshivas on a New York City trip while skipping visiting the city's public schools. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=249.86s)]
*  Sixteen, Trump issued an executive order on combating anti-Semitism to enhance enforcement [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=255.42000000000002s)]
*  of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act to protect Jewish college students from the overt Jew [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=260.3s)]
*  hatred now rampant on so many American campuses. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=265.74s)]
*  You know, other presidents could have done that. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=268.42s)]
*  So he takes the Civil Rights Act, this Title VI part, and he signs an executive order, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=271.54s)]
*  and the suits that are being brought against these universities now are being brought under [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=277.78s)]
*  this part of the act as a result of Donald Trump's executive order. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=281.9s)]
*  Seventeen, he named Kenneth Marcus as Assistant Secretary of Civil Rights at the Department [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=286.02s)]
*  of Education to investigate anti-Semitic episodes at campuses like Rutgers University. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=290.84s)]
*  Oh, the good old days when there was one campus. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=296.02s)]
*  Now there's so many you can't even count them. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=299.05999999999995s)]
*  Trump deported the last Nazi war criminal known to be hiding in America. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=301.65999999999997s)]

*  No more American money goes to the PLO, you know, the moderate Arabs, because they keep [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=317.98s)]
*  killing and using our money to kill Jews and Americans. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=322.54s)]
*  Number 22 knocked off Qassam Soleimani, the head of the IRG for Iran. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=328.70000000000005s)]
*  Number 23 rubbed out Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the head of ISIS. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=334.62s)]
*  He shattered State Department policy by authorizing Americans born in Jerusalem to list Israel [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=340.06s)]
*  or their American passports as their country of birth. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=345.3s)]
*  That was controversial before, if you can believe that. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=348.3s)]
*  He imposed sanctions on the International Criminal Court for unfairly and illegally [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=351.18s)]
*  investigating Israel. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=354.74s)]
*  And he said in his 2019 State of the Union address, quote, we must never ignore the vile [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=356.78000000000003s)]
*  poison of anti-Semitism or those who spread its venomous creed. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=361.94s)]
*  With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=369.90000000000003s)]
*  And this is the man they call Hitler because he used the word vermin. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=376.7s)]
*  Because the Democrat Party and the media in this country are corrupt as hell. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=383.6s)]
*  The Abraham Accords from StandWithUs.com is a series of treaties normalizing diplomatic [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=388.9s)]
*  relations between Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan, Morocco, facilitated [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=394.82s)]
*  by Trump and his people. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=400.94s)]
*  Israel already had relations with Egypt and Jordan, and they were on the precipice of [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=404.62s)]
*  having diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=409.65999999999997s)]
*  This was groundbreaking. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=413.62s)]
*  This was unimaginable, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=414.82s)]
*  And even Dennis Ross, a former Middle East peace envoy for the U.S., wrote that the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=418.14s)]
*  U.A.'s move, quote, should also signal to Palestinians that others are not going to [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=423.02s)]
*  wait for them to make peace with Israel. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=427.82s)]
*  He hadn't figured out Trump did. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=430.68s)]
*  And peace broke out throughout the Middle East. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=432.71999999999997s)]
*  He left the Middle East in peace for the next administration, the relations with Israel. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=435.5s)]
*  And it was Iran. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=442.78s)]
*  It was Iran that was in trouble. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=444.5s)]
*  Why? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=446.06s)]
*  Trump had had enough with Iran. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=447.06s)]
*  Not only did he take out Soleimani, which made it clear to all the leaders of that Islamo-Nazi-Tiranian [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=448.34s)]
*  regime, that he could take any of them out, any of them out. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=454.14s)]
*  So he stopped them from doing a number of things. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=459.9s)]
*  For instance, as a result of his sanctions on oil, on trade, on finance, on everything [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=463.02s)]
*  he could put his stamp on, according to the BBC, this is just two, let's see, just three [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=470.36s)]
*  or so years ago, Iran's economy has fallen into a deep recession. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=478.28000000000003s)]
*  Iran's oil exports have plummeted. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=485.36s)]
*  Their currency, halved in value, halved in value. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=488.96000000000004s)]
*  In other words, their economy was collapsing. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=491.88s)]
*  The living costs rose dramatically for the average Iranian. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=494.62s)]
*  And the people were rising up. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=499.6s)]
*  The protests, which continue to this day. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=502.0s)]
*  But the Iranians have butchered and brutalized those people, most of whom are women and teenage [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=505.44s)]
*  girls who stood up against the dress policies and so forth. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=510.32000000000005s)]
*  The protests represent the culmination of a dramatic and widespread shift in Iranian [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=513.86s)]
*  attitudes of the people and an increased appetite for risk in voicing opposition to the regime. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=518.36s)]
*  They talk about more than 4,000 street protests, 21,000 protesters have been arrested. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=525.0s)]
*  More than 550 people have been murdered. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=530.86s)]
*  And the support for the protests and against the regime hit every age, every demographic [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=534.24s)]
*  in Iran and so forth. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=540.92s)]
*  Now, why am I bringing all this up? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=542.24s)]
*  Because Biden and Blinken and Sullivan and all the rest of these reprobates are funding [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=544.92s)]
*  the Iranian regime either directly, indirectly, without enforcing all of the provisions that [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=551.56s)]
*  Donald Trump put in place to choke out that regime economically, like Reagan choked out [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=560.3s)]
*  the Soviet Union and collapse it and expand peace in the Middle East. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=564.7199999999999s)]
*  The Biden administration took the opposite position, rearming Iran, taking off all of [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=570.7199999999999s)]
*  the Trump waivers or refusing to enforce them, all of them. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=576.04s)]
*  Direct ties through back channels and directly the appointment of individuals who are special [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=580.52s)]
*  pleaders for Iran, which makes it, as I said before, the alter his case look like a joke. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=586.04s)]
*  Selling out America on the nuclear deal, selling out America across the board in these waivers, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=592.1999999999999s)]
*  they were given even before negotiations began because of this odd, grotesque Obama ideology, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=597.64s)]
*  which is being passed on by the Obama staffers, all of whom now work for Biden from Blinken [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=605.88s)]
*  on down, that they have to build up Iran. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=610.64s)]
*  They have to empower Iran. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=613.4399999999999s)]
*  Iran's economy needs to be strong while they weaken Israel, while they begin the process [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=615.12s)]
*  of controlling Israel, quote unquote, demilitarizing Israel. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=621.3199999999999s)]
*  Because the problem in the Middle East, according to Biden, Blinken, Sullivan, according to [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=626.92s)]
*  Obama and Thomas Friedman, the problem in the Middle East is Israel. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=632.44s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=638.2s)]
*  And so you can see the complete change from one administration to the next. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=639.76s)]
*  Meanwhile, Biden today and Blinken doing his shuttle diplomacy behind the scenes, they [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=643.48s)]
*  are undermining, sabotaging Israel and the Netanyahu government. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=648.52s)]
*  They don't want them to win against Hamas. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=652.8000000000001s)]
*  In fact, they're siding with Hamas. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=656.96s)]
*  They won't say it openly. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=658.8000000000001s)]
*  Openly, they have what they call the big hug. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=659.88s)]
*  See we're with Israel. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=662.28s)]
*  Well as I said last night, they're stabbing him in the back. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=664.92s)]
*  Hamas, war crimes, using civilians as human shields. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=668.92s)]
*  That's a war crime under the Geneva Conventions. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=673.68s)]
*  War crime, ordering their civilians not to flee so they would be harmed. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=677.3199999999999s)]
*  War crime, using rape as a weapon of war against the Israeli women. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=683.4s)]
*  War crime, targeting specifically women and children, even babies. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=689.84s)]
*  War crime, targeting and slaughtering Israeli civilians. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=695.3199999999999s)]
*  War crime, stealing humanitarian and civilian aid to support their terrorist activity. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=700.4s)]
*  War crime, and yet it's Israel who's admonished publicly and constantly over and over again, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=706.16s)]
*  protect the civilians. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=710.92s)]
*  Do not displace Palestinians in southern Gaza. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=712.96s)]
*  In fact, don't even go into southern Gaza. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=715.76s)]
*  Even more. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=718.4000000000001s)]
*  Don't fight in southern Gaza. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=719.4000000000001s)]
*  Now most of Hamas has moved into southern Gaza away from the north, so they don't [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=721.0400000000001s)]
*  want Israel to win. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=725.24s)]
*  Provide a steady flow of fuel and other provisions without interruption, even though everybody [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=726.6s)]
*  knows Hamas is stealing it and nobody has control over it. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=731.64s)]
*  And so the Biden administration, blinking and all the rest, they're actually giving [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=734.9200000000001s)]
*  aid and comfort and support, just as they are to Iran, to Hamas. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=741.56s)]
*  Just as Iran is to Hamas, just as Iran is to Hezbollah, and as far as civilian deaths [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=749.4399999999999s)]
*  are concerned, let me reiterate something. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=753.92s)]
*  The Biden regime, Blinken, Sullivan, this mouthpiece Kirby, they never talk about all [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=757.64s)]
*  the Iranians that have been slaughtered by that regime. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=763.04s)]
*  They never talk about all the Syrians, hundreds of thousands that have been slaughtered by [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=767.1999999999999s)]
*  that regime. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=771.26s)]
*  They never talk about all the people who have been slaughtered in all of these places in [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=772.26s)]
*  the Middle East, including, yes, Saudi Arabia, yes, Iraq, and in other locations, including [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=778.1s)]
*  Turkey, right there on the outskirts. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=785.3000000000001s)]
*  Erdogan's busy slaughtering people who disagree with him, too. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=787.98s)]
*  Never talk about Islamophobia in the Middle East, that is, Muslims slaughtering Muslims. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=790.98s)]
*  They never talk about humanitarian aid and support for all of those people and so forth. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=797.02s)]
*  Biden's never confronted Xi about the slaughtering of Muslims, Uighurs. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=804.66s)]
*  No, not in the least. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=808.38s)]
*  It's just Israel, which isn't slaughtering anybody. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=810.86s)]
*  They're fighting a war to protect themselves. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=814.38s)]
*  Let me tell you something, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=816.66s)]
*  If Joe Biden had been president during World War II, we would have lost. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=818.46s)]
*  We wouldn't have beaten the Germans. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=823.5799999999999s)]
*  The Germans would be saying, OK, we have some hostages here, some POWs. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=825.62s)]
*  We want to do an exchange for a ceasefire. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=830.6600000000001s)]
*  Would he have agreed to bombing of Dresden when the U.S. when the RAF and the U.S. Air [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=834.58s)]
*  Force did? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=838.98s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=839.98s)]
*  How about the obliteration of Berlin? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=841.3000000000001s)]
*  Would he have agreed to that? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=842.9000000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=843.9000000000001s)]
*  How about the obliteration of towns and cities across Europe as we fought our way back with [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=844.9000000000001s)]
*  our allies to defeat the Axis powers? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=849.24s)]
*  No, he wouldn't have agreed to that. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=851.82s)]
*  And of course, he wouldn't have agreed with Harry Truman on how to end the war with Japan, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=853.64s)]
*  the dropping of two atomic bombs, which at the time was not so controversial, but of [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=858.72s)]
*  course is today. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=864.0s)]
*  All that said, the last time we really won a major war was World War II. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=865.84s)]
*  And I think we get way too used to waging wars and having no intention of winning them. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=872.12s)]
*  And in the case of Israel, they have to win every single one of them. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=877.0400000000001s)]
*  Israel has a monkey on its back and it's called Joe Biden. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=881.2s)]
*  And they're expected to defeat this enemy with both hands tied behind its back. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=885.72s)]
*  And they're expected to carve up their country into two countries, five countries. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=890.36s)]
*  And so that's why it's important that we have the guests that we have today. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFS76fRwCI&t=894.5600000000001s)]
