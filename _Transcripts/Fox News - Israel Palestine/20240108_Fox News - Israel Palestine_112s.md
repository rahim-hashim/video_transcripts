# IDF: Hamas has cruise missile capabilities stemming from Iran
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [January 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvbdex2EB6c)
*  The aforementioned Secretary of State Antony Blinken will return to Israel today after meeting with Arab leaders about their role in the future governance of Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvbdex2EB6c&t=0.0s)]
*  Meantime, the IDF says they have evidence proving Hamas has cruise missile capabilities, which they say are made possible by Iran. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvbdex2EB6c&t=8.38s)]
*  Trey Yanks live in Tel Aviv this morning with the very latest. Trey. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvbdex2EB6c&t=16.92s)]
*  Hey Todd, good morning. It is day 94 of the war between Israel and Hamas. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvbdex2EB6c&t=21.72s)]
*  Tonight, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is scheduled to arrive once again here in Israel. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvbdex2EB6c&t=26.56s)]
*  He'll meet with top officials about a variety of topics, but focused on the next steps for the war in Gaza and also how to avoid a broader regional conflict. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvbdex2EB6c&t=31.92s)]
*  We also understand this stop does follow conversations in both Jordan, Qatar and a number of other locations, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvbdex2EB6c&t=41.26s)]
*  included the UAE, where Blinken was reportedly firm about the U.S. position that Palestinians should not be displaced from Gaza. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvbdex2EB6c&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  Jordan's King Abdullah II warned of dangerous repercussions if the war does continue. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvbdex2EB6c&t=55.76s)]
*  One of those repercussions could be a war with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvbdex2EB6c&t=60.559999999999995s)]
*  Over the weekend, Hezbollah fired 40 rockets into northern Israel and what the group called the initial response for the killing of the Hamas deputy chairman in Beirut. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvbdex2EB6c&t=64.64s)]
*  Iran-backed groups continue to fund and operate across the Middle East and in this region, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvbdex2EB6c&t=73.47999999999999s)]
*  And according to the Israeli military, Iran was directly responsible in part for Hamas' rocket capabilities. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvbdex2EB6c&t=79.44s)]
*  A new report citing South Korea's spy agency also indicated Hamas is using weapons in their fight against Israel that were previously smuggled from North Korea. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvbdex2EB6c&t=86.04s)]
*  Now, the coming weeks and months will be incredibly difficult for the Israelis, as there is an understanding, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvbdex2EB6c&t=95.72s)]
*  according to senior officials here, that the clock is running out to find a diplomatic solution to avoid a broader war. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvbdex2EB6c&t=100.92s)]
*  Todd? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvbdex2EB6c&t=108.28s)]
*  Trey Yanks live for us in Tel Aviv. Trey, thank you. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvbdex2EB6c&t=108.84s)]
