# Netanyahu adviser: Calls for Israeli cease-fire are calls for Hamas to remain in power
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk)
*  So this is getting a lot of attention today as we look at the images of 239 hostages on [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=0.0s)]
*  the wall, loved ones who people are waiting for at home and they do not know anything [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  about their condition in most cases. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  So Israel and Hamas are reportedly close to a deal to free most of the Israeli women and [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=15.66s)]
*  children held hostage for more than a month now in exchange for the release of Palestinian [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=21.64s)]
*  women and young people in Israeli prisons and a temporary ceasefire possibly for five [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=27.34s)]
*  days. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=34.5s)]
*  That according to the Washington Post Foreign Affairs columnist David Ignatius, he reports [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=35.5s)]
*  Israel wants all 100 women and children released, but Hamas is offering 70 hostages according [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=39.019999999999996s)]
*  to Ignatius's reporting. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  Let's go live now to Tel Aviv and Mark Regev, senior advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=49.22s)]
*  Netanyahu. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=54.58s)]
*  Ambassador Regev, good to have you with us. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=55.58s)]
*  Good to have you with us today, sir. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=57.3s)]
*  I want to ask you about that clearly, but first I do want to get your reaction to what [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=58.66s)]
*  we've been watching on the National Mall here in the United States. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=63.019999999999996s)]
*  And also, the president did not appear at that today. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=67.36s)]
*  What's your reaction to that? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=72.5s)]
*  So I'm thrilled and I think all Israelis are to see this support in Washington today. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=75.06s)]
*  People standing up for the U.S.-Israel alliance, people standing up for my country at a time [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=81.7s)]
*  of war, people demanding the release of the hostages. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=86.42s)]
*  I think this is very, very positive. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=89.97999999999999s)]
*  And of course, condemning anti-Semitism. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=92.1s)]
*  You know, anti-Semitism is they say it's the world's oldest hatred, but it has staying [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=94.58s)]
*  power and it's important we fight it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=100.1s)]
*  And I applaud all of those people who've taken the time to go and stand there on the mall [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=102.22s)]
*  in Washington. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=107.17999999999999s)]
*  I think it's fantastic. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=108.17999999999999s)]
*  So President Biden chose not to go. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=109.94s)]
*  The vice president is also not there. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=112.06s)]
*  What message does that send? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=115.22s)]
*  So I don't know about their schedules. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=117.8s)]
*  I know that often my prime minister wants to go to events and he can't because of other [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=119.94s)]
*  commitments. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=124.22s)]
*  I'm in no position to judge. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=125.22s)]
*  And do you believe that, you know, that their support is holding because there are all of [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=129.66s)]
*  these letters that have been written by members of the State Department and the National Security [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=136.62s)]
*  Council of people urging him to back down a bit in his support for Israel and to support [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=142.36s)]
*  the Palestinian cause and to stop the bombing? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=148.36s)]
*  Let's be clear. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  Anyone who calls for a ceasefire today is calling to keep Hamas in power. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  That's the bottom line. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=160.16000000000003s)]
*  And if Hamas stays in power, Israelis will continue to live next to this terror enclave [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=161.48000000000002s)]
*  on our southern frontier. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=167.08s)]
*  And that's unacceptable. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=168.94000000000003s)]
*  The Hamas leadership has said publicly since the terrible massacre of October 7th that [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=170.64s)]
*  given the opportunity, they would do it again and again and again. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=176.04s)]
*  And Israelis shouldn't have to live in fear of these terrorists coming across the border [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=181.56s)]
*  once again and killing their children, burning, raping, beheading. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=186.72s)]
*  These sort of terrorists must never again be allowed to attack us. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=193.68s)]
*  And the only way to achieve that is to eliminate their control of Gaza. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=196.67999999999998s)]
*  That will be good for the people of southern Israel who will no longer have to live with [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=202.76s)]
*  this threat. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=206.04s)]
*  But it's also good for the people of Gaza who deserve better than this bunch of cutthroats [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=207.04s)]
*  that have been running their society. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=211.1s)]
*  So let's talk a little bit about this trade and how close is it to happening? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=214.6s)]
*  And is Israel willing to turn in Palestinian women and children who they say are in your [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=221.08s)]
*  prisons in order to get these hostages back, the women and children back? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=228.08s)]
*  If we are close to a deal for the release of our hostages, and as you said correctly, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=234.92s)]
*  almost 240 people held of them 32 children and of the children babies and infants. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=241.52s)]
*  And they always ask us to remember what sort of people kidnap babies and infants. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=248.48s)]
*  What sort of people can kidnap a nine month old baby? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=254.0s)]
*  They really are sick. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=258.12s)]
*  They really are depraved. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=259.36s)]
*  What more can one say about Hamas? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=261.4s)]
*  But if they are moving towards releasing hostages, it's not because they've suddenly become [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=263.76s)]
*  humanitarians. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=269.36s)]
*  It's because they've been on the receiving end of the IDF's military might and they are [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=270.8s)]
*  feeling the pain, feeling the pressure and this is forcing them to move on the hostage [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=276.64s)]
*  issue. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=281.8s)]
*  I hope we get a deal. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=282.8s)]
*  I'm not sure when that will happen, but as long as we keep the pressure up, I think we're [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=283.8s)]
*  expediting the chances that we're going to get people out. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=289.47999999999996s)]
*  Alright, Ambassador Reagan, thank you sir. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=292.24s)]
*  Good to have you with us as always. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=294.8s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=296.2s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaEh337j7Uk&t=298.02s)]
