# We need the U.S. to stand with us unequivocally, says incoming Israeli Ambassador to UN
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [July 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes)
*  I want to go to Danny Danon, the former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=0.0s)]
*  Come next month, he's going to be becoming the Israeli ambassador to the UN. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=3.92s)]
*  So, Danny, always good to have you. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=9.28s)]
*  And I'm just wondering what you made of this. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=11.92s)]
*  Not so much the protests outside. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=14.8s)]
*  I think your government, our government, was prepared for that. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=16.72s)]
*  Didn't really have the man and woman power to deal with that. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=19.92s)]
*  But it is sadly what it is. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=23.84s)]
*  But the way Benjamin Netanyahu had to go to, obviously, President Biden, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=25.92s)]
*  to go to Kamala Harris, to go to Donald Trump, he covered all his bases. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=32.56s)]
*  But it was the meeting with Kamala Harris that generated the most controversy and anger on [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=36.56s)]
*  Netanyahu's part, much being said that some of the stuff that she claimed in a public [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=42.56s)]
*  press remark after that one-on-one, she never said to him in that one-on-one. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=48.16s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=56.8s)]
*  First, if you look at the visit, it was a very successful visit of Prime Minister Netanyahu, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=58.4s)]
*  a very powerful speech in the House and the meeting with the President, the Vice President, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=62.72s)]
*  and President Trump. And I think it was very important. It wasn't easy for the Prime Minister [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=69.36s)]
*  to leave Israel once we are at war. You know, we are thankful for the support of the U.S. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=73.68s)]
*  We don't agree about everything. It's legitimate. But I think ones need to understand that what's [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=79.04s)]
*  happening here in the U.S. is different than the calendar in Israel. You are very busy about the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=85.84s)]
*  election cycle, who will be elected. But Hamas, Hezbollah, Iran, they are not waiting until [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=90.16000000000001s)]
*  November or until the new president to step in in January. We have to take actions today and now. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  And I think that message was delivered very clearly by the Prime Minister. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=102.88s)]
*  This is one of those rare times, though, Ambassador, where Ben Netanyahu took issue [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=108.64s)]
*  with a top U.S. official to say her remarks, in this case Kamala Harris's, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=115.28s)]
*  were essentially detrimental to this process and securing what seemed to be an agreed-to [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=123.28s)]
*  deal with Hamas to release hostages. I'm sort of paraphrasing to get to the point here. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=129.2s)]
*  But was it that bad? Well, I think the main problem is Hamas. They are not rational actors. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=134.72s)]
*  They are playing with the negotiators, even the U.S. and Egypt and other players trying to [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=141.28s)]
*  break a deal. But it's not happening because of their actions. So I wouldn't give credit to [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  anyone else for the delays. We know that Hamas don't want a real deal. They don't care about [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=152.64s)]
*  the suffering of the hostages or the suffering of the people in Gaza. And we have to be strong. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=157.2s)]
*  We have to continue with the real efforts. And we rely on the support of the U.S. We need the U.S. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=162.72s)]
*  to stand with Israel. When you have a strong ally, you need them in a time of war. And now we are [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=167.76s)]
*  under attack from so many fronts. We need the U.S. to stand with us un-nucleically. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=172.48s)]
*  Well, we haven't been standing with you as strongly as we have in the past. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=178.95999999999998s)]
*  You've been second-guessed on your military strategy. And it seems to be a continuation [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=183.28s)]
*  with Kamala Harris. Does that worry you? Well, we spoke a lot about this issue in the past, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=188.88s)]
*  and that we have to take the decisions ourselves, even if it means that sometimes we don't agree [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=194.79999999999998s)]
*  with our strongest ally. And when you look at history, when we attacked the nuclear reactor [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=199.68s)]
*  in Iraq, the U.S. condemned us back then. It was President Reagan who was a friend of Israel [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=204.64s)]
*  many other occasions. So at the end of the day, we know better the Middle East, we know better the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=210.08s)]
*  enemies, and we know how to deal with them. But like Prime Minister Netanyahu said, our victory [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=215.6s)]
*  will be your victory. So even if you don't agree, the U.S., about everything that we are doing or [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=220.8s)]
*  the timing of our actions, you have to look at the broad picture and understand that we have no [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=225.84s)]
*  choice. We have to defeat Hamas, bring the hostages, because otherwise we're going to talk in three or [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=230.48000000000002s)]
*  four years, they will come again after us. We cannot allow it. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=235.6s)]
*  Well, your government has made it very, very clear that that's your position. That could take [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=240.07999999999998s)]
*  years. You've heard Donald Trump say, and he echoed it again with Benjamin Netanyahu in Mar-a-Lago, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=244.48s)]
*  that this has got to wrap up quickly. If he became president, he would make sure [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=250.64s)]
*  that it did wrap up quickly, but it can't wrap up quickly as things stand now. I think you've [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=254.4s)]
*  talked in terms of years. So is that what we're looking at? And do you expect any better treatment [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=259.44s)]
*  from a potential Trump administration than you would get from a Kamala Harris administration? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=265.12s)]
*  Well, I think every president will understand that it's complex. It's not going in and out. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=270.88s)]
*  When the U.S. went after what happened after 9-11, it took you a long time to find the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=276.64s)]
*  Osama bin Laden. It will take us, I hope, shorter to kill Sinwar and the other leaders of Hamas. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=284.88s)]
*  But also when you hear about the pressure to finish fast, there is a contradiction, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=291.12s)]
*  because you cannot finish fast when you're actually chasing a terror organization [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=295.52000000000004s)]
*  who is hiding behind civilians. So we want to minimize civilian casualties. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=299.20000000000005s)]
*  That's why we operate very slowly. We take the time. We make the distinction between terrorists [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=303.68s)]
*  and civilians. We cannot finish it fast, unfortunately. So the U.S. and our allies [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=308.8s)]
*  will have to be patient, and we expect them to stand with us even if it takes longer. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=314.72s)]
*  All right. We'll watch it very closely. Ambassador, thank you very much. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea848cwmxes&t=319.52s)]
