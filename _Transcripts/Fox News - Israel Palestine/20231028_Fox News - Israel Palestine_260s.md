# Subterranean warfare expert addresses challenges IDF will face in tunnels ahead of invasion
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk)
*  Israeli Defense Forces preparing for a ground invasion are reportedly considering a new weapon in their arsenal to disable tunnels [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=0.0s)]
*  terror tunnels dug by Hamas [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=7.4s)]
*  reports say the new gadget dubbed the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=9.64s)]
*  Sponge bomb is a device filled with a chemical foam that expands when triggered [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=11.88s)]
*  allowing IDF soldiers to trap terrorists in underground passageways and secure safe routes while searching for [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=17.52s)]
*  hostages retired Major John Spencer is with the Modern War Institute and [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=24.76s)]
*  the International Working Group on Subterranean Warfare [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=30.24s)]
*  He joins me now, you know about what it means to fight underground looking at that graphic [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=33.28s)]
*  Looks like this is something that's employed on the ground. How significant is this? I [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=38.6s)]
*  Mean, it's a tool I've seen actually studying the idea. It's you know, something you would use to seal like a small hole [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=44.32s)]
*  And hopefully Hamas believes it's something more than it is and they're scared of it [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=50.620000000000005s)]
*  I did call it the Sponge Bob bomb when I saw it [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=55.9s)]
*  Just think about trying to seal like a sewer opening so you can move past it rather than a you know [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=60.019999999999996s)]
*  an offensive weapon so this is I mean this is a tactical weapon that may help in some circumstances, but it's [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=65.25999999999999s)]
*  Ultimately, how do you I mean you're an expert on this? How do you deal with the tunnels if you're Israel? I [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=71.5s)]
*  Mean, there's no one solution [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=77.9s)]
*  Israel has some of the best things developed in the world from drones that bounce off the walls to attack dogs [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=79.9s)]
*  They're gonna have to approach each one [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=87.26s)]
*  Situationally because of the fact there might be hostages down there [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=89.10000000000001s)]
*  The last thing you want to do is send a soldier down there to fight but the idea of had that capability to [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=91.86000000000001s)]
*  I've heard people suggest a lot of different things. Is there a is [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=97.58000000000001s)]
*  There anything that's a catch-all on these tunnels or is it so disparate? I mean people have suggested flooding tunnels that sounds [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=101.74000000000001s)]
*  Really difficult is that conceivable? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=109.24000000000001s)]
*  I mean are there other tactics that the IDF might have to get at this holistically? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=111.48s)]
*  Well, not holistically, but I mean so there's a challenge of a tunnel when you find it like while you're tactically fighting as you might imagine [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=117.88000000000001s)]
*  Then there's what you do you do with the tunnel afterwards? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=125.72s)]
*  So that's where people start talking about how Israel has filled them with cement in the north [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  Egypt has filled them with seawater, which actually is a really [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=132.84s)]
*  Maybe a likely way to deal with these at the end of the war once they destroy all Hamas military capabilities [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=135.84s)]
*  The film with seawater from the Mediterranean like with some horizontal drilling and you'll never be able to use those tunnels again [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  Interesting interesting what our viewers are seeing right now. I don't know if you can see it or not is a graphic [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=148.64s)]
*  The IDF has put out where they have placed a lot of their terror hub their headquarters of Hamas [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=153.07999999999998s)]
*  Directly underneath Gaza's largest working hospital [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=160.60000000000002s)]
*  So it's a working civilian hospital yet their tunnel complex is right underneath it if you're the IDF and you want to defeat Hamas [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=163.52s)]
*  How do you do that with a hospital right above it? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=172.44s)]
*  Right [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=175.44s)]
*  Very carefully and I actually interviewed the idea spokesman for my own podcast about this not only are they underneath it [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=176.52s)]
*  The hospital is the entryway into this kind of tunnel complex [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=183.52s)]
*  It's actually a war crime to do that [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=187.35999999999999s)]
*  So this is how the IDF has to fight with their hands behind their back and they won't bomb it [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  They have to they'll have to assault it when if when and if that time comes very delicately even though it's a military target Hamas [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=193.96s)]
*  Conducted a war crime trying to take away the hospital's protected status in war [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=202.35999999999999s)]
*  But this is the challenge that everybody wants to talk about IDF doing war crimes [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=206.16s)]
*  Which I haven't seen a single one and by the very nature Hamas uses war crimes to take away the war crimes [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=210.88s)]
*  As a method of war there. It's ridiculous. They know exactly what they're doing. They place it there for precisely that reason [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=217.32s)]
*  Do you think eventually if if Israel is going to completely obliterate Hamas? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=224.0s)]
*  They'll have to go on the ground into that hospital into those tunnels [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=228.92s)]
*  Absolutely, you can't destroy Hamas by bombing it [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=233.24s)]
*  You have to go forward close with and destroy all of their capabilities their leadership their fighters their tunnels their rockets all of it [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=236.35999999999999s)]
*  There you go major John Spencer, thanks for your insight great stuff [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV-xY3rS9bk&t=244.46s)]
