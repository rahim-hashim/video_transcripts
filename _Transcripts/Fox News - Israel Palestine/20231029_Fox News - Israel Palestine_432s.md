# 'PLAYING FOR TIME': Israeli official says Hamas 'not serious' about releasing hostages
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4)
*  For more on the rising tensions in the Middle East, joining us now is the Israeli ambassador [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=0.0s)]
*  to the United States, Michael Herzog. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Ambassador, thank you very much for joining us on this Sunday. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=6.84s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=10.06s)]
*  I want to start with this. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=11.06s)]
*  We know that Israel is entering this new phase of this war, this new phase of the ground [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=12.84s)]
*  invasion. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=18.8s)]
*  Are we to understand, Ambassador, that this is happening now because perhaps the talks [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=19.8s)]
*  to release hostages has essentially fallen apart? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=26.36s)]
*  Well, we are expanding our operations inside Gaza to apply pressure on Hamas as part of [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=29.6s)]
*  our strategic goal of ultimately destroying the Hamas war machine. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=39.84s)]
*  We gave a chance to talk through the Qataris and others to see if we can get out hostages. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=45.68000000000001s)]
*  Ultimately, it was obvious to everybody involved that Hamas was just playing for time. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=53.44s)]
*  They were not serious about this. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=59.24s)]
*  So we are applying pressure now inside Gaza, but I still hope that our pressure will encourage [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=62.52s)]
*  them to release hostages as we move and press them on and on. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=69.8s)]
*  Well, let's talk this through because I know the two goals for Israel right now is to destroy [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=75.52s)]
*  Hamas and to also release these hostages to rescue them. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=79.6s)]
*  Some of the families in Israel of these hostages are expressing some anxiety that their loved [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=84.52s)]
*  ones are also perhaps caught up in the middle of this bombardment that we're seeing right now. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=90.36s)]
*  The AP is reporting that some of these families are open to the idea of exchanging Palestinian [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=97.84s)]
*  prisoners for their loved ones. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=103.32s)]
*  Where is Israel on that right now? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=105.72s)]
*  Right now there is no serious willingness on the other side to release hostages. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=108.68s)]
*  So this is unfortunately and tragically theoretical. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=115.36000000000001s)]
*  As I say, we welcome the release of hostages and we will give any opportunity to that end. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=121.64000000000001s)]
*  We believe that our pressure on Hamas inside Gaza may even encourage such an outcome. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  But I think right now maybe going into a public discussion about on the war terms one could [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=136.04000000000002s)]
*  release hostages is unhelpful to the real efforts which are being made behind the scenes to [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=144.52s)]
*  release hostages. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=150.60000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=151.96s)]
*  President Biden is expected to have a phone call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=153.16s)]
*  Any moment now we await that call. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=157.48000000000002s)]
*  I know that getting Americans out of Gaza is a huge priority for the State Department [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=159.52s)]
*  and the Biden administration. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=165.8s)]
*  I've been in contact with an American couple stuck in Gaza right now from Boston who have [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=167.08s)]
*  a one-year-old child. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=172.36s)]
*  They are practically starving. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=174.16s)]
*  They're thirsty. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=176.24s)]
*  They've run out of food and water. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=177.24s)]
*  How is Israel helping to release those dual citizens, Americans stuck in Gaza right now? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=178.7s)]
*  First of all, the phone call already took place a short while ago. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=186.68s)]
*  The two leaders are talking constantly to each other. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=193.08s)]
*  As for getting Americans and other foreigners out of Gaza, we are totally on board and have [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=196.44000000000003s)]
*  close cooperation, coordination with the US government. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=203.32000000000002s)]
*  The Egyptians are on board. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=207.72000000000003s)]
*  And as the National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said this morning, publicly, it is [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=209.72000000000003s)]
*  Hamas that is holding up and preventing that from happening. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=215.32000000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=219.56s)]
*  Israel has recalled its diplomats from Turkey, a huge move after Erdogan there practically [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=221.56s)]
*  called Israel a war criminal, saying that you're committing war crimes during this war. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=229.16s)]
*  The goal I know for Israel has long been to normalize relations with regional partners. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=236.28s)]
*  Is that goal at risk here? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=242.36s)]
*  Let's make a distinction between those countries who normalize relations with Israel under [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=245.32s)]
*  the Abraham Accords and others in the region who are quietly telling us go and destroy [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=252.52s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=258.28000000000003s)]
*  Publicly, they are more cautious, but they are telling us Hamas is our enemy as well [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=259.08s)]
*  and the enemy of peace in the region and stability. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=264.52s)]
*  In the case of Turkey, unfortunately, President Erdogan has gone all out against Israel, putting [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=268.28000000000003s)]
*  all the blame on us and justifying Hamas. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=274.6s)]
*  This is nothing that we can accept. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=277.8s)]
*  Let's not forget who we're talking about. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=280.6s)]
*  We're talking about Jihad, about the Jihadi barbaric organization that waged an all-out [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=283.08000000000004s)]
*  war against Israel and kidnapped over 200 people and butchered 1,400 people. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=288.84000000000003s)]
*  How can you defend such an organization? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=294.28000000000003s)]
*  This is unfathomable to us. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=296.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, you can't. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=298.76000000000005s)]
*  And my last question quickly, Ambassador. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=300.20000000000005s)]
*  There's a humanitarian crisis unfolding in Gaza. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=302.44s)]
*  Communication blackout over the weekend, although I believe some telephone lines and [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=305.71999999999997s)]
*  Internet are coming back up. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=309.4s)]
*  Thousands of people, we have video of this, broke into an aid warehouse because they were [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=311.08s)]
*  looking for flour, food, anything to feed their families. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=316.84s)]
*  I know you've previously said that you were working hard to create some sort of a [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=320.6s)]
*  humanitarian zone, a corridor to get aid in. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=324.12s)]
*  Where are we on that? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=327.56s)]
*  We are working very, very hard in close coordination with all relevant UN agencies and with the [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=328.68s)]
*  U.S. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=337.48s)]
*  government and U.S. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=337.8s)]
*  special coordinator to provide humanitarian solutions. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=338.92s)]
*  We are very mindful of the humanitarian challenges. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=342.52s)]
*  It is our duty and interest to make sure that civilians, innocent civilians, are not harmed [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=347.16s)]
*  and we're trying to get them out of harm's way, contrary to Hamas. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=354.12s)]
*  Today, we allowed in 48 trucks, truckloads of humanitarian assistance, and we're going [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=359.0s)]
*  to increase more and more. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=365.8s)]
*  In one or two days, I believe we'll be able to get 100 trucks and over into Gaza, and [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=368.84000000000003s)]
*  we're working, tracking very closely the humanitarian needs of Gaza in terms of food, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=377.08s)]
*  medical supplies, water, and all that to provide solutions. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=383.88s)]
*  This is a tragic situation. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=388.28s)]
*  It is a war that was imposed on us. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=389.88s)]
*  We do not initiate it, but we have to go after Hamas. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=392.67999999999995s)]
*  Everybody understands that. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=397.4s)]
*  We call on them not to put civilians in harm's way. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=399.71999999999997s)]
*  We're trying to get them out of harm's way. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=404.84s)]
*  You'll see more and more solutions in the coming day, including floating hospitals, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=407.64s)]
*  field hospitals, and a lot more humanitarian assistance going into Gaza. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=414.28s)]
*  We know you're working on that and we'll be following that closely, especially for [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=418.84s)]
*  our Americans that are stuck in Gaza at the Ra'afah border right now. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=422.68s)]
*  Ambassador, we could talk to you for an hour. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=426.44s)]
*  We know you're busy. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=428.03999999999996s)]
*  We very much appreciate your time. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=428.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZTkSSDa_4&t=430.91999999999996s)]
