# This is ‘damning’ evidence against the Secret Service, GOP rep says
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [September 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M)
*  For more on this, we're now joined by Republican Congressman from Texas and member of the Bipartisan [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump Assassination Attempt Task Force, Pat Fallon. Congressman, thank you for taking time [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=5.04s)]
*  on a Saturday. I want to get to your task force and whether or not President Trump, former President [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=10.24s)]
*  Trump is safe at this moment. But first, I want you to sort of react if you can to this latest news [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=16.56s)]
*  of these three Iranian nationals in this hacking attempt. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=22.32s)]
*  Well, Griff, it's very clear that we have to enforce the sanctions that are already on the books. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=25.919999999999998s)]
*  I mean, under President Trump, when the sanctions were being enforced, Iranian oil exports amounted [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=30.8s)]
*  to about $8 billion annually, and now it's up to over $42 billion. So you can sow a lot of mayhem [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=36.56s)]
*  and murder and whatnot with an extra $35 billion. We need to also go on the offensive in the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  cybersphere as well, and we need to sanction their drones, their missiles, and again, particularly [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=52.0s)]
*  their energy. Let's turn now to the safety of the former president. And we had a busy week of [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  development. I want to start with the Secret Service Director Rose sort of statement, if you [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  will. Here's what he's saying. His latest, we thank Congress for addressing some of the U.S. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  Secret Service's most immediate needs in this heightened threat environment. This short-term [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=75.68s)]
*  funding will better equip the U.S. Secret Service to enhance security measures in the months ahead. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=80.56s)]
*  He continues, we look forward to working with Congress on full-year funding to deliver the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  additional personnel, technology, and equipment our workforce needs to do their jobs. Congressman, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=92.08s)]
*  your reaction to that statement? I think that we need to be very clear here. The Secret Service [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=99.28s)]
*  has 8,000 employees and a $3.1 billion budget, and they may need a few more resources, but to [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=104.88s)]
*  sit there and ask for essentially doubling of their budget when they had an epic, historic, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=109.44s)]
*  catastrophic failure is really not going to sit well with the American people, and it certainly [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=114.08s)]
*  doesn't sit well with me and other members of Congress. It wouldn't have cost them anything, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=118.64s)]
*  Griff, to have surrounded the AGR building in Butler, Pennsylvania with local law enforcement. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  It would have cost very little to put cameras on the roof, or for that matter, local law [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=128.4s)]
*  enforcement on the roof, or had one command post and not two, or stationed somebody on the water [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=132.88s)]
*  tower. There were nine different things they could have done to prevent what happened in Butler, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=136.72s)]
*  and they chose not to do them, and almost none of them cost any money, and some cost just a teeny [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=140.8s)]
*  little fraction. So they need to embrace technology from the whistleblowers that I've talked to within [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=144.96s)]
*  the Secret Service and those that are recently retired. They say they simply need to spend the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=149.6s)]
*  money that they have more efficiently, and they said embrace technology, change some of the training, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=153.12s)]
*  and really change the culture of the Secret Service to better protect the president [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=158.96s)]
*  and the other protectees under their care. And Congressman, I would add one more to your list. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=162.56s)]
*  I mean, it was just a startling revelations of failures. One that stood out to me was the lack [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  of radio communications between the local law enforcement and the Secret Service. I want to [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=175.44s)]
*  play for our listeners just a snippet from one of the Butler Emergency Services people. Listen to [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=180.88s)]
*  this. I do not believe they could hear us at all. They did not have a radio from us, and we did not [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=187.28s)]
*  have a radio from them. So, you know, in the local command post, there was no way for us to hear [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=193.12s)]
*  any of the Secret Service radio traffic. Congressman, they're not talking to each other [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=198.8s)]
*  as former President Trump now heads back to Butler. The big question is, are you confident [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=204.16s)]
*  about his safety? I think he's, when his second trip to Butler, he'll be safer. But I, you know, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=211.2s)]
*  we need to, this is a zero, zero fail mission, Griff. And the fact that we're talking about in 2024, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=217.44s)]
*  they can't employ radios where it talk with Secret Service is damning. I mean, this could cost people [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=223.44s)]
*  their lives, and it did cost Corey Comparatore his life as well. But here's another thing. It [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=232.48s)]
*  would have cost them nothing to have let local law enforcement in on the fact that there was a [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=236.88s)]
*  nation-state threat against President Trump. And also some of their own local law or Secret Service [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=240.79999999999998s)]
*  agents from the Pittsburgh office didn't know that either. So it's about changing culture, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=246.72s)]
*  figuring out what happened in West Palm Beach to make sure those never happen again, but also, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=252.72s)]
*  in a strategic sense, changing the way they do business from the top down. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=258.15999999999997s)]
*  And just in the last 30 seconds or so I've got, Congressman, I want to ask you, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=262.40000000000003s)]
*  you know, it's not nothing that we've learned that the former President Trump's Wisconsin event today [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=266.24s)]
*  moved inside because of what appears to be a shortage of resources for Secret Service. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=272.08000000000004s)]
*  Again, I think that you have to start at the top. And who's the first person they have to protect? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=278.88s)]
*  The sitting president, and then the vice president, and then presidential candidates. And [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=282.72s)]
*  President Trump is right up there. He's arguably the most famous person in the world. So for them [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=286.32s)]
*  to say that they don't have the resources to protect these top three people is absolutely [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=289.76s)]
*  absurd. Start there and then go down the list because they have many protectees. So if somebody's, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=293.12s)]
*  you know, the uncle of some protectee or whatever, you know, some family member has to shave off one [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=298.32s)]
*  or two agents, well, then that's the way it has to be. But we will give them the resources that they [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=303.92s)]
*  need. I think they do have largely that in place already, but there's a few different things they [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=308.15999999999997s)]
*  need as far as a technology standpoint goes. And also using other resources because to train more [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  Secret Service agents is going to take a couple of years, Griff. Texas Congressman Pat Fallon, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=318.16s)]
*  we look forward to following the continued hearings and investigation by your task force. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UJGa7O7_M&t=323.44s)]
