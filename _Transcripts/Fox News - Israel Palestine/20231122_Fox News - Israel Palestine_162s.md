*  Egyptian state media says the temporary ceasefire starts tomorrow morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTOcT1hn8cw&t=0.0s)]
*  The pause is going to last four days initially. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTOcT1hn8cw&t=4.28s)]
*  Hamas says it will set 50 hostages free and exchange Israel, promising to release triple [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTOcT1hn8cw&t=7.28s)]
*  the number of Palestinians that are being held at Israeli jails. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTOcT1hn8cw&t=13.52s)]

*  He was my big brother. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTOcT1hn8cw&t=25.66s)]
*  He was my safe place. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTOcT1hn8cw&t=26.66s)]
*  The terrorists that are taking hostage took the safe place. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTOcT1hn8cw&t=29.32s)]
*  Every one of them need to come home and not in coffins. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTOcT1hn8cw&t=35.36s)]
*  That was 47 days ago that my heart has been buried in Gaza and every day I change the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTOcT1hn8cw&t=40.16s)]
