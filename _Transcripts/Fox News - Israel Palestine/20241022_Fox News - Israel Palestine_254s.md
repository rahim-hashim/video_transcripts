# 'DAMAGING': Former U.S. ambassador condemns Biden-Harris over 'pattern' of leaks
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs)
*  So former President Trump also reacting to this shocking leak today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=0.0s)]
*  Here he is at the roundtable in Miami. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  They leaked all the information about the way that Israel is going to fight. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=8.68s)]
*  We've given the entire Israeli game plan to the enemy. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=12.44s)]
*  Who could imagine this? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=18.6s)]
*  Who could imagine this? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  I would say Israel is not too happy about that. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  Let's bring in Nathan Sales, former U.S. Ambassador-at-Large and Coordinator for Counterterrorism under President Trump. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=26.36s)]
*  Nathan Sales, good to have you with us today. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=32.88s)]
*  I want to begin with one of your colleagues, Robert O'Brien, who spoke this morning here [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=35.08s)]
*  on Fox to get us started. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=40.56s)]
*  Let's watch this. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=42.68s)]
*  This is a very dangerous situation. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=43.68s)]
*  We've got people who are sympathetic to Iran currently in this administration. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=45.92s)]
*  They'll find the leak if they want to. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=48.88s)]
*  They've got the means to do it. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=50.32s)]
*  So if they put real investigators on it and they want to find the leak, they'll find out [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  who did it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=54.44s)]
*  Do you agree with him that this likely comes from inside the administration? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=55.68s)]
*  Well, it's certainly troubling, Martha. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=59.08s)]
*  I think we need to let the investigation play out. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=61.76s)]
*  Let's see what the FBI comes up with. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=64.44s)]
*  But certainly, this administration, we've seen a pattern of damaging, highly sensitive [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=66.75999999999999s)]
*  information being strategically leaked to the press to undermine Israel at key points [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=71.88s)]
*  throughout its war against Hamas in Gaza and also against Hezbollah. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=77.44s)]
*  Look, this sort of leak is the sort of thing that is going to further erode trust between [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=82.52000000000001s)]
*  Washington and Jerusalem. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=88.28s)]
*  You know, it comes on the heels of the Biden-Harris White House publicly pressuring Israel to [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=89.68s)]
*  sort of take a step back and downgrade its retaliation against Iran. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  And if you're Israel, this is the sort of thing that's going to cause you to lose any [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=104.2s)]
*  confidence in the Biden White House. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=108.72s)]
*  And so whoever leaked this, the irony is you've actually made Jerusalem less likely to heed [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=110.80000000000001s)]
*  the counsel of Washington because you've increased the amount of distrust between the two allies. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=118.2s)]
*  So in Israel, one of the top political analysts on the Israel Channel 12 said this. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=124.36s)]
*  There's a reason why Israel avoided informing the United States in advance about the elimination [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=130.04000000000002s)]
*  of Nasrallah and the pager operation. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=136.36s)]
*  This reason is the systemic prior leaking of Israeli operations over the past year. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=138.92s)]
*  So this is not the first time that we've seen something happen along these lines. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=143.07999999999998s)]
*  So no doubt our ally is very wary about what they can and cannot share with us at this point. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=147.24s)]
*  Well, that's exactly right, Martha. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=153.44s)]
*  There's a pattern and the pattern is very corrosive of the trust that has to exist between [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=155.04s)]
*  two close allies. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=162.88s)]
*  Israel is our closest ally in the region. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=163.8s)]
*  It's the only democracy in the region. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=166.35999999999999s)]
*  It faces the same enemies that we do, the Islamic Republic of Iran and its network of [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=168.6s)]
*  terror proxies, the same terrorists that are trying to kill Israelis or trying to kill [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=173.64s)]
*  Americans. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=178.28s)]
*  So trust has to be at the heart of this relationship, as it was in the past under President Trump, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=178.92s)]
*  certainly, but also under Democratic administrations in the past. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=185.44s)]
*  And unfortunately, under President Biden and Vice President Harris's leadership, that trust [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=188.84s)]
*  started to erode and elements of the administration seem to feel that they are empowered to continually [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=194.12s)]
*  leak damaging, harmful information. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=200.84s)]
*  That's not going to help Israel. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=203.44s)]
*  It's not going to help the United States. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=204.8s)]
*  One last thing I need to say about this, Martha, just the other day we got word that Yaya [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=206.16000000000003s)]
*  Sinwar, the recently departed head of Hamas, was deciding on the basis of American leaks and [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=210.8s)]
*  American pressure on Israel that he was going to hold out for better terms in hostage talks. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=216.96s)]
*  So these leaks are actually making it harder for Israel to conclude a deal to get their [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=223.68s)]
*  hostages back. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=229.04000000000002s)]
*  And it's not just Israeli hostages. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=230.04000000000002s)]
*  There's Americans in those tunnels as well. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=231.84s)]
*  Yeah. And that calculus is keeping those Americans in that tunnels, in those tunnels. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=233.8s)]
*  Nathan, thank you. Nathan Sales. Good to see you. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=238.28s)]
*  Thank you, Martha. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akre8wFzfIs&t=240.96s)]
