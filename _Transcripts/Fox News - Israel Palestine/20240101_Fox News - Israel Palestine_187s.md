# US sinks 3 ships helmed by Iran-backed fighters after Red Sea attacks
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [January 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8)
*  A major escalation in the Middle East, the U.S. military destroying three boats that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=0.0s)]
*  ambushed a container vessel in the Red Sea. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  The Iran-backed Houthis were behind that attack. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=9.52s)]
*  Congressman Michael Waltz applauded this U.S. response but says it's time to go after Iran [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=12.36s)]
*  directly. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=17.56s)]
*  This is an attack on the whole world because 20 percent of global trade passes through [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=19.52s)]
*  that sea. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=24.16s)]
*  Sometimes you have to escalate to de-escalate but this administration is so afraid of escalation [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=25.24s)]
*  eventually Jason one of these missiles are going to get through. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=31.88s)]
*  It's going to sink one of our ships. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=34.68s)]
*  Iran looks like the tough guy around the Middle East and the United States once again under [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=36.48s)]
*  Joe Biden looks feckless and weak. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=41.94s)]
*  Trey Yengst is in Tel Aviv, Israel following all of this for us. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=45.599999999999994s)]
*  Trey good morning. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=49.04s)]
*  Yeah Molly good morning. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=52.24s)]
*  This happened yesterday morning according to Central Command. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=53.24s)]
*  U.S. Navy helicopters responded to a distress call from a container ship in the Red Sea [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=56.6s)]
*  that was being attacked by four Houthi small boats. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=62.36s)]
*  Now we understand that those American helicopters arrived and they were fired upon before returning [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=65.76s)]
*  fire and sinking three out of the four vessels. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=71.16s)]
*  Ten rebels were killed according to the Houthis. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=74.72s)]
*  This major escalation in the Red Sea does come as it was an active New Year's in the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=77.28s)]
*  Middle East. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=82.04s)]
*  Just after the clock struck midnight Hamas fired a barrage of rockets toward Tel Aviv. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=83.04s)]
*  Hours before that protests erupted in Tel Aviv as demonstrators called on David Barnea, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=87.72s)]
*  the head of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency, to cut a deal to release the remaining hostages [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=92.88s)]
*  inside Gaza. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=98.32s)]
*  It is day 87 of the war between Israel and Hamas and there is no diplomatic solution [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=99.72s)]
*  in sight. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=104.6s)]
*  This is the New Year Eve and everyone is supposed to be happy but we are not happy. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=106.86s)]
*  We cannot be happy because our beloved is somewhere under the ground at the Gaza Strip [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=112.62s)]
*  and we want them home today. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=119.98s)]
*  The calls for a deal come as Hamas told regional media they won't release the remaining hostages [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=124.26s)]
*  until all the fighting ends but fierce battles are ongoing today specifically around the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=128.54s)]
*  city of Hanunis. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=133.5s)]
*  It does come as the Israelis say they will withdraw some reservists from Gaza in a move [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=135.06s)]
*  they say will prepare the country for a prolonged war. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=138.96s)]
*  Overnight Israel launched new airstrikes targeting positions in central Gaza and officials say [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=142.62s)]
*  that a Hamas-Nopa Company commander who participated in the October 7th massacre was killed during [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=147.62s)]
*  the recent operations. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=153.64000000000001s)]
*  Now the remains and fighting inside Gaza does come as the entire region is looking to other [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=155.22s)]
*  fronts including the Red Sea. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=161.24s)]
*  There is real concern that the Houthis could try to expand this conflict firing on Israel [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=163.48s)]
*  more often and of course those U.S. vessels that are patrolling the area. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=168.51999999999998s)]
*  Molly? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=172.76s)]
*  No doubt a lot of people monitoring for the response there. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=173.76s)]
*  Trey Yanks, thank you. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwggbqIH8&t=175.76s)]
