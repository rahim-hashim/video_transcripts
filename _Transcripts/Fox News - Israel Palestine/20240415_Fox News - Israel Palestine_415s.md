# Who is organizing this 'hate America' movement?: Harris Faulkner
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg)
*  Garrett, Kenny is live in Chicago with more details on this disturbing movement. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=0.0s)]
*  Garrett. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=5.0s)]
*  Yeah, Emily, this is not just any crowd. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=6.0s)]
*  This was a group of around 300 people from pro-Palestinian and anti-war groups across [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=8.28s)]
*  the country who came to Chicago to work on plans for disrupting the Democratic National [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=12.56s)]
*  Convention less than four months from now. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=17.28s)]
*  And you saw how the crowd reacted when organizers announced the news of Iran's attacks. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=19.84s)]
*  But even before that, during a breakout session, one organizer taught attendees how to chant [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  death to Israel in Farsi. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=29.84s)]
*  And the enthusiastic crowd then took it a step further calling for chants of death [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=31.88s)]
*  to America. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=37.68s)]
*  So I'm going to teach you a chant in Persian that you can use if you ever encounter those [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=38.68s)]
*  Zionist freaks. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=44.84s)]
*  So you're going to say, Mar Bar. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=45.84s)]
*  Mar Bar. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=48.84s)]
*  Mar Bar Israel. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=49.84s)]
*  Mar Bar Israel. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=50.84s)]
*  Mar Bar Israel. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=51.84s)]
*  Mar Bar Israel. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=52.84s)]
*  Mar Bar Israel. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=53.84s)]
*  Mar Bar Israel. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=54.84s)]
*  Mar Bar Israel. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=55.84s)]
*  Mar Bar Israel. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=56.84s)]
*  Mar Bar Israel. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=57.84s)]
*  Mar Bar Israel. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=58.84s)]
*  Mar Bar Israel. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=59.84s)]
*  Mar Bar Israel. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=60.84s)]
*  It has two meanings depending on who you're going to chant to. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=61.84s)]
*  It can mean death to or down with. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=62.84s)]
*  Can we chant Mar Bar America? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=63.84s)]
*  We can chant Mar Bar America. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=64.84s)]
*  Mar Bar America. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=65.84s)]
*  Mar Bar America. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=66.84s)]
*  Mar Bar America. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=67.84s)]
*  Mar Bar America. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=68.84s)]
*  Organizers also argued that President Biden is feeling the pressure as a result of their [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=69.84s)]
*  efforts and said they plan to make sure Biden and the entire Democratic Party hears them [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=86.68s)]
*  during the week of the convention. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=91.36000000000001s)]
*  We will all shout the slogan at Genocide Joe and his fellow war criminals and those powers [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  from within sight and sound of the United Center. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  From the river to the sea. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  From the sea to the sky. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=114.36s)]
*  Palestine will be free. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=119.36s)]
*  Palestine will be free. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=120.36s)]
*  And following this weekend's conference this morning we got a bit of a preview of some [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=121.36s)]
*  of what we could see during the convention as pro-Palestinian protesters blocked off [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=122.36s)]
*  the highway entrance to O'Hare International Airport bringing traffic to a standstill and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=127.6s)]
*  forcing some passengers to get out and walk along the highway to their terminals just in [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=133.16s)]
*  order to make their flights. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=138.4s)]
*  Emily? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=139.68s)]
*  Garrett Tenney, thank you so much. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=140.68s)]
*  All right, bringing this back to the couch here. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=142.92s)]
*  You and I were just talking about that. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=143.92s)]
*  That man at the podium originally, you know, he was sort of made headlines recently because [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=145.44s)]
*  he rejected meeting with White House leaders. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=149.64s)]
*  They wanted to meet with activists in Chicago. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  But never mind the raid that the FBI conducted on his house in 2010 for potentially providing [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=154.44s)]
*  material support to terrorist organizations. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=159.76s)]
*  There's a lot to unpack here. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=162.68s)]
*  But at the end of the day what we're seeing is fomenting of American hatred on our soil. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=164.2s)]
*  So where do you find the people to sit in a room led by a man whose home has been raided [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=169.79999999999998s)]
*  by the FBI, who's a bad actor and we know it, to teach them to go from English to Farsi? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=176.44s)]
*  Who are these Americans who say, you know what, let's all meet at his house at five [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=183.35999999999999s)]
*  or wherever they're meeting? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=187.62s)]
*  I'm curious about that. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=189.16s)]
*  This is now, and we said it earlier as we were going to the commercial break, and I [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=190.84s)]
*  thought about it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=194.16s)]
*  Is it really a movement? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=195.16s)]
*  Well, apparently it's becoming one. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=196.16s)]
*  And what is the movement? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=198.23999999999998s)]
*  That we hate our own country? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=199.23999999999998s)]
*  We hate our own people? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=201.28s)]
*  We hate ourselves, I guess, is an extension to that? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=203.11999999999998s)]
*  Where are we going with this? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=206.23999999999998s)]
*  And what happened to all the people who wanted to feed the Palestinians? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=207.23999999999998s)]
*  Oh, I guess they don't really want to do that. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=209.76s)]
*  Right, because as you put earlier, how is this helping them to get food? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=212.56s)]
*  And Rebecca, I feel that this is actually a predictable thread, an insidious one, because [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=216.44s)]
*  we were allowing death to Israel and that horrid hatred under this administration in [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=220.76s)]
*  the last months as well. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=225.32s)]
*  Is this a natural progression of that? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=226.8s)]
*  Well, look, you just start peeling layers. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=228.24s)]
*  So it's anti-Jewish hate, but then it's actually genocide against Israel because they're cheering [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=229.72s)]
*  on Iran for attacking the Jewish state. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=235.0s)]
*  But then they jump right over to anti-American sentiments. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=237.84s)]
*  You're like, what is going on here? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=240.88000000000002s)]
*  This kind of sentiment really grows. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=242.78s)]
*  This toxic social contagion, which is anti-Semitism, is a symptom of grievance culture, anti-Americanism, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=244.44s)]
*  anti-West, which is why I always take this deeply, deeply seriously. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=251.68s)]
*  One more point on the rise of anti-Semitism. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=256.32s)]
*  Since October 7th to January 30th this year, the Bureau, the FBI opened more than three [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=259.08s)]
*  times more anti-Jewish hate crime investigations than in the previous four months. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  I mean, this is terrible for our Jewish Americans in this country. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=269.36s)]
*  What do we got to do to get attention on these people? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=274.32s)]
*  Maybe if they had tiki torches and khakis and polos like we saw in Charlottesville when [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=276.24s)]
*  the whole country was angry about that. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=280.48s)]
*  But because these people really are coming from all walks of life and really kind of [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=283.04s)]
*  have this very leftist view, it's like it's almost like it's not that big of a deal. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=286.84000000000003s)]
*  I keep in mind where it's happening. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=291.6s)]
*  That's Chicago. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=293.08000000000004s)]
*  And Michigan. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=294.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=295.08000000000004s)]
*  And we ran that earlier today on America's Newsroom. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=296.08000000000004s)]
*  I didn't notice the sign behind him. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=298.08000000000004s)]
*  That's DNC 2024. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=300.16s)]
*  That's third week of August, hot August night on the streets of Chicago. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=301.56s)]
*  I think it's a confounding world when John Fetterman continues to defy his Democratic [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=307.24s)]
*  colleagues. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=310.96000000000004s)]
*  He went on CNN on Sunday and said, it's astonishing that we're not standing firmly with Israel. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=312.40000000000003s)]
*  And he said, if you launch hundreds of drones toward Israel, I'm not going to be talking [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=317.44s)]
*  about conditions ever. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=321.0s)]
*  I think the Wall Street Journal nailed it. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=322.56s)]
*  They said, you know, end the Cold War with Israel over Gaza and recognize and understand [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=324.2s)]
*  that the war is against Iran. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=329.24s)]
*  There are people in this administration who believe that and think that and will decide [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=332.16s)]
*  that way. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=336.32s)]
*  I don't know if there are enough, but we'll see. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=337.32s)]
*  Did you notice that the folks in Chicago, the people who were applauding the Iranian [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=340.52s)]
*  attack, they're anti anti-war protesters. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=345.35999999999996s)]
*  So how funny is it? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=350.03999999999996s)]
*  How quickly does it go? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=351.68s)]
*  And the anti-war ceasefire now crowd start to applaud violence when it's directed at [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=353.0s)]
*  Israel. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=357.32s)]
*  So their movement is clearly mislabeled. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=358.32s)]
*  And then as for this death to America stuff, I mean, infuriating for obvious reasons and [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=360.79999999999995s)]
*  also so dangerous because when you start to see a group of people doing that, that could [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=365.56s)]
*  incite somebody to violence. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=369.8s)]
*  So you clearly have anti-American sentiment in the United States already. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=371.36s)]
*  Couple that with the porous border, couple that with the rise of ISIS case since we left [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=374.76s)]
*  Afghanistan. General Frank McKenzie recently said, believe these terrorist organizations [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkKqMutchSg&t=378.24s)]
